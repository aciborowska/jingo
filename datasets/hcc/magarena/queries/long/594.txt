I have been testing the latest builds on a very low spec AspireOne and linux mint running in VBox on my main high-spec PC. On the aspire it is generally at the limit when animating and can be quite jerky sometimes. In linux animation is generally fine given the limits of the VBox graphics drivers in a linux guest.

When testing the very latest build on these two platforms I noticed that the busy throbber was very jerky and the animation extremely jerky to the point of being non-existent. There was a definite feeling of sluggishness to gameplay.

Since then I have gone back through previous builds looking for the point at which this started and I believe it to be [build 494](https://circleci.com/gh/magarena/magarena/494). This is where [I added](https://github.com/magarena/magarena/commit/fe3412f0295c156ce809577caa862e5f2b1d165f) `synchronized` to `loadAbilities()`. I wondered whether this might have side-effects!

I am 90% sure this is the cause, but as yet I don't know why. @melvinzhang, @ShawnieBoy please could you test build 494 and 493 and see if you notice any differences in performance. Thanks.
