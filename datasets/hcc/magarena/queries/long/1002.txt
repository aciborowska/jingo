Needs Testing:

The token copies created by [Heat Shimmer](http://magiccards.info/lw/en/175.html) and [Minion Reflector]() should gain the ability 'At the beginning of the end step, exile/sacrifice this permanent" If that token would be copied by another effect, both should be exiled/sacrificed at the begining of he next end step.

Currently scripted as 'exile it at the beginning of the next end step' which puts the effect separate from the copied permanent.
