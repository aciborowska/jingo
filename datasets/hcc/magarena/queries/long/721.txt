a few times 1.70 crashed and a few of those involved reanimation I think.

here is a log from 1.71 where it crashed just after putting Sphynx of the Steel Wind into play with Exhume.
it isn't just me I think firemind has occasional crashes with this reanimator deck.  They have worked ok in the past though I think but not sure this exact creature was in it.
