from issue #214.

> When playing against AI, if AI plays a face-down creature with Morph and I hover mouse cursor over the face-down card, I can see what the card actually is, as it will just pop up. The face-down card should be invisible to me (when it is controlled by an opponent), as per rules only the controller can peek at the card.
