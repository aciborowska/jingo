Ok, this is a strange scenario anyway, but Magarena makes it stranger.

Player attacks with Creature-A, owned by the AI, but enchanted with Illusory Gains.
The AI blocks with Ætherplasm.
The AI chooses to return Ætherplasm to its hand.
The AI plays Creature-B blocking Creature-A.
- now the tricky part.
  The Illusory Gains attaches to Creature-B.
  This returns Creature-A to the AI's control and puts Creature-B under the Players control.

As control has changed, both should be removed from combat, but both still appear in the centre of the 'battle area', only in swapped positions, so that the attacker becomes the blocker (and vice versa).

No combat damage is dealt (thankfully) as they're not in combat anymore.

Is this due to the creature coming into play blocking? Brimaz, King of Oreskos does something similar, but with tokens. Or does removal from combat from control change not get to the UI?
