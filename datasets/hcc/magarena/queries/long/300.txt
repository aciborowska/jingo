After implementing [Gilder Bairn](http://magiccards.info/eve/en/152.html), I've been testing it with the AI, and discovered it doesn't use it at all.

This is also with a 'perfect' set up of a [Paradise Mantle](http://magiccards.info/mma/en/211.html) and creatures with tokens.

Even with two of each, and one of the Bairns with a counter on it, it still won't activate the abilities, even when one became tapped by attacking (with enough mana to activate).

Groovy code here, as I'm loathe to submit this as is:

``` groovy
[
    new MagicPermanentActivation(
        [MagicCondition.CAN_UNTAP_CONDITION],
        new MagicActivationHints(MagicTiming.Pump),
        "+Counter"
    ) {
        @Override
        public Iterable<MagicEvent> getCostEvent(final MagicPermanent source) {
            return [new MagicUntapEvent(source), new MagicPayManaCostEvent(source, "{2}{G/U}")];
        }
        @Override
        public MagicEvent getPermanentEvent(final MagicPermanent source,final MagicPayedCost payedCost) {
            return new MagicEvent(
                source,
                TARGET_PERMANENT, //Plus artificial TARGET_PERMANENT_WITH_COUNTERS?
                this,
                "For each counter on target permanent\$, PN puts another of those counters on that permanent."
            );
        }
        @Override
        public void executeEvent(final MagicGame game, final MagicEvent event) {
            event.processTargetPermanent(game, {
                for (final MagicCounterType counterType : MagicCounterType.values()) {
                    if (it.hasCounters(counterType)) {
                        game.doAction(new ChangeCountersAction(it, counterType, it.getCounters(counterType)));
                    }
                }
            });
        }
    }
]
```
