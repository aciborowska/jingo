To replicate, create a new duel in 1.61 and select Standard cube. Start game so duel settings are saved. Install 1.62 and import 1.61 settings, then in 1.62 start a new duel and it appears the last settings used in 1.61 are restored (Cube = Standard is displayed) but if you open the duel settings dialog the cube defaults to All instead of Standard. It stays like this until a new game is started and the duel settings saved. It then restores correctly after this including a restart.
