Cards such as the Vivid lands and lands similar to Abandoned Outpost:

```
{T}: Add <color> to your mana pool. 
<cost>: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.
```

Should have a color-frame matching the single `<color>` it can produce, not a gold frame. Multi-color checking needs improvement for land colors.
