When prompted to scry the library zone button flashes and is highlighted. The top N cards are displayed. If you select another zone it is not possible to get back to the scryed cards via the library zone button - it is disabled. The only way is to select the small icon tab button which is inconsistent. This lack of functionality is also preventing removal of the vertical tab/zone icons (see #86).
