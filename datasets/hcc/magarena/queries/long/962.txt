Once the opponent has `Grand Abolisher`, I can't do anything at all - not even play a land during my turn. 

`Grand Abolisher` is supposed to only prevent casting during its controller's turn - looks like there might be a bug in its script that makes this effect active at all times.

Gameplay report attached.
