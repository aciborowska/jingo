When running a new version of Magarena for the first time and selecting "New Duel" from the main menu, three default AI player profiles will be created.

The code for getting the default AI player shown in the New Duel screen will not necessarily return the same one each time since not only is it based on a HashMap which does not guarantee order but also the HashMap is populated by using `getProfilePaths` and a `DirectoryStream` which does not appear to be ordered in any way.

So really, `getDefaultAiPlayer` should really be named `getDefaultRandomAiPlayer`.

Update to always return the expected default profile - MCTS.
