[Fumiko the Lowblood](http://magiccards.info/c15/en/155.html) should be recognised as having the Bushido ability, she's currently coded to have a functionally similar Bushido X effect.
Not overly important except for implementing [Takeno, Samurai General](http://magiccards.info/chk/en/46.html) and any other abilities that check for the Bushido ability.
