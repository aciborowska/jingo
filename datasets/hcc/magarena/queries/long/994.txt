[Crypt Rats](http://magiccards.info/7e/en/125.html) is implemented as:
`{B}: Deal 1 damage to each creature and each player` instead of 
`{X}: Deal X damage to each creature and each player. Spend only black mana on X.`

Damage should be dealt in one 'burst'.
The Absorb ability (see [Lymph Sliver](http://magiccards.info/fut/en/26.html)) and [Urza's Armor](http://magiccards.info/8e/en/318.html) type effects shouldn't be able to prevent all damage from Crypt Rats.
