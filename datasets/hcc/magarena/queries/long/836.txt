While looking over card images and urls - I've found that the card image numbers don't match between full image and crops.

From a fresh install:
card images show 11077 playable and 4872 unimplemented
cropped images show 11307 playable and 4872 unimplemented

I'd imaging cropped images to show a lower number, not higher.
