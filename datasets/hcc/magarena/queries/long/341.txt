I control some creatures that were temporarily taken over from computer by the ability of Tibalt, the Fiend-Blooded. The computer doesn't currently control any creatures.

I have Pyroclasm in hand, and enough lands to cast it. I want to play Pyroclasm in order to kill the creatures I currently control, before they return to the opponent. But the computer won't let me - the card is not highlighted and doesn't react to a click.

May be related to issue #266.
