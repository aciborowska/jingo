Cards which enter the battlefield as a copy of another card/permanent have a few bugs and inconsistencies which require looking at.

On the whole it's a veritable minefield of problems, for the game in real life, and for Magarena.

Currently it is functioning as a 'when cast' effect instead of an 'enters the battlefield' effect, so entering the battlefield in other ways is not activating the ability.

Even when it does enter the battlefield, it doesn't trigger enter the battlefield abilities from other permanents regarding the copy's attributes, e.g. A copied Ally will not trigger other Ally abilities.
#93 Also shows that removing the copied target is countering the spell due to no valid targets. (This may have been fixed)

I was wondering if an enters the battlefield replacement effect could return the card to the stack with the copied attributes.
