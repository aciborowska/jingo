Aura Thief dies, you gain control of all Enchantments.
The opponents permanents it controls from 'you control enchanted' don't change control.

May need to double-check some ruling on this, but I would expect the 'you control' effects would refer to the new controller of those effects when they change control.

control, control, control, control... hehe
