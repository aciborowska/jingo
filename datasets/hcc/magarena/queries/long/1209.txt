> I use this pull request to propose a (purely hypothetical) bug fix, if you don't mind: I think the strings in the translation file are hashed in such a way that, if the original strings are the same, the hash is also the same, and thus two copies of the same string can't coexist. This works for most sentences, but when used for “P” (abbreviation used for both “played”, in played/won/lost games/duels, and “power”), it creates an equality that doesn't hold for most languages. I suggest that you change one of them to “ P ” or use the invisible whitespace that exists in Unicode to make the strings different.

In the translation file 
```
...
# 3110715001 eg. player mini-stats heading representing games and duels [P]layed
3110715001 = ▫P
...
```
But this is also used as the column heading in explorer/deck tables to refer to [P]ower which obviously works in English but not when Played and Power are translated.
