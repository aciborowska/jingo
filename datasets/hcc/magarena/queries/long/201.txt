I've put together Rishadan Pawnshop, understandably it's a bit of a strange card, but try as I might, I can't get the AI to stop shuffling itself into the deck short of giving it a "target other nontoken permanent you control".

This version has a MagicRegenerateTargetPicker as I was hoping it would try and use it as a permanent 'rescue' card, in lieu of a regenerate ability. However this seems to have the same effect as having a MagicExileTargetPicker.

Is there some way to get this card to play fair, or is it just a bit too 'weird' for the AI?

        @Override
        public Iterable<MagicEvent> getCostEvent(final MagicPermanent source) {
            return [
                new MagicPayManaCostEvent(source, "{2}"),
                new MagicTapEvent(source)
            ];
        }

        @Override
        public MagicEvent getPermanentEvent(final MagicPermanent source, final MagicPayedCost payedCost) {
            return new MagicEvent(
                source,
                choice,
                MagicRegenerateTargetPicker.create(),
                this,
                "PN shuffles target nontoken permanent he or she controls\$ into its owner's library."
            );
        }

        @Override
        public void executeEvent(final MagicGame game, final MagicEvent event) {
            event.processTargetPermanent(game, {
                game.doAction(new RemoveFromPlayAction(it, MagicLocationType.OwnersLibrary));
            });
        }
    }
]
