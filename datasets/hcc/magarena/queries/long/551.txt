I have `Puresteel Paladin`, `Auriok Sunchaser`, `Mask of Avacyn`, and enough artifact lands to get _Metalcraft_. All lands are currently tapped (so no mana source).

In M1, I equip `Auriok Sunchaser` with `Mask of Avacyn` and attack. The expectation is that, in M2 after the attack, I would be able to switch the equipment over to `Puresteel Paladin`, for defense. But the computer won't let me - after the attack, it skips M2 and goes straight to opponent's turn. It's as if `Equip 0` doesn't count as an effect worthy of prompt.

Tried to attach gameplay-report.zip, but for some reason Github won't accept it: "Unfortunately, we donâ€™t support that file type."
