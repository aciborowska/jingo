The checking of the amount of counters on [Decree of Silence](http://magiccards.info/sc/en/32.html) isn't a static check, it only looks once a spell is countered and a counter added.
If a counter is put onto the Decree from another source (eg. proliferate, or [Gilder Bairn](http://magiccards.info/eve/en/152.html)) it won't be sacrificed until is causes a spell to be countered again.

It's an 'If' clause not 'Whenever'
