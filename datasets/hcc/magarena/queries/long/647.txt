Thought it was other permanents entering the battlefield triggering it, but in my scenario (Hopefully it will occur the same in this report) AI plays Rogue Kavu, which triggers the Talisman which then triggers the Oni.
During combat, the AI casts Fault Line, which triggers the Talisman which then triggers the Oni.

All very strange...
