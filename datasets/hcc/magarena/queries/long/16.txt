uh-oh, that's my fault, didn't check it before submit, since it was Opalescence clone (only the filter is different). I'll check it later and resubmit

Edit: can't seem to find what's wrong with it. The groovy code seems fine (exactly the same as Opalescence, except for the accept condition that is not necessary and for the filter). From my tests, it seems to work, but the converted mana cost it gets is alwys zero (as soon as I play it, every non creature artifact is sent to the graveyard).
