For example, using TestScry.
1. Pass twice to get to M2
2. Undo to return to DA
3. Expect to see hand zone, but instead sees empty "Choose a card" zone

A related issue is any click of undo will briefly show the empty "Choose a card" zone before showing the correct zone.

Again, using TestScry.
1. Pass once to get to DA
2. Undo to return to M1
3. Expect no change in hand shown, but instead UI flickers to show an empty "Choose a card" zone then flickers back to showing the hand.

@lodici seems to have been caused by 9fd38035a73b4af addition of `clearCardsToChoose()` to performUndo
