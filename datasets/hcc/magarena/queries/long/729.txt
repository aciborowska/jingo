Not sure if this is a bug, but I have tried to rule out other possible causes and this looks like the preferred place to post issues.

'Download card images' has been behaving strangely for me (new user, magarena 1.70).  When I use it, it will rapidly download some images correctly, interspersed with error 503's, e.g.:

java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 503 for URL: http://magiccards.info/scans/en/tsts/55.jpg [Avalanche Riders.jpg]

After about 200 correct downloads and 100 error 503's, it will then switch to slowly timing out, e.g.:

java.net.SocketTimeoutException: connect timed out [Black Oak of Odunos.jpg]

Additionally, at that point, magiccards.info (which previously responded to all requests from me) will time out on all requests for a period of time I haven't been able to determine (maybe 24 hours?).  After that time passes, I can restart the whole thing and get another 200 or so correct downloads.

The surprising thing is that I _can_ access those exact addresses via HTTP without an error 503 (or any other problem), in a web browser.  (Through a proxy, currently, as I'm getting timed out again.)

I have gotten the same behavior on multiple computers, on my home and work networks, with antivirus software disabled, etc., and traceroute turns up no other problems.  My guess is that magiccards.info is blacklisting my IP because of all the rapid error 503's.  Not sure what's causing those but it doesn't seem to be the URL, at least.  Full errors from last session below.
