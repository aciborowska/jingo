I have been able to replicate in Windows 7. I have been using 8.0_72 and downloaded and installed the latest version 8.0_101 but without removing 8.0_72. I updated JAVA_HOME and `java -version` returns 101 and when I double-click the jar it uses 101 as expected. BUT, when I run Magarena.exe it still uses 72 for some reason. If I rename the 8.0_72 JRE folder (ie. so it is not effectively installed) and run the exe I get the above error.
