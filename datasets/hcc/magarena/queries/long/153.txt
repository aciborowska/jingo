Computer attacks with a black creature. I block with Phantom Centaur.

Expected: all damage is prevented due to protection from black; +1/+1 counters remain intact.
Actual: Phantom Centaur loses one counter.

There's even a [ruling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=phantom+centaur) specifically addressing this case:

> If this card is going to take damage from a black source, you can choose to apply Protection from Black's damage prevention ability prior to applying this card's built-in ability. This means you don't have to remove a counter.

Nothing useful in the log:

```
LOG (C): Computer attacks with Drana, Kalastria Bloodchief.
LOG (P): Igor blocks with Phantom Centaur.
LOG (C): Drana, Kalastria Bloodchief is destroyed.
```
