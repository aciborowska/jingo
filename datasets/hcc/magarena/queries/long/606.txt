Been around for far too long this. Once you start a game Magarena forgets the deck names, they just become "Unsaved deck". This is actually quite irritating if you find you are enjoying playing a particular deck but forget its name. Likewise when reporting gameplay issues or bugs, knowing the decks used would be helpful. Would probably be useful to add the deck name to the log file as well.
