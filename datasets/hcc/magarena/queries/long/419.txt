LogBookViewer progressively slows down game

hey the LogBookViewer is causing serious slowdown. gets worse the longer a duel gets. toggling log on and off in ui has no effect. so i commented most of the LogBookViewer.java code out and rebuilt and hey viola, game is running perfectly even in very long duels. might wanna have that looked at in more depth.
