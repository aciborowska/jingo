I play `Lava Axe`, then copy it with `Reverberate`. But before `Reverberate` resolves, AI plays `Twincast` - and chooses to copy `Reverberate`. When this second `Reverberate` resolves, AI needs to choose a spell to copy - and chooses `Reverberate` again (the first one that I played). Lather, rinse, repeat.
