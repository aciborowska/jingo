I was playing against the MCTS AI (me: Legacy Mono Black from FireMinds, AI: Legacy Bogles – the new one with no Slivers – from FireMinds). First, the AI played Hoofprints of the Stag, but subsequently always declined the hoofprint token. I cannot think of any reason to do this, ever. Then the AI played Journey to Nowhere when no creatures were in play. Once again, why do this, ever?
More importantly (perhaps), when the AI tried to play Argothian Enchantress, my Mac spun up, fully occupying all 8 processors (dual 2.2 GHz quad-core Intel i7, 16GB RAM), then crashed.  Crash report follows. I note that it says it ran out of memory, but at the head of the crash report, it says that Magarena hadn't used it's entire allocation.  Is this something I can affect? If so, how can I improve the performance?
