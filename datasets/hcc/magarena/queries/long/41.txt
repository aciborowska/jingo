One of the updates in 1.56 (f97d149a91a57cee47d9c9da98e4298bb96ca9ea) was to pause the game when the card popup is displayed during a game. The primary rationale behind this was that it could be a bit disconcerting when the AI plays a card and the animation occurs "behind" the open popup - the whole point of the animation being so that you clearly follow what the AI is doing (AI comes across as trying to sneak a play while you are looking at your card!). Also, when manually displaying the popup using the mouse wheel it seems natural to pause the game while you study the card (that is what DOTP does). However, I am not so sure it is desirable when auto-popup is active, where the popup is more likely to be open inadvertently.

Perhaps there should be a clearer indication when the game is paused? Or disable pause when in auto-popup mode? Or make optional by adding a setting to pause game on popup? Or remove pause game option entirely?
