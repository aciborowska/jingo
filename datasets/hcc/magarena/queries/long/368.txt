Having two Coldsteel Hearts or Sol Grails in play (Or any other amount of permanents which have a 'choose a colour' can tap for that colour mana ability) should be defined as unique if they produce different colours.

If you have more than one in play, you are forced to always use the oldest one first for colorless mana production. If they each produce different colour mana, you may be forced to tap one that can produce a colour you want later that turn.
