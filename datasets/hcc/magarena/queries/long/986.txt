It's opponent's M2. The computer has `Myr Enforcer` with `Cranial Plating` attached, 11/4 (P/T). I play `Grasp of Darkness` on it. I can see its P/T go to 7/0 for a brief moment, while the phase indicator moves to ET then CU, at which point its P/T reverts to 11/4 and it remains in play.

I can't catch the game report in the exact moment this happens, so I'm attaching one from right before and another from right after. Maybe that'll help.
