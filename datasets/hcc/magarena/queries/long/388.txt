A number of recent builds (including the [latest](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/magarena/job/magarena/1459/)) all seem to have stopped at 2 hours exactly with grey status indicators (the console out says aborted). The fact that they are all 2 hours looks like some sort of timeout.

In general the time it takes to do a build is ridiculous - I am pretty sure this is not how CI is supposed to work. Why can't we have different build configurations - one with a comprehensive test that is run once per day at a scheduled time and another with none or a much smaller testing pool that is triggered on a commit.

Also is there some indication that the build artifacts associated with an aborted run are the correct ones and not just the last successful ones?
