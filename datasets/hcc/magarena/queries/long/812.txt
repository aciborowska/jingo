This is more noticeable with the Emerge mechanic, where an activated ability of a colorless card contains a color.

The Emerge cards are being included in mono-color decks regardless of their activation cost color. e.g. Wretched Gryff in a mono-red deck. This would also include any colorless artifacts with colored activations. e.g. Spellbombs, Trigons etc.
