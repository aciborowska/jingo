Thank you for creating Magarena.

When using "Champion of Lambholt", I've noticed that my opponent is able to block with creatures of lesser power. In the game attached to this post, I have 4 +1/+1 counters on it, and a "Stone Throwing Devils" controlled by my opponent (which is a 1/1) was able to block.

I don't think this was a special circumstance (such as Lambholt's ability being disabled in some way). Is this happening because Stone Throwing Devils is black?
