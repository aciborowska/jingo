Cards which can tap for a color or for colorless, do not show the colorless mana symbol - eg. Tainted Isle

Would also be nice if mana production with a condition (the tainted lands) would show the colors they can actually produce. No colored mana symbols showing unless a swamp is in play for the tainted lands.
