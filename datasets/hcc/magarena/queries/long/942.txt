ok so defense of the heart did definitely fetch helm of obedience and rest in peace by the ai.

this was good in that it was a winning play but bad in that they aren't creatures.

Also saw the Tarmogoyf doesn't count the card you cast last as being in the gy   again.e.g. killing it with lightning bolt with it at 3 toughness with no instants in gy works which it shdn't.  But I may have overwritten the gameplay report with this one sorry.
