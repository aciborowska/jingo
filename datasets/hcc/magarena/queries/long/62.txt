So I was toying around with a new deck, and for some reason Magarena seems to slow down considerably with this deck. More than with others. It's not just the AI taking time either. Every few clicks the game will pause for a second, the spinner doesn't move at all. It's like the UI is freezing. This starts happening after 5-10 turns, and after 20 or so turns the game becomes unplayable. The same thing happens with all AIs.

The deck strategy is very nonstandard. The first few turns you need to prevent damage until you have a few lands, then use Time of Need or Captain Sisay to search for Azusa, Lost but Seeking. Then keep searching for legendary lands, and combo Buried Alive with Volrath's Stronghold and Loyal Retainers to get the big dragons out. Probably not going to win any tournaments, but it's weirdly fun!

Here's the deck. I'm using a lot of legendary lands, maybe that's related?
