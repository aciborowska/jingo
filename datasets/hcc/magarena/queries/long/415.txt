Computer has Warstorm Surge in play, and casts Zhur-Taa Swine, directing damage to one of my creatures. There's nothing fancy in play that would prevent damage (for completeness, I have Growing Ranks enchantment; apart from that, it's just run-of-the-mill creatures and lands).

Expected: the target creature is dealt 5 damage. Actual: the creature is dealt 0 damage.

From the log:

> (C): Pay {1}{G}. Tap Forest. Tap Mountain. Play Nature's Spiral.
