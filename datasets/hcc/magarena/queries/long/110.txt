While analyzing the issues with the AI Rating Match System on firemind.ch I stumbled upon something curious.
The duels fail with different java exceptions like these:
- java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded
- java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 0, Size: 0

But they all have this deck in common: https://www.firemind.ch/deck_lists/7445

For comparison this is the whole list of duels that were run. https://www.firemind.ch/ai_rating_matches/109

The first 4 duels in the state "new" are the ones that failed. All of them have the reanimator decklist in common.

https://www.firemind.ch/duels/490331
https://www.firemind.ch/duels/490359
https://www.firemind.ch/duels/490521

I thought this information might help track down a deeper issue with the AI or a card in this deck. I will just remove the deck from the gauntlet for now.
