[Jokulmorder](http://magiccards.info/cs/en/37.html)'s last ability is scripted to function like landfall - It should only trigger when you 'Play an Island', as in one of your lands per turn (or additional lands per turn). 
An Island entering the battlefield from the graveyard or exile should not trigger an untap.
