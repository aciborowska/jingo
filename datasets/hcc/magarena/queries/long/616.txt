With Etherium Sculptor in play, (Artifact spells cost you {1} less to cast), You're unable to cast Chalice of the Void 'for free'.

Most likely due to the restriction of X not being able to be 0, even though it's actually 1.

So unable to set a value for X higher than the amount of mana available (0)
