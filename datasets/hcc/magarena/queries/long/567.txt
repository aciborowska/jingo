kannikkiy @ http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=17929&p=190003#p189990 reports the following bug:

AI casts Ainok Survivalist with morph, it goes onto the stack as "Put [face-down creature] onto the battlefield". The part in [] is a blue link, clicking on the link shows the Ainok Survivalist card in the center of the battlefield. It should show the Morph reminder card.
