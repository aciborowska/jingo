Was testing some new cards in a deck, some weren't working correctly so removed the script files.

Restarted and created a new deck with the remaining cards that were working.

Attempted to start a new Duel, crash due to not being able to find one of the removed script files.

If I'm starting a new duel it shouldn't be trying to load previous decks?
