There's a ruling stating that, when a creature enchanted with multiple totem armors would be destroyed, its controller gets to choose which (single) totem armor aura is destroyed instead:

> If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead -- but only one of them. **You choose which one** because you control the enchanted permanent. _[emphasis mine]_

In Magarena (1.55), computer automatically selects one aura in this case; the player is not given a choice.
