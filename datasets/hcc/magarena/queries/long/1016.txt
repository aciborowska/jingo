[Nature's Wrath](http://magiccards.info/ai/en/82.html) effects the player who causes a permanent to enter the battlefield, it's not a simple 'enters the battlefield' trigger.

eg 1: You control Nature's Wrath and cast [Flicker](http://magiccards.info/ud/en/9.html) on an opponent's blue creature. When it returns to the battlefield, YOU sacrifice an Island or blue permanent as you controlled the spell which caused the effect.

eg 2: You control Nature's Wrath and an opponent casts [Banisher Priest](http://magiccards.info/ddo/en/2.html) targeting one of your black creatures. You later destroy the Banisher Priest. The controller of Banisher Priest then sacrifices a Swamp or black permanent after your black creature is put onto the battlefield.
