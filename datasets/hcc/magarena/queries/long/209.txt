I'm not sure if it's something I've done with the ScryTriggers, but perform the following with TestScry.

(For each instance of scry, just put the card back/bottom - that's not the important part)

Play Temple of Silence -> Pay for Knowledge and Power targeting the AI's Flamespeaker Adept.
Let them both resolve to an empty stack.

Cast Spark Jolt targeting the Flamespeaker Adept. Let it resolve.

At this point, Knowledge and Power triggers due to the Scry action, and Flamespeaker Adept has lethal damage.

Only when Knowledge and Power resolves does the Adept die.

I'm fairly sure the Flamespeaker should die before the scry action of Spark Jolt.
