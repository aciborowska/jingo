Just an instance while testing May tense changes:

A Phantasmal Image was cast copying a Faerie Miscreant.
The log stated that a Phantasmal Image was put onto the battlefield. (Should read Faerie Miscreant - possibly where the error lies)
The enters the battlefield trigger for the Image-now-Faerie didn't trigger.

I'm assuming that the Phantasmal Image, was looking for another Phantasmal Image in play, instead of another Faerie.
