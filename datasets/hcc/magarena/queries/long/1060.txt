When the user is prompted to take some action, for example _Process with "may" action_, then when the mouse cursor is moved over the prompt panel the full size image of the card that triggered the prompt is displayed to the right which is very useful in providing context. The problem is that quite often (although not always) the image has a habit of sticking around once the mouse cursor is moved off the prompt panel and only disappears after moving the mouse randomly about the screen a few times.
