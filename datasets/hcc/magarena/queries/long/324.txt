If you skip till end of turn during an opponent's turn, it will pause when they put something on the stack for you to respond to.
If the opponent attacks, you're unable to respond to the declare attackers, and are only prompted to declare any blockers.

If attackers are declared, the skip till end of turn should stop at the declare attackers phase, allowing fast-effects during the declare attackers, and declare blockers steps.
