I've noticed quite a few duels on firemind.ch failing with a java indexOutOfBounds exception. I traced them to two places in MCTSAI.java and saw that there were some asserts that would catch those.

After changing the worker to run magarena with assertions enabled ( java -ea ... ) I'm getting these errors in about 1 out of 30 duels: 

```
Exception from controller.runGame: ERROR! Root has no children but there are 8 choices
