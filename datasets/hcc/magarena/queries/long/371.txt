Currently there's a little foible with the 'May tap or untap' phrase for the scripter. It is recognising the may choice as a choice to perform the action at all.

e.g. {T}: You may tap or untap target permanent.

The 'may' is referring to tapping or untapping (Which has it's own may choice), not if you want to do it or not.

It's currently functioning as: 

{T}: You may, may tap or untap target permanent.

As in you can activate the ability then choose for the effect to not occur.
