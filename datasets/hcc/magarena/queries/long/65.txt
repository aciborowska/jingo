I have the following lands in play:

2 of Sandsteppe Citadel (WBG)
1 Temple of Silence (WB)
1 Caves of Koilos (Colorless, or WB for one damage).

I try to play Siege Rhino (1WBG). There is enough mana to play it without taking damage, to tap Caves of Koilos for Colorless.

However, as soon as I click on Siege Rhino in my hand, computer automatically taps Caves of Koilos and causes damage, and only then lets me choose which other lands to tap.
