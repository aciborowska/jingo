To replicate, ensure play/draw animation is on. Skip your turn and AI should then play land, [Smallpox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382367), both players lose a life, AI then plays another land before you are prompted to select a card to discard. The card it plays after smallpox is in fact its discard, but the play-from-hand animation makes it look like it goes to the battlefield from which it immediately disappears having actually gone to the graveyard. The animation should not be triggered in this case.
