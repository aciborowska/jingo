The Seeker of Skybreak card working with an error. Special skill (Untap target creature) works on this card cyclically. Even if there is another card to untap. This happens when you play with minimax. Sometimes after 4-5 cycles of tap-untap AI doing something else. But mostly, the cycle is repeated continuously.
