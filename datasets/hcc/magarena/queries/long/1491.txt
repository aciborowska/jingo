Similar to #226 which was for activating abilities.

For example, Player with 2 life, mana source with "Pay 1 life: add {C} on the field" and card with casting cost of "{X}, Pay 2 life".

Player is able to cast the spell though it is impossible to pay the cost. Player will first pay 2 life, then become unable to generate at least one mana to pay {X} as the mana source requires life payment.
