Computer has `Seance` in play, and the freshly destroyed `Captain of the Watch` in the graveyard. At my next upkeep, it decides, quite sensibly, to use `Seance` effect on that `Captain of the Watch` and put a copy of it on the battlefield.

I believe this should trigger *"when `Captain of the Watch` enters the battlefield..."* effect - but it didn't; no `Soldier` tokens got created. That's kind of the whole point of `Seance`, it's pretty useless otherwise.
