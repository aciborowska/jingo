if a creature with trample and equipped with Umezawa's Jitte is blocked by a creature with thoughness less than the attackers power, Umezawa's Jitte gets double the counters. I assume the same issue is true if the attacker is blocked by more than one creature and the damage is assinged to more than one creature (then trample would not matter).

Yes, this is the multiple-target problem. Trample ends up dealing two 'lots' of damage if 'trampling over' (one amount to the creature, then another to the player as two separate damage assignments), instead of one 'lot' to two targets. Trample and lifelink (two smaller instances of lifelink, instead of a lump-sum), and other effects/triggers that rely on damage being dealt can fire too often.
