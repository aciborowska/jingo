[Copy Artifact](http://magiccards.info/me4/en/44.html) creates a copy which is also an enchantment. If a copy of it is made by another means (e.g. [Cackling Counterpart](http://magiccards.info/c14/en/100.html) with an Artifact Creature), the new copy isn't an Enchantment.

I'll put up a test/amend TestTokenCopy
