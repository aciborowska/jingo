It has always been this way as far as I can tell so I am not sure whether this is a bug or not but in the following screenshot it is `Computer`'s turn and it is waiting on `Player` to declare blockers but it displays `Computer` with priority - is this correct? I always assumed "priority" to mean "your go".
