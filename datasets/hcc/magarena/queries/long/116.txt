After playing with the newly implemented 'protection from chosen', the AI sacrificed Benevolent Bodyguard (Sacrifice SN: Target creature gets protection from the color of your choice until end of turn.) while it had no other creatures on the battlefield. I'm assuming it was intending to give the protection to itself.
