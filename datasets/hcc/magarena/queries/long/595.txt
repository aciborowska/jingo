Planeswalkers which give activated abilities are not displaying the full text. This is due to `:` normally signifying the cost of the Planeswalker ability, not any abilities mentioned in the ability text. e.g 

Freyalise, Llanowar's Fury:
+2: Put a 1/1 green Elf Druid creature token onto the battlefield with "{T}: Add {G} to your mana pool."
