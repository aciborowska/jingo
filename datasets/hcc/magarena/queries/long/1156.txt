Magarena just crashed.

I've attacked with my creatures and the AI used "Brimaz King of Oreskos" to block one of my creatures, at which point I've activated "Archbound Ravager" ability to sacrifice said blocked creature, and I suspect the game crashed because "Brimaz King of Oreskos"'s blocked creature disappeared and he didn't get to resolve his ability to create his cat soldier token even though he had blocked since technically he wasn't blocking anymore, so he freaked out and crashed the game :(
