[Golem Artisan](http://magiccards.info/som/en/159.html) has it's abilities split into separate activations. The choice of what ability to gain is made on resolution, not on activation.
If the effect is copied, another ability may be chosen.
The opponent shouldn't know which ability will be gained while it is on the stack.
