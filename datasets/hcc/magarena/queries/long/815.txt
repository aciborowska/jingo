MCTS reuses the game tree where possible by caching the tree nodes. This allows it to make use of earlier simulations.

The feature requires the game tree to contain the same nodes and options when re-encountered. When this assumption does not hold, it may lead to nodes with different number of options, causing the expansion to crash.
