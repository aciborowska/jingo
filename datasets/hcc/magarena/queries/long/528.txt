Need to decide how to handle the case when the card popup image is displayed and the play/draw card animation runs over it. Best case it looks messy but also every now and then the popup image remains open and appears unresponsive - clicking it or moving the mouse does not immediately remove it as it should. Eventually it does disappear and everything gets back to normal but there is definitely something strange going on. It is also quite hard to replicate.
