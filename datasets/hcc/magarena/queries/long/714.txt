If you sacrifice a permanent as a cost for an ability, and the source of that ability is under your control because of the sacrificed permanent, the ability will effect the owner, not controller.

To clarify this a bit, there's a TestLoseControl.

Gain control of Thelonite Druid with Sower of Temptation.
Activate the druid's ability by sacrificing the Sower.
The druid returns to the AI's control and the AI's forests become creatures.

I'm fairly sure that it should still effect you, as you were the controller of the druids when the ability was activated.
