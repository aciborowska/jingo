In the attached gameplay report, the AI keeps spawning `Restoration Angel`s with the help of `Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker`. As far as I can tell, it's going to keep doing that forever, preventing any progress in the game.

The curious thing is, the AI started doing it too late, when it couldn't actually help anymore. It could have started doing it before "declare blockers" phase, and use those Angels to block my attacking creatures. But it waited until after "declare blockers", and now it's just wasting time. Should it ever stop, it'll lose.
