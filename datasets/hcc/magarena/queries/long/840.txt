Trigger Surgespanner with two Islands in play. Target one of the Island. The Island returns to hand before the mana cost is paid, this causes the mana cost to be unpayable as you only have one Island left.

What should happen is that the mana cost is paid, then the permanent is returned to hand. Currently the order is reversed, because returning the permanent to hand is an action but mana cost is an event.
