Just remembered this older issue after submitting [Horkori, Dust Drinker](http://magiccards.info/bok/en/7.html). Hokori's ability is how we're currenly implementing 'cannot untap more than one' which is incorrect for [Stoic Angel](http://magiccards.info/ala/en/199.html) as having two in play will allow you to untap two.
