I had the Slumbering Dragon card [http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253693](url) played, but it could attack and block from the get go (it still gained counters), which was cool and all, but not what the text said.

In-universe I thought of this happening:

An Adventurer (to his companions, whispering): Alright, as long as we are quiet, we should be fine, dragons are heavy sleepers-
Dragon: My, my, what do we have here this early in the morning?
Adventurer: Oh Sh- (adventuring party is incinerated)
