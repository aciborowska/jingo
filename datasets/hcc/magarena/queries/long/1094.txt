cards don't go to graveyard when AI uses this.  Not a new bug in 1.83.   No idea what happens when a player uses it will tell you if I find out.

Ok I am pretty sure it is when the AI declines the may part of the card.  Some times it works which is presumably when the AI does pick a card as far as I can tell.
