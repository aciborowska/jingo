This is more noticeable with activated abilities on creatures (eg. firebreathing) Where the AI will pump a creature during the main phase (one of the phases for 'pump') and then not attack with it.

If pump abilities or spells are able to be used at instant speed, then the best time to use them would be the blocking phase. (Or sometimes the attacking phase _on an attacking creature_ to try and force an attack through. ie. Making it a guaranteed loss of creatures if blocked.)

As sorcery speed spells can only be cast on a main phase, would it make sense to remove the main phases for pump, or to have more variety in general and have pump (as in power/toughness gain) separate from ability gain (like lifelink etc.)
