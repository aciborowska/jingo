Until Version 1.87 of these cards were running normal. In version 1.88 they stopped working. I modified this way the scrip and returned to normal:

name=Halcyon Glaze

rarity=U
type=Enchantment
cost={1}{U}{U}

name=Daxos's Torment
image=http://magiccards.info/scans/en/c15/18.jpg
image_updated=2016-02-29
value=2.500
rarity=R
type=Enchantment
cost={3}{B}
ability=Whenever SN or another enchantment enters the battlefield under your control, SN becomes a 5/5 Demon creature with flying and haste until end of turn. It's still an enchantment.
timing=fmain
oracle=Constellation â€” Whenever Daxos's Torment or another enchantment enters the battlefield under your control, Daxos's Torment becomes a 5/5 Demon creature with flying and haste in addition to its other types until end of turn.

I'm not sure, but I think it has to do with "in addition to its other types", because when I removed it the cards worked properly. I have not tested on others besides these, but I believe everyone who has "in addition to its other types" is in the same way.
