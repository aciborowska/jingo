I activated Isochron Sceptre (having exiled Shrapnel Blast) and it did not require that I exile an artifact to activate.  According to gatherer.wizards.com, **_If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.**_
I can see how this might be difficult to implement, since elsewhere it says you aren't allowed to pay any of the cost if you cannot pay it all (although I'm not sure how that works with a two-stage play process like the Sceptre effect); that would require checking the additional costs of the exiled card before allowing the player to pay two and tap the Sceptre (but, as alluded to above, perhaps it doesn't work that way).
