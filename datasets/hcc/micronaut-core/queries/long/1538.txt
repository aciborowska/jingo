Steps to reproduce:

1. Create an entity and create dateCreated and lastModified and add beforeInsert. example:
```
@Entity
class Customer {
   Date dateCreated
   Date lastUpdated
   ...
}
```
2. Create an instance of the entity and save.

**Expected behavior**: 
`dateCreated` and `lastModified` get current time assigned to them and the `beforeInsert` gets called.

**Actual behavior**:
Record fails to save because `dateCreated` is `null` and `beforeInsert` is never called.
