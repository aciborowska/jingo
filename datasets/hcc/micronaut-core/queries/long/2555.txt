I have a library JAR compiled with 1.2.6 with a service and a method:

```
@Cacheable("phone-number-cache")
    public Maybe<String> findByPhoneNumber(String phoneNumber) {
```

When used by an application compiled with 1.3.0.M1 everything works fine but with M2 I get an error:

`No cache configured for name: null`

Coming from `DefaultCacheManager`.

In debugger I see there is an empty values map in `AnnotationValue` for `CacheConfig` in `CacheOperation` constructor.
