As the title says, I consistently experience a hang while exchanging streams of data.

The request data is a multipart request with some random bytes which are all read correctly by the controller.

A response is created by the controller which is encoded by the `RoutingInBoundHandler` but after that the client hangs.

I have created an example application that perfectly illustrates this.

UPDATE: I've checked using Wireshark and the response is sent correctly, so it's most likely an issue with the client or underlying IO implementation
