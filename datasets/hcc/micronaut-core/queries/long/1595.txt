There appears to be an issue when sending an invalid request (e.g. "...?someQuery=^") but with valid authentication credentials.

When no security is enabled, the request correctly gets handled by an ExceptionHandler that picks up the invalid request.

When security is enabled the response is 401, despite having correct credentials. It should pass the auth check, then fail at the ExceptionHandler and return a 400, but doesn't get that far.

Full details in the linked github repo.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Add security to controller
2. Have an ExceptionHandler that handles bad URIs
3. Send an authenticated request to controller that has an invalid request

### Expected Behaviour

Should get 400 thrown by the Exception Handler, as the request was authorised, but the request was invalid.

### Actual Behaviour

Get 401 unauthorized

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Micronaut Version:** 1.1.0
