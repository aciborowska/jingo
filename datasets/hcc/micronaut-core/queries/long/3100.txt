### Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure a server to correctly respond via CORS in 1.3.4 (so you will be convinced it is working) 
2. Observe that your responses (not preflight OPTIONS, but the actual response) has the header "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" present 
3. Upgrade to Micronaut 2.0.0.M2
4. Run/Deploy the service
5. Observe that your requests now lack the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.

### Expected Behaviour

The header is present

### Actual Behaviour

The header is not present

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: OSX, Alpine Linux
- **Micronaut Version:** 2.0.0.M2
- **JDK Version:** 14
