Launching two terminals, one with:
`./gradlew run --continuous`

and the other one with:
`./gradlew -t classes`

Everytime a file is modified the secondo terminal shows:

```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
2 actionable tasks: 2 up-to-date

Waiting for changes to input files of tasks... (ctrl-d to exit)
modified: /home/ubuntu/workspace/micronaut/micronautstart/src/main/java/it/ultrafab/bishop/MainController.java
Change detected, executing build...


> Task :compileJava
Note: Creating bean classes for 1 type elements
```

But in the first terminal nothing changes and the app is not reloaded.

For example, in the test controller HelloWorld.java, if you change "Hello World" with another sentence and the call the same endpoint, you will still receive the "Hello Word" response.
