When the DefaultHttpClient creates it's poolMap instance a DNS lookup is made and stored in the bootstrap instance:
`                        Bootstrap newBootstrap = bootstrap.clone(group);
                        newBootstrap.remoteAddress(key.getRemoteAddress());
`
The remoteAddress is never updated, which means that if the ip is recycled (very common for AWS hosted services), the pool will continue to try to create connections to the original ip.
