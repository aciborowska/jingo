As discussed on gitter it seems there is a breaking change with @Configuration packages and requirements due to https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/commit/d9c69f98c782d3c45eb5af9f25f1ba6f12d867b4

This for example causes an issue with the `micronaut-graphql` module which has a `package-info.java` like:

```
@Configuration
@RequiresGraphQL
package io.micronaut.configuration.graphql;

import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Configuration;
```

But in this case the `@Controller` beans in this package are not created.
