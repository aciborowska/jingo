We have a few usages of reflection that still exist in Micronaut which need removal.

* `DefaultRequestBinderRegistry` uses `ReflectionUtils.getAllInterfaces`
* `DefaultBeanContext` uses `ReflectionUtils.getAllInterfaces` 
* `RecoveryInterceptor` uses `ReflectionUtils.getAllInterfaces`

All of these are likely to result in unexpected / different behaviour on GraalVM
