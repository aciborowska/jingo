### Task List

- [x] Steps to reproduce provided
- [x] Stacktrace (if present) provided
- [x] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github
- [x] Full description of the issue provided (see below)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure a service as follows

```yaml
http:
  services:
     myservice:
        url: https//somehost.com
        ssl-configuration:  
          enable: true
          key-store:
            path: classpath:PATH_TO_CERTIFICATE.pfx
            type: PKCS12
            password: ${certificate.password}
```

### Expected Behaviour

Configuration should be taken into account and therefore, it is possible to call the service with the specified certificate.

### Actual Behaviour

SSL Handshake failure error occurred.

```
Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure
	at sun.security.ssl.Alerts.getSSLException(Alerts.java:208)
	at sun.security.ssl.SSLEngineImpl.fatal(SSLEngineImpl.java:1666)
	at sun.security.ssl.SSLEngineImpl.fatal(SSLEngineImpl.java:1634)
	at sun.security.ssl.SSLEngineImpl.recvAlert(SSLEngineImpl.java:1800)
	at sun.security.ssl.SSLEngineImpl.readRecord(SSLEngineImpl.java:1083)
	at sun.security.ssl.SSLEngineImpl.readNetRecord(SSLEngineImpl.java:907)
	at sun.security.ssl.SSLEngineImpl.unwrap(SSLEngineImpl.java:781)
	at javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine.unwrap(SSLEngine.java:624)

```

The configuration works if I configure the default client like this:

```yaml
 http:
    services:
      my-service:
        url: https//somehost.com
      ssl-configuration:
        enable: true
    client:
      ssl:
        enable: true
        key-store:
          path: classpath:PATH_TO_CERTIFICATE.pfx
          type: PKCS12
          password: ${certificate.password}
```

I am able to call the service with the certificate and everything works fine.

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: Mac OS Mojave
- **Micronaut Version:** 1.1.2
- **JDK Version:** 1.8.0_152

### Example Application

I don't have one since the certificate stuff is not public.
