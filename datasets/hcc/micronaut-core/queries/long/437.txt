It seems that when using @QueryParam in a @Controller, that can only be used, if that param is part of the path (compared to Spring's @PathVariable), but not as query param (compared to Spring's @RequestParam)

To illustrate that, I created a sample project, check https://github.com/klu2/micronaut-issue with the following controller interface: https://github.com/klu2/micronaut-issue/blob/master/src/main/java/net/klu2/micronaut/SampleApi.java

getValue and getValue2 won't be resolved correctly (check the unit test), and in the logs of the test I find:

```
io.micronaut.http.client.exceptions.HttpClientResponseException: Required argument [String id] not specified
```

It works though for getValue3, where the id is part of the path

so, the following URL works:

/api/get-value/3    --> resolves to getValue3

what does not work is:

/api/get-value1?id=3   --> should resolve to getValue
/api/get-value2?id=3   --> should resolve to getValue2
