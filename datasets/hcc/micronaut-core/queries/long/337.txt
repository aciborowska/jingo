Same command which worked for M1 seems to be broken for M2: 

```
$ sdk use micronaut 1.0.0.M1

Using micronaut version 1.0.0.M1 in this shell.
$ mn create-federation my-federation -services users,inventory,billing

$ rm -rf my-federation

$ sdk use micronaut 1.0.0.M2
Using micronaut version 1.0.0.M2 in this shell.

$ mn create-federation my-federation -services users,inventory,billing
