Wrong type of Map<String,String> in generated OpenAPI yaml.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create Micronaut app with OpenAPI yaml generation
2. have a response object with a member of type Map<String,String>
3. build app and look at generated OpenAPI yaml

### Expected Behaviour

Type of the member in response should be a proper OpenAPI type, see here:
https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/dictionaries/

### Actual Behaviour

Type is generated as Map<String,String>.

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: MacOs 10.14
- **Micronaut Version:** 1.0.4 (also tried 1.1.0.M2, did not work there either)
- **JDK Version:** 11.0.1
