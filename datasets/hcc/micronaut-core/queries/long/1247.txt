If you prefix the service names supplied to `create-federation`,  the CLI correctly generates the correct project names, but the `settings.gradle` file includes the package string along with the subproject name, which causes Gradle to not recognize the subprojects.

```
mn create-federation --services com.example.foo com.example.bar --features groovy,spock --inplace
```

`settings.gradle`:

```
include 'com.example.foo'
include 'com.example.bar'
```
