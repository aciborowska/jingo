In `2.0.0.M3`.

I'm migrating from M2 to M3 and JTW refresh token policy is now changed and requires to implement [RefreshTokenPersistence](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-security/blob/v2.0.0.M2/security/src/main/java/io/micronaut/security/token/refresh/RefreshTokenPersistence.java) bean.

This interface has `@EventListener` on the `persistToken()` method, which I'm guessing should be propagated to related implementation method in a bean. However, this doesn't work and without repeating the same annotation on overridden method this method is never called.
