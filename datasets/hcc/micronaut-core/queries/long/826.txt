I am trying to integrate Micronaut 1.0.0 (to use DI and AOP) into my project, which is a legacy monolithic Swing application. So far I cannot because I am running into a known bug where annotation processors fail once they walk over Swing classes. All I have to do to make this fail is add a Swing Frame class to a simple Micronaut example (like Hello World). 

The bug is “com.sun.tools.javac.code.Symbol$CompletionFailure: class file for sun.java2d.pipe.hw.ExtendedBufferCapabilities not found” reported at 

https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8071778

Someone on that openjdk ticket suggested in a comment a possible workaround: 
“a temporary workaround may be to use -XDignore.symbol.file=true” 
but that did not work when I added it to my gradle.build using 
`compileJava.options.compilerArgs += '-XDignore.symbol.file=true'`

### Steps to Reproduce
To reproduce this, just add anything that uses the Swing API, e.g. create a JFrame class. I have attached an example that does just that. Look at SwingFrame.java. If you comment out "extends JFrame" the annotation processing works, and the app runs. If you leave it as a JFrame class the compile phase fails, with exception noted in the openjdk ticket.

### Expected Behaviour
The application should run

### Actual Behaviour
The compile phase fails during annotation processing...

Task :compileJava FAILED
error: cannot access ExtendedBufferCapabilities
  class file for sun.java2d.pipe.hw.ExtendedBufferCapabilities not found
  Consult the following stack trace for details.
  com.sun.tools.javac.code.Symbol$CompletionFailure: class file for sun.java2d.pipe.hw.ExtendedBufferCapabilities not found
Note: Creating bean classes for 1 type elements
1 error

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
  What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':compileJava'.
Compilation failed; see the compiler error output for details.
