The current arrangement doesn't seem to work like we think it works for Maven.

The BOM imports applied in `micronaut-bom` have no impact whatsoever and conflicting versions of things like Jackson are possible.

According to https://stackoverflow.com/a/40545876/259167 multiple inheritance is not possible for parent POMs so it looks like the only option is to repeat all of the BOM imports present in `micronaut-bom` inside `micronaut-parent` as well unless there are any other ideas.
