It is a tricky issue related to [this line](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/blob/8fdb9010e1753af34aece11a9dc1c58539f3cf3e/inject/src/main/java/io/micronaut/context/env/PropertySourcePropertyResolver.java#L717):

````java
if (Character.isLetter(firstChar)) {
    int index = ((int) firstChar) - 65;
    if (index < catalog.length && index > 0) {
        entries = catalog[index];
        if (allowCreate && entries == null) {
            entries = new LinkedHashMap<>(5);
            catalog[index] = entries;
        }
    }
 }
````

If I run my app with `-DAAA=foo` I won't be able to inject `@Value("${AAA}")` because first letter is **A** and index is calculated as 65-65=**0**.

But if I run my app with `-DBBB=foo` I can inject `@Value("${BBB}")` because first letter is **B**  then index is calculated as 66-65=**1**.

O believe the fix will be something like `if (index < catalog.length && index >= 0) {}`.

Please note that it works as expected if I define properties in lower case, like `-Daaa=foo`.

Issue found using micronaut **2.0.0**.

Thanks
