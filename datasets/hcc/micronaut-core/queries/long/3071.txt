Jackson supports an annotation called `JsonUnwrapped` which _embeds_ the fields of an object in the parent. See the [documentation](https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-annotations/javadoc/2.10/com/fasterxml/jackson/annotation/JsonUnwrapped.html) for details.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Annotate a (non-public) field with `JsonUnwrapped`
2. Return object

### Expected Behaviour

The annotated field should be embedded in the parent.

### Actual Behaviour

The annotated field is added as a child as if the JsonUnwrapped annotation didn't exist.

### Environment Information

- **Micronaut Version:** 1.3.4
- **JDK Version:** 11

### Example Application

See https://github.com/lfrancke/micronaut-unwrapped
This implements the demo classes from the Jackson documentation.
There's also a `Demo` class which just calls Jackson without any of the Micronaut stuff.

Two endpoints "/1" and "/2". 

Hitting "/1":
Expected output: `{"age":20,"first":"foo","last":"bar"}`
Actual output: `{"age":20,"name":{"first":"foo","last":"bar"}}`

I believe this is due to `BeanIntrospectionModule` somehow but I don't know enough about the Micronaut internals to be sure.

Look at the second example and its output. That's even weirder. As soon as I add a second field all of a sudden both work: `{"age":20,"first":"foo","last":"bar","first":"public","last":"field"}`
