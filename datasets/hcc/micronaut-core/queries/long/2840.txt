I am seeing that if a generic ExceptionHandler is loaded first, it will be used for exceptions that have more specific ExceptionHandlers.

### Task List
- [x] Steps to reproduce provided
- [x] Stacktrace (if present) provided
- [x] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github
- [x] Full description of the issue provided (see below)

### Steps to Reproduce

Example project is provided that demonstrates the issue.

Declare 2 ExceptionHandlers one catching Throwable and another catching a custom exception CustomError. Each returns either "Global Error" or "Custom Error"

Create a controller with 2 endpoints global_error, custom_error, the first throws RuntimeException and the other throws CustomError

Call first global_error, then custom_error

### Expected Behaviour
global_error will be handled by the generic exception handler
custom_error will be handled by the custom handler

### Actual Behaviour
custom_error is handled by the generic exception handler

Tell us what happens instead
