MN 1.3.4
Kotlin.

Consider:

```
@Factory
class MyClass{
    @Singleton
    @Named(MESSAGE_BUFFER_PROCESSOR)
    fun messageExecutorService(hazelcastInstance: HazelcastInstance): IExecutorService {
        return hazelcastInstance.getExecutorService(MESSAGE_BUFFER_PROCESSOR)
    }
}
```

Hazelcast's `IExecutorService` extends from ExecutorService; because of this, the following code gets executed: https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/blob/1.3.x/runtime/src/main/java/io/micronaut/scheduling/instrument/ExecutorServiceInstrumenter.java#L80.

As a result of L80, the returned bean from `    fun messageExecutorService(hazelcastInstance: HazelcastInstance): IExecutorService` is a `ExecutorServiceInstrumenter` rather than a IExecutorService.

The result is that it is not currently possible to create beans of type IExecutorService (or other lib's classes that extend from ExecutorService).

Thanks!
