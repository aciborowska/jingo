`mn create-app --features tracing-zipkin appname` results in `compile "io.micronaut:tracing"` being added to the `build.gradle`.  The annotations (like `@NewSpan`) are in the `tracing` jar and must be on the compile time classpath in order to be referenced.  I think the dependency should be configured as a `compile` scoped dependency.
