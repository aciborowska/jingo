If you define an introspected Groovy bean such as:

```
class Person {
       final String name
}
```

The `final` modifier is ignored and the property is not treated as read only (`BeanProperty.isReadOnly` returns false) resulting in a `NoSuchMethodError` when attempting to set the property (which should never be settable)
