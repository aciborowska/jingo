In `2.0.0.RC2`.

The problem is widely described in #2140 and #2099. It was fixed in `1.2.3` but it seems it's now present again in `2.0.0.RC2`.

This is **not** a problem of having circular dependencies between beans, because it is not 100% reproducible, maybe 10% tops. This is some race condition during beans context initialization, which was previously fixed successfully for some time.

My example exception is [contained in this comment](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/issues/2140#issuecomment-650163797).
