The `isIterable` method is defined as:

```
    public boolean isIterable() {
        return classValue(EachProperty.class.getName()).isPresent() || definition.isIterable();
    }
```

The `@EachProperty` annotation does not support a class value so the usage of `classValue` makes no sense here. This probably should be `@EachBean` although I am not sure if this call is even necessary.
