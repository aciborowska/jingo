### Steps to Reproduce

Background: we have an application that implements a dummy login REST endpoint consuming APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED data. That endpoint is called repeatedly by a 3rd party component. After a week our application ran out of memory.

1. Create a Micronaut application having a Controller handling POST method consuming `MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED` without Body argument as follows:
```
    @Post(value = "/login", consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)
    HttpStatus dummyLogin() {
        log.info "login, no body"
        return HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN
    }
```
2. POST repeatedly to that endpoint.

### Expected Behaviour

Application will run normally for days to come.

### Actual Behaviour

Application will run out of memory within a week.

### Environment Information

- **Operating System:** macOS Mojave, 10.14.5. Docker Desktop 2.1.0.1 / Amazon Linux 2
- **Micronaut Version:** 1.2.0
- **JDK Version:** Openjdk 11.0.4 2019-07-16 LTS / runtime adoptopenjdk/openjdk11-openj9:jdk-11.0.1.13-alpine-slim
