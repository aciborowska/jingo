### Steps to Reproduce
Use this combination in your application.yml file:
```
micronaut.server.context-path=/abc
endpoints.all.path=/xyz
```

### Actual behavior:
Built-in endpoints like health would be then available at `/xyz/abc/health` which seems to be wrong.

### Expected behaviour:
Built-in endpoints should be available either at `/abc/xyz/...` path if we assume that context-path is shared also for endpoints OR, preferably at plain `/xyz/...` path - as these endpoints may be intentionally made to be out of the app context path - the same behavior as when `micronaut.router.static-resources.*.mapping` is used - it also doesn't take `context-path` into account.
