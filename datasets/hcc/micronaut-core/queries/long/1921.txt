I have the following configuration for a CircuitBreaker on a Client:

```
@Client("price")
@CircuitBreaker(
        includes = [HttpClientException::class],
        excludes = [HttpClientResponseException::class]
)
```
There are 2 issues here:

1. The retry mechanism is comparing against the wrong class in the excludes

When SimpleRetry.canRetry() executes the line `excludes.contains(exceptionClass)` it fails, as the class in the excludes list is an AnnotationClassValue, and not the one I configured.

2. The includes list is empty

I don't know why, but I can't get the includes list to contain any classes, despite being configured.


### Steps to Reproduce

Configure "includes" and "excludes" section of circuit breaker annotation on a client.
Create a request that causes such an exception
Watch SimpleRetry.canRetry() fail to match the exception with the configured one.

### Expected Behaviour

The exception should be matched against the given exclude list.

### Actual Behaviour

It doesn't, and carries on retrying

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: Mac
- **Micronaut Version:** 1.1.4
- **JDK Version:** 8+
