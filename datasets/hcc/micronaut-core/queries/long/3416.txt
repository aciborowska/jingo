DefaultHttpClientAddressResolver throws NullPointerException when requests comes from another Micronaut service. Only some requests fail, not all. Very strange.

### Steps to Reproduce

It's hard to reproduce, but this is how my setup looks like.

Inject a HttpClientAddressResolver into a service. Inject the service into a controller and call resolve(httpRequest). When requests originate from the browser (via nginx) it always succeeds. But some internal requests from one microservice to this service fails with NullPointerException in DefaultHttpClientAddressResolver. I assume getRemoteAddress() returns null https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/blob/master/http-server/src/main/java/io/micronaut/http/server/util/DefaultHttpClientAddressResolver.java#L55

I've not seen this problem when using docker-compose on my Mac but it happens in some situations in a kubernetes test environment on CentOS. It's one particular http request between two microservices, but I can't figure out the difference between other working services.

### Expected Behaviour

Client address should be resolved or null should be returned from the resolve method if the address could not be resolved.

### Actual Behaviour
```
java.lang.NullPointerException: null
	at io.micronaut.http.server.util.DefaultHttpClientAddressResolver.resolve(DefaultHttpClientAddressResolver.java:55)
```
