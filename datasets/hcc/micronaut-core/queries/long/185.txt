When Sending a StreamedFile response via a Micronaut Filter in rapid succession from a web browser using a keep-alive connection... Some requests hang for over a minute as it appears the request is not getting processed via the connection until a timeout or flush occurs.

### Expected Behaviour

Files should be served in sequence. Per @graemerocher this is probably due to the context of the connection not being switched from write mode to read mode after file is served. This may also be related to 304 response types as well.

### Actual Behaviour

Connection hangs for minutes at a time

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: N/A
- **Micronaut Version: 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT
- **JDK Version: N/A
