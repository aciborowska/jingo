The Http client metrics are reporting status of 500 when the declarative http client throws an exception. 

This is the result WebMetricsPublisher treating all exceptions as 500s and the declarative http client throwing exceptions based on unsuccessful response status codes.

This has been verified with micrometer prometheus provider.

### Task List

- [ ] Steps to reproduce provided
- [ ] Stacktrace (if present) provided
- [ ] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github
- [ ] Full description of the issue provided (see below)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Turn on metrics
2. Provide a declarative http client
3. Provide a controller to call the http client
4. Call the controller endpoint with a bad request that returns a 400 status code from the http client
5. Look at the http client request metrics to verify that the status code is 500 and not the expected 400

### Expected Behaviour

I expect that http client request metrics report the actual http status code. 

### Actual Behaviour

If an exception is thrown from the declarative http client because of the http status code then the report status code in the metrics is always 500.
