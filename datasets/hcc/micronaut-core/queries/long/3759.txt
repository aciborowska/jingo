### Task List

- [x] Steps to reproduce provided
- [ ] Stacktrace (if present) provided
- [ ] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github
- [x] Full description of the issue provided (see below)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a `ProxyHttpClient`
2. Call the `proxy` method on a URI with a `host()` value that is different from the originating service.
3. Note the `Host` header still references the originating service URI's `host()` value.
    - Known issues with Cloud Providers:
       - GCP AppEngine will not accept requests with a `Host` header different from the service being called.

### Expected Behaviour

The `proxy` method should rewrite the `Host` header to the `host()` value of the URI being called by `proxy()`.

### Actual Behaviour

The `Host` header of the request made by the `proxy` method is set to the `host()` value the originating service's URI.
