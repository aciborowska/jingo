### Steps to Reproduce

1. define a endpoint that accepts query parameters
2. add Swagger to the project
3. build the project to generate the open-api yaml documentation

### Expected Behaviour
The generated open-api yaml should be valid.

### Actual Behaviour
the "path" field corresponding to the endpoint with queryparameters is incorrect (it contains curlybrackets with the query parameters)

the "in" field under each parameter has the value "path" instead of "query".
