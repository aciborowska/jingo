When return type is Flowable generated response contains duplicate 'transfer-encoding' header with value 'chunked'

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a standard controller with the method:
```
@Get("/checkDuplicateHeaders")
    fun checkDuplicateHeaders(): Flowable<String> {
        return Flowable.just("Hello World")
    }
```

2. Call the method using curl:
`curl -v "http://localhost:8010/v3/checkDuplicateHeaders"`

3. Response has two 'transfer-encoding' headers
```
*   Trying ::1:8010...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8010 (#0)
> GET /v3/checkDuplicateHeaders HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8010
> User-Agent: curl/7.65.1
> Accept: */*
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< transfer-encoding: chunked
< Date: Thu, 5 Mar 2020 09:42:00 GMT
< transfer-encoding: chunked
< content-type: application/json
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
[Hello World]%
```

There should be only one 'transfer-encoding' header in response
