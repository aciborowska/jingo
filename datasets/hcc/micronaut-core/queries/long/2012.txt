A while back you had fixed and added support for using something like this in code

```groovy
ApplicationContext context = ApplicationContext.run(MapPropertySource.of(
                "test",
                ["server.uri.pattern"  : ["/secured/**", "/secret/**"]]
        ), "test")
...
```

```java
@Slf4j
@Filter("${server.uri.pattern:/**}")
public class ServerFilter {
...
}
```

Where we could provide a `list` via props to the @Filter and it would correctly work.

**Working**
1.1.0
1.1.1
1.1.2

**Broken**
1.1.3
1.1.4
1.2.0

Something between 1.1.2->1.1.3 broke this.  I am still digging as to why this broke.
