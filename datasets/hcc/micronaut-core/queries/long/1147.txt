### Task List

- [x] Steps to reproduce provided
- [ ] Stacktrace (if present) provided
- [ ] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github
- [x] Full description of the issue provided (see below)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Use the mn command to create a new federation for maven build: `mn create-federation my-federation --services=service1 --build=maven`.
2. Use Maven to build the resulting code: `mvn clean install`

### Expected Behaviour

Maven should successfully build the project, including all services.

### Actual Behaviour

Maven gives following error:
```

Fixing that error and trying again gives another error:
```

The following lines missing from the root pom.xml:
```
  <groupId>groupid</groupId>
  <artifactId>artifactid</artifactId>
  <version>0.1</version>
  <packaging>pom</packaging>
```

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: Mac OS
- **Micronaut Version:** 1.0.3
- **JDK Version:** 8.0_181

Additional ask: Can we make the groupId in all the POMs be the name of the federation, and the artifactIds be the names of the services or name of federation (top-level)?
