### Steps to Reproduce

Create a simple client
```java
@Client("/")
public interface MyClient {
    @Get("/call{?obj*}")
    String call(@Nullable Pojo obj);
}
```
And send a request.
Method `call` produces the following request:
```
TRACE i.m.http.client.DefaultHttpClient - HTTP Client Response Received for Request: GET http://localhost:26582/call?
```

### Expected Behaviour

Method `call` sends a request with pojo properties as query arguments.

### Actual Behaviour

Method `call` sends a request without arguments.
