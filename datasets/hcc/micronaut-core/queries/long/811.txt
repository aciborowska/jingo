Hi,

I was playing with the Eureka and Zipkin examples from your website and noticed a problem when Eureka and Zipkin are configured together. I was playing with the Eureka tutorial and got it to work without any problem. I then looked at the Zipkin example, cloned the repo, executed it and I could see my requests in Zipkin and life was good. When I added the Eureka stuff to the Zipkin example I could see the services in Eureka, but when I send requests I always get 404 and nothing in Zipkin. I added a breakpoint to the constructor on one of the controller and it is not triggered at startup or when I send a request so it's no registered inside the application. I created a sample application here:

### Expected Behaviour

Expected the service to register into Eureka, serve requests and see the request traces in Zipkin.

### Actual Behaviour

When Eureka and Zipkin are configured together something prevents the controllers to be registered in the Micronaut application. When a request is sent a 404 is returned. There's no stackstrace at startup even if the controllers are not registered.

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: Tried Windows 10 and Windows 10 embedded Ubuntu
- **Micronaut Version:** 1.0.0 (from sdkman)
- **JDK Version:** 1.8.0_181

### Example Application

## Steps to reproduce incompatibility:
1. docker run -p 9001:8761 springcloud/eureka
2. docker run -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
3. ./gradlew run
4. curl http://localhost:8080/books

### Result:
{"_links":{"self":{"href":"/books","templated":false}},"message":"Page Not Found"}

## Eureka works without Zipkin:

1. git checkout eureka-working
2. ./gradlew run
3. curl http://localhost:8080/books

### Result:
[{"isbn":"1491950358","name":"Building Microservices"},{"isbn":"1680502395","name":"Release It!"},{"isbn":"0321601912","name":"Continuous Delivery:"}]


## Zipkin works without Eureka:

1. git checkout zipkin-working
2. ./gradlew run
3. curl http://localhost:8080/books

### Result:
[{"isbn":"1491950358","name":"Building Microservices"},{"isbn":"1680502395","name":"Release It!"},{"isbn":"0321601912","name":"Continuous Delivery:"}]

You can also look at Zipkin to see that the request passed.
