Using the mn cli I'm unable to create a federation of services with the build tool set to maven.
Secondary, I'm unable to create a federation of services outside the mn cli unless adding something like `--verbose before the federation name.`

### Task List

- [x] Steps to reproduce provided
- [X] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github
- [X] Full description of the issue provided (see below)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a folder federation
2. Open mn cli inside federation folder
3. Run Command `create-federation --build=maven --services=app1,app2,app3,app4 --inplace` inside folder
4. Check generated files.

Also tried:
1. Run Command `mn create-federation --build=maven --services=app1,app2,app3,app4 federation` <- This fails with `Specify an application name or use --inplace ....` error
Running the same command with `--verbose` after the list of services fixes the error.
 

### Expected Behaviour
A federation of services with build tool maven is generated

### Actual Behaviour
A federation of services with build tool gradle is generated
