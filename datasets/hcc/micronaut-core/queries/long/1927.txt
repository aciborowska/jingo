Almost the same as #1097. Now, two beans of the same class with different names work well:

```java
@Factory
public class MyBeanFactory {

	@Bean @Named("bean1")
	public IMyBean bean1() {
		return new MyBean();
	}

	@Bean @Named("bean2")
	public IMyBean bean2() {
		return new MyBean();
	}

}
```

However, according to [the docs](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#aroundAdvice) (*AOP Advice on @Factory Beans* chapter) the beans created by the factory can be wrapped with Around Advice. For example `@Validated`:

```java
@Factory
public class MyBeanFactory {

	@Bean @Named("bean1") @Validated
	public IMyBean bean1() {
		return new MyBean();
	}

	@Bean @Named("bean2") @Validated
	public IMyBean bean2() {
		return new MyBean();
	}

}
```

With the above factory injection ends up with `NonUniqueBeanException`.
