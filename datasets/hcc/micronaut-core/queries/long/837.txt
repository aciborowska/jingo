Issue raised in Micronaut Gitter, advised to raise an issue here by @jameskleeh. @Nullable for a @QueryValue can only be specified directly on the Controller, but not on an interface that the Controller implements.

### Task List

- [Y] Steps to reproduce provided
- [Y] Stacktrace (if present) provided (HTTP Error Response)
- [Y] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github
- [Y] Full description of the issue provided (see below)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create an interface called 'TestAPI' with one @Get method 'test', that takes a @QueryValue String testParam parameter that is @Nullable
2. Implement the only 'TestAPI' method with a @Controller 'TestController'
3. Call the TestController without the @Nullable testParam specified in the URL.

### Expected Behaviour

I would expect that the @Nullable @QueryValue String testParam is optional, as it was defined as such in the TestAPI interface

### Actual Behaviour

An error is provided in the response, saying that testParam is required:

```
{
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "/testApi/test",
            "templated": false
        }
    },
    "message": "Required argument [String testParam] not specified",
    "path": "/testParam"
}
```

I tested @Nullable directly on the controller, and it does indeed make the testParam optional. Problem only occurs with interface.
