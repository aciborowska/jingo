We are still experiencing weird tracing behavior, even after the fix for #2051. This time the issue is 100% reproducible inside a test (provided in the example application repository). 

The problem probably has to do with threading / reactive things inside micronaut. I've made a second test that has the same steps, but the `/ping` controller is made reactive - the issue is not present there. 

### Task List

- [x] Steps to reproduce provided
- [ ] Stacktrace (if present) provided
- [x] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github
- [x] Full description of the issue provided (see below)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a simple controller (in our example, `/ping`)
2. Enable `/health` endpoint
3. Call `/health` endpoint
4. Call `/ping` endpoint

### Expected Behaviour

Two separate spans, unrelated to each other

### Actual Behaviour

Two spans. `/ping` is a child_of `/health`.

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: Windows and Linux
- **Micronaut Version:** 1.2.2
- **JDK Version:** 8

### Example Application
