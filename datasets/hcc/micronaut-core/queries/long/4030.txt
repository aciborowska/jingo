In `2.0.1`.

Micronaut's `DefaultValidator` is not compatible with Hibernate `BeanValidationEventListener`, because produced `ConstraintViolation`-s frequently contains null `leafBean` and [this line](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/master/hibernate-core/src/main/java/org/hibernate/cfg/beanvalidation/BeanValidationEventListener.java#L124) crashes with NPE. Please note, that I don't use Hibernate Validator, only Hibernate with Micronaut validator.

Looking at `DefaultValidator` and spots where it produces `DefaultConstraintViolation`, there are three cases where `leafBean` is `null`, and only one where is not. For example if you define your own validator with `@Validation` annotation to be used directly on entity class:

```
@Validation class MyEntity {}
```

This will crash with NPE from within Hibernate. This scenario is documented on `ConstraintViolation.getLeafBean()`: *Returns the bean instance the constraint is applied on if it is a bean constraint*. So, at least this kind of produced `ConstraintViolation` is wrong, and in this scenario `leafBean` should be set to `rootBean`, but there're two other usages of `DefaultConstraintViolation` constructor where `leafBean` is also `null`, which should be reviewed separately.
