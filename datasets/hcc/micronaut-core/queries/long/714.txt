Hello,

I experienced "page not found" problems when I launch the HelloWorld application within Eclipse GUI (whereas with gradle command line everything works fine). Using these tutorials : 
http://guides.micronaut.io/creating-your-first-micronaut-app/guide/index.html
https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#creatingClient

In order to work within Eclipse GUI I had to remove the 'shadow' gradle plugin from the build.gradle.
And I had to add the "/" path in the @Get annotation value attribute of the HelloClient hello method.


### Task List

- [x] Steps to reproduce provided
- [] Stacktrace (if present) provided
- [] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github
- [x] Full description of the issue provided (see below)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. mn create-app com-demo-app --build gradle --features java,junit
2. follow the tutorial : http://guides.micronaut.io/creating-your-first-micronaut-app/guide/index.html
3. run the test with Eclipse GUI, by right clicking on the HelloControllerTest.java and choosing "Run as -> Junit Test". => fail (maybe shadow gradle plugin)
4. follow the tutorial to create a client : https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#creatingClient
5. run the application by right clicking on the Application.java and choosing "Run as -> Java application".
6. open a web browser (or use curl) and put http://localhost:8080/hello/ => "page not found" (maybe shadow gradle plugin and 'missing' "/" path in @Get HelloClient method annotation.)

### Expected Behaviour
Tests should have succeed.
'Hello world' should have been printed on the web browser.

### Actual Behaviour
Running JUnit test within Eclipse fails.
Calling the service within web browser indicates : "page not found".
