Since `1.2.x`/`1.3.0.M1` --> `1.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` something changed regarding AOP in Micronaut when using Kotlin as language.

When updating the dependency from `1.3.0.M1` to `1.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` I suddenly get `Method defines AOP advice but is declared final. Change the method to be non-final in order for AOP advice to be applied.` errors I didn't get before.

Below an example of affected code:

```
abstract class BaseRepositoryImpl(
    val context: DSLContext
)

@Singleton
lass CountryRepositoryImpl(
    context: DSLContext,
) : BaseRepositoryImpl(context), CountryRepository {
    ..
}
```

I had to change the `context` var in the `BaseRepositoryImpl` to `open`:

```
abstract class BaseRepositoryImpl(
    open val context: DSLContext
)
```
