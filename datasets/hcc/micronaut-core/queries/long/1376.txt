It goes against common best practices but throwing an exception in a constructor in certain scenarios causes a Micronaut controller to go into a loop 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a Controller
2. Add a Mapping Method
3. Add an `@Error` Method to the same controller
4. Inject another service that throws an exception in it's constructor
5. Try to call mapping method

### Expected Behaviour

Shutdown  or return a 500 Error

### Actual Behaviour

The client call to the controller just times out

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: Linux arch 4.20.12-arch1-1-ARCH
- **Micronaut Version:** 1.0.4
- **JDK Version:** graal 1.0.0_rc13-1 (Java 8 192?)
