### Steps to Reproduce

1. Write an ExceptionHandler that handles Exception.class
2. Create an error in controller that returns a Maybe 
3. Sometimes see the handler kick in (requires JVM restart if it doesn't handle it)

### Expected Behaviour

A generic Exception should be handled by the ExceptionHandler consistently

### Actual Behaviour

Sometimes does, sometimes doesn't. Non deterministic. Have to restart JVM to fix, and doesn't always. We see this in K8S environments with multiple pods, some pods work, some don't.

### Environment Information
