If I modify the controller again, then it works:
```

### Example Application

This is the controller I'm using:

import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Produces;

@Controller("/")
public class HelloController {

    @Produces(value = MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    @Get("/hello")
    public String sayHi() {
        return "Hello world";
    }
}
```
