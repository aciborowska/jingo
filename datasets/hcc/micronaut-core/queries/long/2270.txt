The main problem I see in HttpClientIntroductionAdvice#getClient, a new client is created but only annotation's `path` value is taken, even so existing `HttpClient` has the correct path value.

In debugger I can see that `beanContext.findBean(HttpClient.class, Qualifiers.byName(NameUtils.hyphenate(clientId))` always creates a new instance so in the end there are going to be two instances per service.

Also, ServiceHttpClientFactory implements a health check and with the current implementation the default Jackson configuration is going to be used.
