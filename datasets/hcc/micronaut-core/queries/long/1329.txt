- [x] Steps to reproduce provided
- [x] Stacktrace (if present) provided
- [x] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github
- [x] Full description of the issue provided (see below)

### Steps to Reproduce

Enable client connection pooling, pool size 1
Set server idle-timeout shorter than client read-timeout
Make one request to an endpoint that use a client which responds slower than the idle-timeout
Make another request to the same endpoint

### Expected Behaviour

The second request should be able to checkout a connection from the pool
Connections should always be returned to the pool

### Actual Behaviour

Client connections that takes longer to return than the server idle-timeout are never returned to the pool
