Hi, I'm trying to create a simple application with Java 11 and modules (module-info.java present). I'm having a hard time getting things to compile, as soon as I add:     

```
annotationProcessor(platform("io.micronaut:micronaut-bom:$micronautVersion"))
annotationProcessor("io.micronaut:micronaut-inject-java")
```

to my gradle project, then the build fails with:

```
> Task :app.runner:compileJava FAILED                              
                                                                   
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.                           
                                                                   
* What went wrong:                                                 
Execution failed for task ':app.runner:compileJava'.               
> java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unexpected element app.runner
```

The environment is Java 11, Gradle 5.6.2 and Micronaut 1.2.3. The --stacktrace and --debug options does not tell me anything useful.

The module is named "app.runner" - and if I change the module name, the error changes accordingly. If I add the lombok annotation processor instead, the build also seems to work.

I asked on Gitter and Graeme Rocher pointed me to a working project (https://github.com/weiqigao/micronaut-test-modules-issue).

That sample project is running on my system after adding a gradle 5.6.2 wrapper and still using Java 11. 
However when I bump the micronaut version in the sample project from 1.1.0 to 1.2.3 the compileJava task fails again with the same "unexpected element <module-name>" error as I see in my project.
