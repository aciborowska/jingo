1.3.4 Throws an exception when default `@Client` method is called. I can see it has an abstract field set as true.
```
o.micronaut.aop.exceptions.UnimplementedAdviceException: All possible Introduction advise exhausted and no implementation found for method: Maybe myMethod(String xyz)
	at io.micronaut.aop.chain.MethodInterceptorChain.proceed(MethodInterceptorChain.java:58)
```

Method is calling other client methods and is using `@Cacheable`
