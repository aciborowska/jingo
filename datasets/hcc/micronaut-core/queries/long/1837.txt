Here is the log:
```
2019-06-27 15:11:52.640 DEBUG 45785 [           main] i.m.c.e.AbstractPropertySourceLoader     : No PropertySource found for file name: application.yml
2019-06-27 15:11:52.641 DEBUG 45785 [           main] i.m.c.e.AbstractPropertySourceLoader     : No PropertySource found for file name: application.yml.yaml
```

I guess AbstractPropertySourceLoader is broken now as it's trying to load `application.yml.yaml` instead of `application.yaml`
