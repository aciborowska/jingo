When displaying page that renders a handlebars view from a .jar file, the view is not found (404).  This is probably only a problem when the app is run on a Windows platform.

This issue is similar to one found with Thymeleaf: [753](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/issues/753)

Pull request [859](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/pull/859)  submitted.
