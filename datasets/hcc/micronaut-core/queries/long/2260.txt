### Steps to Reproduce

1. set your jdk to `8.0.222.j9-adpt`. You can do this easily via sdkman via
 `$ sdk use java  8.0.222.j9-adpt`
2. set your micronaut version to 1.2.5
  `$ sdk use micronaut 1.2.5`
3. attempt to create an app using the micronaut cli tool
  `$ mn create-app foo`

### Expected Behaviour

A micronaut app should be created

### Actual Behaviour

An error occurs, seems to be with the JVM args the cli tool utilizes

```
JVMJ9VM007E Command-line option unrecognised: --add-opens=java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
```

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: Linux Mint 19
- **Micronaut Version:** 1.2.5
- **JDK Version:**  8.0.222.j9-adpt (might be true of a variety of j9 JDKs?)

Perhaps also of note, this is using `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh`, not bash.
