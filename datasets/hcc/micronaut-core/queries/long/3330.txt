### Steps to Reproduce

1. Try to create a templated Link with a [Form-Style Query Expansion](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570#section-3.2.8) component.

### Expected Behaviour

The Link can be created.

### Actual Behaviour

The Link cannot be created because the `build()` method accepts only a URI, which cannot contain all characters supported by URI Templates. For example, `URI.create("https://example.com/test{?param}")` results in `java.net.URISyntaxException: Illegal character in path at index 24: https://example.com/test{?param}`.

Even if `build()` were overloaded with a String version, `DefaultLink.href` is defined as a URI, so it would also have to be changed. I'm not sure whether this would be a publicly visible change, which could be backward incompatible.

### Environment Information

- **Micronaut Version:** 1.3.5
- **JDK Version:** 11.0.7

### Example

```
