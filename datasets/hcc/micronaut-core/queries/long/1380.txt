If you create a common base class that implements `ExceptionHandler` and you derive exception handler beans from it the wrong handler can be invoked for an exception.

Example app with repo steps:
https://github.com/boris317/micronaut-exception-handler-bug

The issue probably resides around `populateTypeArguments` on `BeanDefinitionInjectProcessor`.  The wrong type arguments are populated. For example the the `T extends Throwable` type argument on `ExceptionHandler` is populated as just `Throwable` causing all of the derived exception handles to be candidates to match any exception.
