### Steps to Reproduce

1. mvn clean install
2. mvn clean compile package

Runnable micronaut runnable jar at cli

### Actual Behaviour

mvn clean install
mvn clean compile package issues ERROR where micronaut picocli jar 1.2.1 references micronaut dependencies such as AOP, INJECT, HTTP and RUNTIME versions 1.1.4
I have to use company local maven repo which only has the latest version for all micronaut dependencies at: 1.2.5
Why does the micronaut picocli jar reference older version of micronaut?
Please advise.
