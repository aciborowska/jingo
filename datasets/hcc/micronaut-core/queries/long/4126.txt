[This line](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/blob/master/http/src/main/java/io/micronaut/http/simple/SimpleHttpHeaders.java#L90) is **setting** the header instead of **adding** a new header value. The entire implementation looks wrong as well, because Http headers can accept multi values..

I have found it by chance while running unit tests in a project without `micronaut-http-server-netty`. If netty project is added, calls to `io.micronaut.http.HttpResponse.ok()` would return a netty implementation at low level that doesn`t have the bug.
