Consider following test snippet
```java
@MicronautTest
public class TestClientConfigurationInterferenceInjection {

    @Inject
    @Client(value = "/", configuration = TestNoFollowRedirectClientConfig.class)
    RxHttpClient clientNoFollow;

    /**
     * Should use {@link DefaultHttpClientConfiguration}.
     */
    @Inject
    @Client(value = "/")
    RxHttpClient clientFollow;
}
```
In this case, both clients are the same instance and share the same configuration even though each was declared to use different configuration.
