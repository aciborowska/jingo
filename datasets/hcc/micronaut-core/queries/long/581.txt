I found a problem with annotations in @Client methods. The @Body annotation must be on the last parameter otherwise all other parameter annotations are ignored. The following line works, the authorization header is set in the request:
```
Single<Book> saveBook(@Header String authorization, @Body Book book);
```
but this will not work, the Header annotation is not processed:
```
Single<Book> saveBook(@Body Book book, @Header String authorization);
```
It's because of a break statement in HttpClientIntroductionAdvice

### Steps to Reproduce

Create a @Client with a method that is annotated with @Body. Make sure the body annotation is NOT the last method parameter. If it is last it will work.
```
Single<Book> saveBook(@Body Book book, @Header String authorization);
```

### Expected Behaviour

The authorization header should be sent with the request.

### Actual Behaviour

The client will not send the authorization header.
