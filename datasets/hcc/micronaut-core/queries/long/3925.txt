After creating a brand new project with the management feature, we noticed that the /loggers endpoint was enabled, even though https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#loggersEndpoint says:

The loggers endpoint is disabled by default and needs to be explicitly enabled with the setting endpoints.loggers.enabled=true.
