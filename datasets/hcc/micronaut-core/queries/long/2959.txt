Regression in `2.0.0.M1`.

In `1.3` I was able to create custom `@Client` annotation which could have predefined some settings which I didn't have to repeat on all of my clients. For example:

```java
@Documented
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.FIELD})
@Client
@CircuitBreaker(/* some setup*/)
public @interface SafeClient {
  // ...
}
```
In `2.0.0.M1` it's not possible due to this unreasonable restriction:

```java
public class HttpClientIntroductionAdvice implements MethodInterceptor<Object, Object> {

	@Override
	public Object intercept(MethodInvocationContext<Object, Object> context) {
		if (!context.hasAnnotation(Client.class)) {
			throw new IllegalStateException("Client advice called from type that is not annotated with @Client: " + context);
		}
```

I find it unreasonable because after removing it completely, or changing to `context.findAnnotation()` everything works as previously.
