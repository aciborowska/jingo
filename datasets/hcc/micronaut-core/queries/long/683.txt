A request engaging multiple services is only able to resolve the original request in the call to the first collaborator. 

Relates to: https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/issues/659

### Steps to Reproduce

- 1. Clone branch issue-659-multiple-requests
- 2. Execute test `io.micronaut.security.token.propagation.TokenPropagationSpec`test fails. 
- 3. Place a breakpoint in `io.micronaut.security.token.propagation.TokenPropagationHttpClientFilter` Line [76](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/blob/issue-659-multiple-requests/security/src/main/java/io/micronaut/security/token/propagation/TokenPropagationHttpClientFilter.java#L76). You will see that current is not empty when calling the first collaborator but empty for the other two requests.
