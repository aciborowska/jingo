Methods that return reactive types and are wrapped with @Cacheable annotation are timing out.

### Task List

- [ X] Steps to reproduce provided
- [ X] Stacktrace (if present) provided
- [ X] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github
- [X ] Full description of the issue provided (see below)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a @Client that returns a Single
2. Configure caching and annotate with @Cacheable
3. Use this client in a controller and the response will timeout. (Without the @Cacheable annotation it works as expected)

### Expected Behaviour

Able to cache responses from declarative http clients with reactive types.

### Actual Behaviour

Methods wrapped with @Cacheable annotation that return reactive types eventually timeout.

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: MacOS
- **Micronaut Version:** 1.0.1
- **JDK Version:** 1.8.0_152
