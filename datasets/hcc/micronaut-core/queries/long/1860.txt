Currently Micronaut generates beans for classes that have a single `@PostConstruct` definition and not declared as beans with either `@Singleton` or one of the available scopes. This is a bug and should not occur.

This relates to #1859 however is more of a bug in the current implementation IMO as the lifecycle methods don't indicate that injection is wanted so the behaviour is very surprising.

This is the root cause of https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues/11351

### Steps to Reproduce

Define:

```java
package test;

import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;

class Test {

    @PostConstruct
    void init() {
    }
}
```

### Expected Behaviour

No bean definition is created

### Actual Behaviour

A bean definition is created
