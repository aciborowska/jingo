It sounds strange, but when I copy source code from the documentation and paste it into my IDE I get error messages.

For example, when I click on 'Copy to Clipboard' at https://docs.micronaut.io/1.3.0.M1/guide/index.html#_scheduling_at_a_fixed_rate and paste, I get an error message in IntelliJ and with Gradle-Build the following error message:

'unexpected token: â€‹ @'

If I delete a hidden character before 'void' everythings works fine.

I know that is a strange issue. But for beginners it can be very confusing.
