### Steps to Reproduce

mn create-federation fed --features aws-api-gateway,security-jwt,file-watch --services picard,kirk

### Expected Behaviour

I believe the expected behavior is a root directory called 'fed' with two subprojects: 'picard' and 'kirk'. Each subproject should include a sam.yaml file generated by the aws-api-gateway feature and should include file watch and jwt config in application.yml.

### Actual Behaviour

Sam.yml and config in application.yml was only included in one of the projects. However, it appears as if both build.gradle files in the subprojects have the same dependencies.

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: macOS Mojave 10.14.4
- **Micronaut Version:** 1.1.0
- **JDK Version:** 1.8.0_201
