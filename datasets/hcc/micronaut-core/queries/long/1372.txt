Hi!

I've experienced a very weird bug - after creating a shadowJar with "com.github.johnrengelman.shadow" plugin and running it - some static content is not loaded on the first web page load.
After 1 (sometimes 2) page refresh, they all finally get loaded. I can see some exceptions in the server logs. It happens both on MacOS and Windows.

Here is a screenshot from *Chrome dev tools - Network with 500 error* :

This is the *stack trace*:
[stacktrace.log](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/files/2963852/stacktrace.log)


And this is router config that I have:

```
micronaut:
  router:
    static-resources:
      webjars:
        enabled: true
        paths: classpath:META-INF/resources/webjars
        mapping: /webjars/**
      public:
        enabled: true
        paths: classpath:public
        mapping: /public/**
```

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Package application as uberJar.
2. Run uberJar.
3. Open web application in browser.

### Expected Behaviour

Static content is not loaded on the first page load.

### Actual Behaviour

Static content is not loaded on the first page load.

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: MacOS / Windows 7/10
- **Micronaut Version:** 1.1.0.M2
- **JDK Version:** 1.8.0_192
