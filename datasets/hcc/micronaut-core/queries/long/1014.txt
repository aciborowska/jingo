- [x] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github
- [x] Full description of the issue provided (see below)

### Steps to Reproduce

Create a gorm Entity which uses auto timestamps e.g.


    @Entity
    @Canonical
    class MyEntity {
        static mapping = {
            autoTimestamp true
        }
    
        String name
        Date dateCreated
        Date lastUpdated
    }

    Write code which persists the entity:

    new MyEntity(name: "foo").save(flush: true)

### Expected Behaviour

GORM should automatically manage the `createdDate` and `lastUpdated` properties.

Tell us what should happen

### Actual Behaviour

GORM doesn't the `createdDate` and `lastUpdated` properties. If validation is configured validation fails the insert as the properties are still null at the point of insert.

### Environment Information
