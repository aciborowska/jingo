### Description
When fetching static resources, like for example an image the http response header contains both the `Content-Length` and `transfer-encoding: chunked`. According to the http spec this should not happen https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2

Some services like Varnish, will not cache these objects

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Add an image to resources folder
2. Fetch it and check the headers

### Expected Behaviour

Content-Length header should not be there 

### Actual Behaviour

Both `Content-Length` and `transfer-encoding: chunked` is in the headers.

Tested with Micronaut 1.1.0 RC2
