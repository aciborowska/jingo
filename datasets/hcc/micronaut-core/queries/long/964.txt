Hi, thanks for a great product.
I'm scheduling rx hooks for MDC propagation for both Rx1 and Rx2. For Rx1 it doesnt work.

Micronaut 1.0.1
Rx1 1.3.8
Rx2 2.2.2

It shows the same behaviour whether tracing is enabled or not.

Code: 
```
        RxJavaHooks.setOnScheduleAction(new Rx1MdcPropagatingOnScheduleAction());
        RxJavaPlugins.setScheduleHandler(new Rx2MdcPropagatingOnScheduleFunction());
        ...
        Micronaut.run();
```
The `Action0.call` in the returned `Action0` from `Rx1MdcPropagatingOnScheduleAction.call` is not executed on scheduling of tasks in Rx1.
I have verified that hooks for Rx1 are executed in Rx1 code that run _before_ `Micronaut.run()`.
