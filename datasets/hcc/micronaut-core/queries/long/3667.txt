We have tried to upgrade our service to Micronaut 2.0 and found a strange bug with metrics.
we are using kotlin coroutine dispatcher for custom thread pool. Metrics were not being updated with the right status code when an exception is thrown after the upgrade.

### Task List

- [ ] Steps to reproduce provided
- [ ] Stacktrace (if present) provided
- [ ] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github
- [ ] Full description of the issue provided (see below)

### Steps to Reproduce

I have created a sample project (https://gitlab.com/anilkd/micronaut-kotlin-sample) to demonstrate the issue.
Sample projects contain 3 endpoints
1. /products/executor{?productId}
returns expected status, message when an exception is thrown and metric `http.server.requests` is updated with right status code
2. /products/scope{?productId}
returns expected status, message when an exception is thrown and metric `http.server.requests` is updated with right status code
3. /products/dispatcher{?productId}
returns expected status, message when an exception is thrown but metric `http.server.requests` is updated with status code 200 rather than 400, This was working fine in previous version of Micronaut 1.3.6

### Expected Behaviour

Metric `http.server.requests` should be updated with the right status code when an exception is thrown

### Actual Behaviour
Metric `http.server.requests` is updated with 200 status code when an exception is thrown
Tell us what happens instead

### Environment Information

- **Operating System**: Mac
- **Micronaut Version:** 2.0.0
- **JDK Version:** 11
