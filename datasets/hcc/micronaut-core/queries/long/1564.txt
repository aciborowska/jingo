In 1.1.0. For this class `@PostConstruct` is never called:

```java
@Transactional @Singleton
public class CategoryService {

	@PostConstruct
	protected void init11() {
		System.out.println("initialing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!");
	}

}
```

However, when I remove `@Transactional` it is called properly.
