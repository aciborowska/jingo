Related to #1865, there is an issue with the `refresh()` method (or more concretely, `stop()`), and is that it clears the catalog, but not the property source list. Therefore, when the environment is `start()`ted, the catalog is build from the old list of property sources.

This becomes an issue with distributed configuration clients with the ability to remove property sources (eg: Kubernetes).
