### Steps to Reproduce

[demo.tar.gz](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/files/4626697/demo.tar.gz)
1. open skeleton demo app 
2. build and run

Error is:
Internal Server Error: Failed to inject value for parameter [interceptors] of class: com.example.JsonTestFilter\n\nMessage: Circular dependency detected\nPath Taken: \nTestController.setClient([JsonTestClient client]) --> new JsonTestClient$Intercepted(BeanContext beanContext,Qualifier qualifier,[Interceptor[] interceptors]) --> new HttpClientIntroductionAdvice(BeanContext beanContext,[RxHttpClientRegistry clientFactory],JsonMediaTypeCodec jsonMediaTypeCodec,List transformers) --> new RxNettyHttpClientRegistry(HttpClientConfiguration defaultHttpClientConfiguration,[HttpClientFilterResolver httpClientFilterResolver],LoadBalancerResolver loadBalancerResolver,NettyClientSslBuilder nettyClientSslBuilder,ThreadFactory threadFactory,MediaTypeCodecRegistry codecRegistry,EventLoopGroupRegistry eventLoopGroupRegistry,EventLoopGroupFactory eventLoopGroupFactory,BeanContext beanContext) --> new DefaultHttpClientFilterResolver(AnnotationMetadataResolver annotationMetadataResolver,[List clientFilters]) --> JsonTestFilter.setClient([JsonTestClient client]


### Expected Behaviour

From gitter:
Upgraded a small micronaut-app from 1.3.5 to 2.0.0.M3 yesterday and since then hit by a problem I'm not sure how to solve.
Trouble is i now getting a io.micronaut.context.exceptions.CircularDependencyException: Failed to inject value for parameter [interceptors]
because I need to inject a @Client into an HttpClientFilter.... Reason is that I have the need to add a session header and therefore inject the singleton session manager bean into the HttpClientFilter and of course also need to connect to the host to establish the connection, yet I have the @Clientin the session manager bean and our circle is here...
In Micronaut 1.3.5 this was working without problem and I never noticed any trouble, with 2.0.0.M3 I have no idea how to use a HttpClientFilter in case one needs to get SessionDetails from a Client that gets filtered ....

PS: the login-url call is not reacted on by an if statement in the doFilter if that matters
