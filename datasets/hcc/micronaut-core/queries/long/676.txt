The `inject-groovy` implementation is sometimes initialising SLF4J with the message:

```
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
```

During compilation. 

### Steps to Reproduce

It is happening when compiling our own tests.

### Expected Behaviour

SL4J should not be initialised during compilation

### Actual Behaviour

SL4J is initialised during compilation
