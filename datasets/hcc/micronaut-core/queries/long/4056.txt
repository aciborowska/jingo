We have an application where we are using shutdown tasks(with some logs) in @PreDestroy and with cntl+c, we don't see any logs of shutdown logic getting printed.

We have observed the same issue with the "docker stop <container-id>" command.

Sample Application:
https://github.com/Sai-Bhargavi/SampleApp

Steps to Reproduce:
Start the application using ./gradlew run
When the application is up and running do "cntl+c"

Expected Behavior :
cntl+c does a graceful shutdown, thereby we should be able to see the logs of shutdown logic in @PreDestroy

Actual Behavior :
With cntl+c, it is directly exiting the terminal, thereby we are unable to see the logs of shutdown logic.

We have tried the following commands:
kill --INT <process-id>
kill --TERM <process-id>
and in both cases, we are able to see the logs of shutdown logic(which is written under @PreDestroy)
