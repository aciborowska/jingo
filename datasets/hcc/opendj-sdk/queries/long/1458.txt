With the default password policy configured to use the error log account status notification handler, I used manage-account to lock and unlock an account. I then used the control panel to administratively reset the account's password.

In no cases did I get any account status notifications in the error log. I can see an enabledStateChanged flag but it never gets set to reflect the changes to the entry, so the account status notification coder never gets run.
