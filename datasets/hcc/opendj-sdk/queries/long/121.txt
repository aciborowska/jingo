Steps to reproduce:

1) setup two OpenDJ instances, M1 and M2, with M1 containing 2000 example entries, and M2 empty
2) enable + initialize replication between the two
3) verify everything is ok
4) stop M2
5) start M2
6) goto step 4

This may require a couple of restarts to reproduce the problem but I regularly see 1, 2, or all 3 replication domains (cn=schema, cn=admin data, and dc=example,dc=com) fail on start up due to a generation ID of -1:

[18/Apr/2011:18:03:34 +0200] category=SYNC severity=SEVERE_WARNING msgID=14811213 msg=Replication server RS(7431) at localhost.localdomain/127.0.0.1:44485 presented generation ID -1 for domain "cn=schema", but the generation ID of this replication server RS(15882) is 8408. This usually indicates that one or more directory servers in the replication topology have not been initialized with the same data, and re-initialization is required

This usually indicates that one or more directory servers in the replication topology have not been initialized with the same data, and re-initialization is required

This is probably a race condition at startup because the number of domains impacted seems to vary and, later review of the cn=monitor stats indicates that all DS/RS have the correct generation ID.
