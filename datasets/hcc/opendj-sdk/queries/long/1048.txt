After OpenDJ installation with the QuickSetup (jnlp), the "licenseAccepted" file is not created in the correct folder.

For instance if you install OpenDJ under "/home/$USER/opendj", the "licenseAccepted" will be created under "/home/$USER/Legal/licenseAccepted".

Workaround on Linux:
Move the "Legal/licenseAccepted" to "<opendj>/Legal" folder
