At the moment, commons configuration expression such as --set am-cts/amCtsAdminPassword:&{file:/path/to/password_file.txt} can be used as profile parameter value.

This was motivated by the fact that providing a clear text password on the command line could led to have password visible from a ps command output. Also, the idea was to make the setup tool more devops friendly by allowing a user to not use static values in commands:

$ ./setup [...] --profile proxy-server --set proxy-user-dn:&{ds.proxy-user.dn} --set proxy-user-password :&{file:/path/to/password.txt} [...]



As Matthew Swift noticed, the real way to make the tool more devops friendly is to allow user to build configuration template from the setup tool by allowing the tool to set expression in configuration (for example let the proxy-server profile set &{ds.proxy-user.dn} in proxy backend's proxy-user-dn property.

Initial motivation can easily be replaced by using shell environment variable or commands such as:

$ ./setup [...] --profile proxy-server --set proxy-user-dn:$PROXY_USER_DN --set proxy-user-password :`cat /path/to/password.txt`



This bug could be closed when setup tool will stop to try to resolve common configuration expression provided in profile parameter options.
