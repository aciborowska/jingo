Since both these backend types are used for administrative data (cn=admin data and cn=ads-truststore respectively) we should support backup and restore functionality. Note that it is trivial to perform a manual backup of these backends since both types of backend sync to disk after each update and comprise of a single file on disk.

However, it would be nice if they could be backed up as part of a "backup all" process before performing an upgrade or some other significant administrative task. In addition, supporting backup would allow these backends to be backed up remotely.

While implementing this functionality we should consider refactoring some of the code from the LDIF based config backend.
