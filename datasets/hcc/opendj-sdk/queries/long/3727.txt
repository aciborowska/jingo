If a user wants to reference an existing key store password file using the -u, --keyStorePasswordFile option, the setup tool will read the password in the file and copy it in the instance file config/keystore.pin.
This is quite misleading and not good for a container approach.
The server configuration should references directly the file provided by the user.
