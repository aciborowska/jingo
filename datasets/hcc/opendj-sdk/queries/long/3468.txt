We setup a server with some data.
We call ldifmodify with a set of changes in an ldif file that are inconsistent.


Ldif file containing the changes:

dn: uid=user.2000,ou=ldapsearch,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: add
objectClass: top
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalperson
objectClass: inetorgperson
givenName: Aarika
...

dn: uid=user.2000,ou=ldapsearch,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: delete

dn: uid=user.2000,ou=ldapsearch,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
replace: postalCode
postalCode: 50000



The previous behavior consisted in rejecting the changes with a return code of 1 and the following error message:

./opendj/bin/ldifmodify -s /tmp/data/clu_start.ldif -m /tmp/data/ldifmodify_concurrent.ldif 
-t /tmp/ldifmodify_concurrent.out

RC=1

Entry uid=user.2000,ou=ldapsearch,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com cannot be deleted because it was previously added in the set of changes.  This is not supported by the LDIF modify tool
Cannot modify entry uid=user.2000,ou=ldapsearch,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com because it was previously added or deleted in the set of changes.  This is not supported by the LDIF modify tool



Now the behavior has changed:


${INSTANCE1}/opendj/bin/ldifmodify -o ${TEMP_DIR}/ldifmodify_concurrent.out ${DATA_DIR}/clu_start.ldif ${DATA_DIR}/ldifmodify_concurrent.ldif

RC=82

The changes could not be applied for the following reason: The entry
"uid=user.2000,ou=ldapsearch,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com" could not be
modified because the entry does not exist
Ensure that no modification operations are done on previously added or deleted
entries.



Is this behavior expected?
It looks consistent to us but shouldn't we document this change?
