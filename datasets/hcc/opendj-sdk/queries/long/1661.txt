Using jconsole to connect as Directory Manager to DJ's JMX connection handler results in the following access logging:


[26/Nov/2014:20:25:05 +0000] BIND REQ conn=18 op=0 msgID=1 version=1.0 java_runtime_1.7.0_72-b14 type=SIMPLE dn="cn=Directory Manager"
[26/Nov/2014:20:25:05 +0000] BIND RES conn=18 op=0 msgID=1 result=0 authDN="cn=Directory Manager,cn=Root DNs,cn=config" etime=1



The version string is coming from the JMX connector, and probably shouldn't be logged as-is, as the resulting string may cause problems with tools parsing the access logs.
