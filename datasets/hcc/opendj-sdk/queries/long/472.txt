I was testing new import code and I noticed that the count of rejected entry was 0, the skipped set to 1, while the rejected file and the skipped file did contain the same entry.

[17/Apr/2012:11:57:01 +0200] category=JEB severity=NOTICE msgID=8847454 msg=Processed 3 entries, imported 2, skipped 1, rejected 0 and migrated 0 in 0 seconds (average rate 5.1/sec)

Looks like handling of LDIF exception is not fully consistent through the code
