The ldapsearch tool included with the server package advertises the following syntax for the --control argument:



-J, --control {controloid[:criticality[:value|::b64value|:<filePath]]}
    Use a request control with the provided information



If the value is specified as base64 it is not decoded and will be sent as a plain text interpretation over the wire.
