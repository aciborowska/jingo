Found on opendj3-server-dev branch (revision 10191).

The following commands fail (as expected) but don't report the same error message when running on branches/opendj3-server-dev or on trunk/opends.


$ opendj/bat/dsconfig.bat set-backend-prop --advanced --backend-name userRoot --set backend-id:foo -h dj-win2012641 -p 1444 -D "cn=myself" -w "password" -n -X
The "backend-id" property must not be modified as it is read-only



=> output on trunk/opends: The Local DB Backend property "backend-id" is read-only and cannot be modified


$ opendj/bin/dsconfig set-connection-handler-prop --handler-name "SNMP Connection Handler" --add community:myCommunity -h dj-ubuntu1204641 -p 1444 -D "cn=myself" -w "password" -n -X
The "community" property must not contain more than one value



=> output on trunk/opends:  It is not possible to specify multiple values for the SNMP Connection Handler property "community" as it is single-valued
