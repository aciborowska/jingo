Given the following configuration:

DJ1 server: Default setup configured with generated entries under a single dc=com backend
DJ2 server: Default setup configured with generated entries under a single dc=example,dc=com

PROXY server: Two proxy backends in route-all mode, each one addressing one of the previous configured DJ server.

On a subordinate search on dc=com, entries from both dc=com and dc=example,dc=com  base-dn should be returned.

Current behavior is that only entries under dc=com are returned.

Here we can see that only 2000 entries are returned (+2 for base-dn and ou=people) while 4004 are expected:


DJ_PROXY$ ./bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -b "dc=com" "objectclass=*" |grep "dn:" | wc -l
2002
