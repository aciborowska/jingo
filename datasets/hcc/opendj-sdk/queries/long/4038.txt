Found using OpenDJ 4.1.0-SNAPSHOT (rev 3026e65a3c2)

Running addrate tool with wrong password for instance:

$ SDK/opendj-ldap-toolkit/bin/addrate -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w wrongpassword -M 8000 -d 600 -S -C random -c 40 -i 6 -s 10000 /tmp/addrate.template
$ echo $?
49



The RC is correct but we have no error on stderr. I would expect to have "Invalid credential"
