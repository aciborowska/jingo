You get

Appendix I. Log Message Reference Missing

The log message reference is missing. It should be in ../../../target/logref/log-message-reference.xml.

This is because the above reference is broken in the preprocessed docbook for BackStage. The reference isn't resulting in an error while processing the docbook for BackStage because there is a fallback



<xinclude:include href="../../../target/logref/log-message-reference.xml">
