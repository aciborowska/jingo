Steps to reproduce:

	Install any of the OpenDJ server in the list (3.0.0-4.1.0 including OEM versions)
	run control-panel
	Open a "Manage Entries" window
	Close the "Manage Entries" window
	Try to stop the server using control-panel



Current behavior
The GUI hangs in infinite loop and the server is not stopped. 
We can close the control-panel and run it again and stop try to server again. This time the server is stopped. After investigation this looks directly related to accessing the Manage Entries section.

Expected behavior
I expect that server is stopped after last step.

Note:
Marking the issue as Minor, because a workaround exists (run control-panel again and stop the server without access to Manage Entries).
