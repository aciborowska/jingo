Comparing the userRoot entry in config.ldif and LocalDBBackendConfiguration.xml, there are some differences.

<attribute: value> (should be <property>)
ds-cfg-db-log-file-max: 10 megabytes (should be 100)
ds-cfg-db-checkpointer-bytes-interval: 20 megabytes (should be 500)
ds-cfg-db-evictor-lru-only: true (should be false)
ds-cfg-disk-full-threshold: 20 megabytes (should be 100)
ds-cfg-disk-low-threshold: 100 megabytes (should be 200)

The impact is that servers will be set up with properties known to be non-optimal.
