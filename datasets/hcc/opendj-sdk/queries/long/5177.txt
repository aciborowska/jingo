Following issue OPENDJ-4587, we have added some tests around medium consistency point.

For instance, we have one test that sets up 2 replicated DJs with data.
We stop one instance then perform an ldapmodify in parallel to add 100 users.
Then we check the lastchangenumber and expect it to be equal to 100 but it sticks to 0:


./DJ5/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h nameserver.example.com -p 1393 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -b "" -s base "(objectclass=*)" lastchangenumber

 [{'dn': '', 'lastchangenumber': ['0']}]



 This issue is reproducible with:


./run-pybot.py -n -s replication_group3.MediumConsistency -t No_Mods_Stop_One_Server opendj
