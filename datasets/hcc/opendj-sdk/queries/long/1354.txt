Performing modify operations against 2 DS are blocked and returning no response. 

Topology is 4 servers (2 DS m1/m4 and 2 RS m2/m3).

In access log on m4 we can see no response for modify, same for m1.

Looking at jstack on DS m1 and m4, these threads are BLOCKED.

It seems that the threads BLOCKED are doing either:

or

I've included the jstack for all 4 servers.
