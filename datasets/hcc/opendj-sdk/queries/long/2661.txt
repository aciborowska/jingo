'userPassword' attribute type  is defined in SDK with syntax octet string (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40) as per RFC 4519

'userPassword' attribute type is defined in server with syntax 1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.3.1 which is specific to OpenDJ

The specific DJ syntax is currently used in the server to check that an attribute has a valid password syntax or to determine if an attribute contains a password. This could not be achieved by using octet string syntax which is used by many attribute types that does not hold a password.

With the migration to SDK schema, it is no more possible to use a specific custom syntax for the 'userPassword' attribute type in the server. However, using the 'userPassword' attribute type with octet string syntax breaks the current behavior of the server. It is necessary to adapt the code of the server.

Ludo suggests the following approach: to check if an attribute type hold a password or has a valid syntax, either check that the attribute type is 'userPassword' or that the attribute type has the specific DJ syntax 1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.3.1.

It means that any non standard attribute type that hold a password should be defined with the specific DJ syntax 1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.3.1. The only exception is the standard 'userPassword' attribute.
