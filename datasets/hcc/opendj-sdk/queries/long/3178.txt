Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 and 3.5.0 RC1.

We setup 2 servers with some data, enable replication between the 2, initialize all.
We enable changelog confidentiality on both RS.

We add an entry, check that it is replicated and query the changelog.
Then we look into head.log files on both RS to check the entry is not in clear.

Afterwards, we set confidentiality off on one RS, add an entry and check it is in clear on this RS and not on the other.
then we set if off on second server and add another entry.

Entry is not in clear in the head.log
