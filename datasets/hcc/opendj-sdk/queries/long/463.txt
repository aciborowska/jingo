After migrating from Sun DSEE to OpenDJ there may be userPassword attributes present which contain attribute options. Currently, OpenDJ does not let you clean these up after the import:


./bin/ldapmodify -h matts-laptop -p 1389 -D cn=directory\ manager -w password
dn: uid=user.1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
delete: userPassword;deleted
- 

Processing MODIFY request for uid=user.1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
MODIFY operation failed
Result Code:  19 (Constraint Violation)
Additional Information:  Attributes used to hold user passwords are not allowed to have any attribute options



Fix is trivial: allow the modify to go through if the password is having values removed.
