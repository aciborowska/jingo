When performing an upgrade between 2 builds, if there is an error, it shows up in stdout instead of stderr:


./opendj/upgrade -n --acceptLicense --force 	
11:05:01.040 	INFO 	SUCCESS:
-- rc --
returned 1, effectively in [1] 	

STDOUT: 	 * The OpenDJ binary version '7.0.0.2083a8a903e22d1df1c3735d8e7180ca15512f9f'
 is older than the configuration version
 '7.0.0.7edf96904015a2483b8cd3a6aff51eb2da78fc4b', it usually means that an
 older version has been unzipped over the previous binaries. Unzip a more
 recent version than the configuration version and run upgrade again
