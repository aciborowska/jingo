After distributing users across multiple replication topologies, password reset (i.e. resetting another user's password) fails with No Such Entry:

$ /path/to/proxy/bin/ldappasswordmodify -p 1389 -D "uid=Data Admin" -w password -X -a dn:uid=user.0,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
The LDAP password modify operation failed: 32 (No Such Entry)
Additional Information:  The password modify extended request cannot be
processed because it was not possible to identify the user entry to update
based on the authorization DN of "uid=user.0,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
