Due to OPENDJ-6837, the documentation still covers the filter-use attribute, https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/ds/config-guide/#necessary-indexes.

Apparently this attribute has been replaced with other attributes on the backend entry. For example:


ds-mon-backend-filter-use-start-time: 20200102151555.687Z
ds-mon-backend-filter-use-indexed: 4
ds-mon-backend-filter-use-unindexed: 6
ds-mon-backend-filter-use: {"search-filter":"(employeenumber=86182)","nb-hits":1,"latest-failure-reason":"caseIgnoreMatch index type is disabled for the employeeNumber attribute"}
