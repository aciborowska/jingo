Now that server has been migrated to the new configuration framework, the example plugin should work again.
Looking at the opendj-server-example-plugin module to test it, I see that the code is uncomplete, for example:

	the ExamplePlugin class does not inherits from DirectoryPlugin
	no behavior is implemented (the plugin is supposed to output a message at server startup)



Moreover, the README is outdated.
