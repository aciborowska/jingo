REST2LDAP implements an action called passwordModify.

This action wraps two conceptually similar but different actions:


	A password modify action, whereby the current password is changed to a password value supplied by the client.This action would be performed by the user who knows their credentials.
	A password reset action, whereby the current password is changed to a value generated by the server.This action would be performed by a user who has forgotten their password, or by a password administrator.



The expected request body and response resources are distinct for each of these actions:


	Password modify takes an old password value and a new password value and returns an empty JSON resource on success.
	Password reset takes an empty JSON request body and returns a generated password value.



The passwordModify action therefore ought to be split into two separate actions.
