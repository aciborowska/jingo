To help us manage the different lifecycles of backported issues, we create separate JIRAs which are linked to the "parent" JIRA, which is usually the issue fixed on master. We note both JIRAs in the commit messages, i.e. OPENDJ-2345 backport OPENDJ-1234 paint the bike shed green

However for customers tracking issues it is easier to just use the parent JIRA, and that's what we've been reporting in the (e.g. 5.5.1) release notes. (It means they just have one number to check in all the release notes.)

Can you change the list of fixes in 5.5.2 to just have the parent JIRAs, i.e. OPENDJ-1234 paint the bike shed green.
