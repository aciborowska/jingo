Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 (rev 95c3fd4549c)

One of the changes made in production mode is the file permissions for the logs set to 0600.
On Windows the file permissions for the 'logs/errors' file are not correctly set to this value.

Output from test:

Expected "0600" but found "0666" for file: E:\results\20170325-030959\setup_group\ProductionMode\DJ_PROD1\opendj\logs\errors
