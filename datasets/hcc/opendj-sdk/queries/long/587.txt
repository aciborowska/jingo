When rebuilding one or more indexes of a local server, through the control-panel, the backend is first disabled, then the rebuild-index offline command is run and then backend is enabled again.
rebuild-index like all tools has 2 modes, and the offline mode should only be used with the local server if it is not running.
Using online mode for a running server means that the control-panel doesn't need to disable the backend, it's managed by the rebuild-index task itself.
