After a successful upgrade from 2.6.0 to 2.6.1 or later, attempting to restart via "stop-ds.bat -R" fails and mangles the environment:


C:\Users\Chris\Desktop\ds2\OpenDJ-2.6.0\opendj>bat\stop-ds -R
 Stopping Server... 
\Java\jre7\bin\java.exe\logs\"" was unexpected at this time.
C:\Users\Chris\Desktop\ds2\OpenDJ-2.6.0\opendj>echo %PATH%
 C:\Windows;C:\Windows




Re-running dsjavaproperties after the upgrade fixes the problem. It looks like the fix for OPENDJ-1322 requires this as an upgrade task, as it corrects errors in lib\set-java-home.bat
