In the documentation (3.5) 17.5.2.3. Syslog Audit Event Handler Configuration and (4.0) 18.5.1.1.7. Configuring Access Logging to Syslog, the description for "field" mentions 



"field": string,   // JSON pointer to field defined in audit event schema.



However, the schema file is not found anywhere, either in a deployed instance, or in this documentation. Without knowing what JSON pointers are valid, this feature is unusable.

The "valueMapings" also probably deserves more explanation, as it seems to be more a filter+mapping, e.g as explained by Mark off line :



"field": "client/ip", "valueMappings": {"127.0.0.1": "local0"} means when client IP is on loopback send the message to local0.
