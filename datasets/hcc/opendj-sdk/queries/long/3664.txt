With the addition of the JSON-based access log, OpenDJ now ends up with two access log formats by default: the native access log format and the JSON format. This is the behavior for LDAP access and for HTTP access.

Because access logging can be a bottleneck in high-throughput directory services, the Admin Guide has recommended not enabling more than one format at a time.

Either change the server behavior to have only one format active by default (e.g. JSON in new servers) per connection handler. Or change the Admin Guide.
