Found uisng OpenDJ 3.5.0 rev 566523750c522af582d185e7d328d7e4086244f8

I found several issues doing some tests on Windows Service in which we are doing in a loop start and stop of the service using:

	sc command
	stop-ds/start-ds
	the services management



Scenario 1
1. disable the service
2. reboot the machine 
=> after the reboot the server not started as expected
=> but service no more in the services list (workaround run "windows-service.bat -e" to add it back)

Scenario 2
1. in a loop do "stop-ds -R"
=> I got one time the following error:

Stopping Server...
An unexpected error occurred stopping the server windows service
Exception:java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException: process has not exited
ERROR RC: 3


=> the server was correctly stopped
=> no side-effect on the next loop, I was able to start the server

Scenario 3
3. in a loop do "windows-service -d/windows-serve -e"
=> I got multiple time the following error:

.\bat\windows-service.bat -d
An unexpected error occurred trying to disable the server as a Windows service
Check that you have administrator rights (only Administrators can disable the
server as a Windows Service)
ERROR RC: 3


=> the service was correctly disabled
=> no side-effect on the next loop, I was able to do "windows-service.bat -e" 

4. in a loop do "sc stop/sc start"
=> after few loop the "sc stop" has failed with:

sc stop "OpenDJ Server"
[SC] ControlService FAILED 109:
The pipe has been ended.
ERROR RC: 109


=> the service was correctly stopped
=> no side-effect on the next loop, I was able to do "sc start"
