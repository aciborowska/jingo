On performing 'dsreplication reset-change-number', there have been occasions where it fails with the following error:


Cannot reset change-log change number because replicated baseDNs on server
<server1>:<port1> and server <server2>:<port2> differ.
Since the change number is computed across all the replicated baseDNs, the
change-log change number can only be reset between two replication servers
replicating the exact same baseDNs.

However, the replicated baseDNs and namingContexts are all same between the two servers, thus making it very hard to troubleshoot the issue.

The error message should list the baseDNs so that we can spot the differences. At the moment, the message is too generic and appears to be misleading.
