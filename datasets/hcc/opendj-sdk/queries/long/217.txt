Schema validation can produce a schema which has an invalid internal state.

In particular:

1) if a child attribute type is validated before its superior then it will inherit the superior's uninitialized syntax and matching rules

2) object class validation ensures that the superior has been validated first, but if the validation fails then it is unclear what state the schema is left in.

3) need better error handling for the case where an attribute type does not specify a syntax nor a superior.
