If I extend the schema with a non numeric OID and then restart OpenDJ, I don't get any error in the OpenDJ error log, but when running the control panel, it complains about the first character of the OID since it's not a digit.

For example, if I try the admin guide example to define a reg. exp. based
syntax like the one below, the control-panel sends a warning about character s: 

ldapSyntaxes: ( simple-sip-uri-syntax-oid DESC 'Lenient SIP URI Syntax'
X-PATTERN '^sip:[a-zA-Z0-9.]@[a-zA-Z0-9.](:[0-9]+)?$' )
