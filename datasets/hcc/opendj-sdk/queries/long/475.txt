OpenDJ is not behaving correctly when a non-critical control, which is not explicitly allowed by any ACI, is set in a request.

This can be reproduced quite easily by running the following ldapsearch with any unknown Control:

 bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -b "" -s base  -J 1.3.6.1.4.1.1111 'objectclass=*'

Such an operation returns result code 50 (insufficientAccessRights)

The intended behaviour is described in RFC4511, 4.1.11:

 [...]
   - If the server does not recognize the control type, determines that
     it is not appropriate for the operation, or is otherwise unwilling
     to perform the operation with the control, and if the criticality
     field is FALSE, the server MUST ignore the control.
 [...]



According to this definition OpenDJ should ignore such controls.

Looking at the code, e.g. LocalBackendSearchOperation.java, there is a method "handleRequestControls()" which contains the following lines

     if (! AccessControlConfigManager.getInstance().
                   getAccessControlHandler().isAllowed(baseDN, this, c))
        {
          throw new DirectoryException(ResultCode.INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS_RIGHTS,
                         ERR_CONTROL_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS_RIGHTS.get(oid));
        }


IMHO, this should be extended so that the exception is only thrown when the control is marked as critical.
