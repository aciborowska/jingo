Found with OpenDJ 3.0.0 rev 7084f6583704d1cc371242937e9b13698f57c66b
On any OS with JE

Scenario:

We have a DJ installed with a default JE backend configured with db-cache-percent=50

We add a backend with db-cache-percent set to 40

We try adding a backend with db-cache-percent set to 50, expected for this backend creation to fail as it goes beyond the 100% limit.

The problem is that the backend is created anyway.
