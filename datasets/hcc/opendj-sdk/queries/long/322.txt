The following LDIF creates an entry including userCertificate and replaces the userCertificate with another value:

dn: cn=Barbara Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: add
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
sn: Jensen
usercertificate:< file:///tmp/cert1.der

dn: cn=Barbara Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
replace: usercertificate
usercertificate:< file:///tmp/cert1.der

This results in an entry which contains the following attributes and values:

dn: cn=Barbara Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
userCertificate;binary:: (...base64 value of cert1.der's contents...)
userCertificate:: (...base64 value of cert2.der's contents...)

So it seems that the binary option is not automatically added for replace operations and the old value is not deleted.
