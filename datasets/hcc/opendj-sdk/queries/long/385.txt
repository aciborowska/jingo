Nothing is returned when I perform an LDIF search of an OpenDJ config.ldif file searching for all Local DB Backend components (ds-cfg-local-db-backend). This is because the object class ds-cfg-local-db-backend is not defined in the default schema and as a result all filter comparisons evaluated to UNDEFINED.

The reason is that the OID equality matching rule requires that both the assertion value and the attribute value are defined in the schema. This seems far too strict to me. If both are undefined then I think it is ok to assume that if they are the same string then they can be treated as equal.
