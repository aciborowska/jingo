When we build OpenDJ, we create a reference schema under config/upgrade that is used to identify changes for future upgrade.
That file does not contain the ldapSyntaxes.
Since revision 6311, there's an ldapSyntaxes value defined in our schema and since it's not part of the reference schema, upgrade generated errors.
