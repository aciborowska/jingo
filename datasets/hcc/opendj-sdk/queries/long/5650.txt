In ticket 34493 the customer has run the support extract tool, but claims:

the version of top under Alpine Linux does not have all the options given in the article (e.g. -H or -p). Therefore the results in the Extract tool are probably empty. 

I don't know how we'd check for that, or if htop has a suitable mode for outputting to a file.

Alpine Linux is a popular small distro used with docker, so this could be important to address.
