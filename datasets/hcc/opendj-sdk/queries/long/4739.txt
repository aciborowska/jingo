When you want to monitor an RS (no user store) over HTTP, you cannot do so with the default configuration.

The default HTTP Basic authorization mechanism uses an identity mapper that maps the incoming HTTP username to the LDAPÂ uid value of a user entry in one of the public naming contexts. Yet the only users available by default are probably cn=Directory Manager and maybe uid=admin neither of whose entries are stored in public naming contexts. (Maybe the latter doesn't have the monitor-read privilege either.)
