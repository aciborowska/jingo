OpenAM's Heartbeat facility can fill up OpenDJ logs, but these log lines cannot be filtered from logs.

OpenDJ cannot filter these...



The Access Log Filtering Criteria could not be created because of the
following reason:

    *  Unwilling to Perform: The Directory Server is unwilling to add
       configuration entry cn=No Heartbeats,cn=Filtering Criteria,cn=File-Based
       Access Logger,cn=Loggers,cn=config because one of the add listeners
       registered with the parent entry cn=Filtering Criteria,cn=File-Based
       Access Logger,cn=Loggers,cn=config rejected this change with the
       message: The access log filtering criteria defined in "cn=No
       Heartbeats,cn=Filtering Criteria,cn=File-Based Access
       Logger,cn=Loggers,cn=config" could not be parsed because it contains an
       invalid target DN pattern """"

OpenDJ should have the ability to filter these searches.
