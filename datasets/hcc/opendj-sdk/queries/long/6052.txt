As Petr Matej [X] found out, supportextract archive logs contain wrapped lines:

2019-03-05 10:06:44 INFO -
/home/petr/git/pyforge/results/20190305-100331/clu_group/SupportExtract/DJ_SPLIT/instance/logs/access
2019-03-05 10:06:44 INFO -
/home/petr/git/pyforge/results/20190305-100331/clu_group/SupportExtract/DJ_SPLIT/instance/logs/http-access
2019-03-05 10:06:44 INFO -

While this makes sense for the console output, line wrapping is not suitable for the archive logs because it makes it difficult for automatic log analysis. 

This issue can be closed once supportextract does not wrap lines in the archive logs.
