Steps to reproduce:

1) setup a simple topology with 1 proxy, and 2 replicated DS's behind it (static discovery)

2) fire a persistent search on the proxy


./bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1392 -D cn=proxy,dc=com -w password -C ps:all -b dc=com "(description=*)"


3) checkÂ  the access log of the two DS's, to see wich one the psearch got routed to

4) stop the server that has the psearch on it

Expected bahavior:

	the psearch should get transfered to the other DS



Current behavior:

	sometimes (almost every time on the lab machine, around 50% on my laptop) the psearch fails with 91 (Connection Error), and does not get transfered.
