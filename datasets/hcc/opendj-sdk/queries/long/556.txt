I am getting strange results with ACI's

I created an aci -
aci: (target = "ldap:///dc=1,dc=com") (targetattr = "*") (targetscope = "base") (version 3.0; acl "Dannys test"; allow (read, search, compare) (userdn = "ldap:///anyone")

And when I run a search I get the following -

	ldapsearch -b dc=1,dc=com "objectclass=*"
dn: dc=1,dc=com
nisDomain: 1.com
dc: 1
objectClass: domain
objectClass: nisDomainObject
objectClass: top



If I modify the ACI to restrict the attributes -
aci: (target = "ldap:///dc=1,dc=com") (targetattr != "aci") (targetscope = "base") (version 3.0; acl "Dannys test"; allow (read, search, compare) (userdn = "ldap:///anyone")

And run the same search - 

	ldapsearch -T -b dc=1,dc=com "objectclass=*"
#



Theoretically there should be no difference between the output because I am not requesting the aci attribute in my search.

This is the only aci applied to the dn and the only change from the default is that the Global Anonymous read ACI has been disabled.
