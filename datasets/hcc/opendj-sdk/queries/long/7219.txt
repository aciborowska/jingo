In up to and including 6.0.x, PreParseAddOperation plugins were able to effectively remove attributes from the operation by calling setAttributes(List<Attribute>)

Part of the refactoring to use the SDK in OPENDJ-3106 appears to have removed this functionality. Now all PreParseAddOperation plugins can do is add/merge attributes using addAttribute(Attribute): see 5d6b47e05e.

This seems like a regression in the public API.
