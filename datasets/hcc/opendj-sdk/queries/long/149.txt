The script stopped with a "Schema Migration Error":

An attempt to modify entry cn=schema to the newly upgraded server was
unsuccessful.

You can cancel this upgrade altogether, continue anyway or retry this
operation.  If you cancel the server will be restored to the state it was in
before the upgrade was attempted.  If you continue you should be aware that
the server may not configured as it was before this upgrade.  A copy of the
original installation files will be kept in
