This is an issue that has been nagging me for some time. 
When doing an online import, the LDIF file(s) must be a reference to a file local to the server, and readable. It can be specified as an absolute path (recommended) or a relative path to the server instance directory.

import-ldif -p 5444 -D cn=directory\ manager -w secret12 -X -n userRoot -l ./config/example.ldif

But the backend is cleared before checking whether the server can access the file. So in case of error, there is a proper error message, but the backend no longer contain any data. 
This problem has been experimented by almost every tester and a few customers.
