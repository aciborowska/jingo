Found using OpenDJ 5.5.0 RC2

In the legal-notices for opendj-core jar file we have the following versions:

	in the legal-notices/copyrights.txt file: opendj-core-5.5.0-RC2
	in the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file: Bundle-Version: 5.5.0.RC2



Moreover we found the same kind of issue with some tools in the server:
1. unzip DS-5.5.0-RC2.zip
2. execute start-ds -F

$ ./opendj/bin/start-ds -F
ForgeRock Directory Services 5.5.0-RC2
Build ID: 20170930142504
Major Version: 5
Minor Version: 5
Point Version: 0
Version Qualifier: RC2
...


=> version and version qualifier are separated with a "-" as expected
3. run verify-index -V

$ ./opendj/bin/verify-index -V
ForgeRock Directory Services 5.5.0-RC2
Build 20170930142504


=> version and version qualifier are separated with a "-" as expected
4. now run ldapsearch -V

$ ./opendj/bin/ldapsearch -V
5.5.0.RC2 (revision bfe201fb9eef01c020d357781282209d52923a92)


=> here version and version qualifier are separated with a "." so not consistent
