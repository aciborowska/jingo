During investigation of OpenDJ 3 tests I discovered an issue with privileges.
It looks they aren't check if the user hasn't got "unindexed-search" privilege when doing a search on small number of entries.

The scenario which I tried is following:
1) I installed OpenDJ 3 with new backend.
2) I imported 23 entries.
3) I changed the index-entry-limit => "index-entry-limit:4"
4) After I imported another entries (54 entries)  
5) I provided an unindexed search with user which don't have unindexed-search privilege and I expected result code 50 (no sufficient access rights) but I received 0.
6) I checked if the search is unindexed by provided ldapsearch with admin account and debugindexsearch parameter.

I have attached script to quick reproduce. At the end of the output from script you can see result code (0 but should be 50) of ldapsearch provided by user without privilege and also ldapsearch provided by admin user with debugindexsearch parameter.

Same test case work like a charm on JE and this start to happens from 25.04.2015.
