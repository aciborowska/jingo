setup OpenDJ on the server side, generate the default self-singed cert

setup OpenDJ on the client side and use 'control-panel' to connect to the remote host.

When connecting control-panel shows the attached screen to trust the certificate.

However '0.0.0.0' is misleading as control-panel is used to connect to a remote server. It seems control-panel is using the listener config from the server side to generate this screen.
