Different number of results is returned when DJ is upgraded - cn=myself is missing. When DJ is installed and not upgraded cn=myself is found

Steps

1. Install DJ (7.0.0) and check number of entries


ldapsearch -h pyforge.example.com -p 1389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -b "" --countEntries "(objectclass=*)" dn


2. Install DJ (4.0.0) and upgrade to 7.0.0 and check number of entries


ldapsearch -h pyforge.example.com -p 1389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -b "" --countEntries "(objectclass=*)" dn

 3. Compare number of entries without and with upgrade

To reproduce:

./run-pybot.py -s clu_group.LdapSearch_DJ -t Check_Default_Basedn opendj


Expected result:

Both ldapsearch with and without upgrade should find cn=myself and same number of entries.

Actual result:
 Entries found without upgrade

Total number of matching entries: 1083

Entries found with upgrade - cn=myself is missing

Total number of matching entries: 1082
