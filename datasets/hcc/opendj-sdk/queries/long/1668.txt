There is an infinite loop when searching against server with the --simplePageSize option activated. The problem seems to come from the cookie returned by server which is not updated so ldapsearch tool run the same request again and again. The bug is related to the following unit test:  LDAPSearchTestCase#testSimplePagedResults.
Here is the setup command ran to install the server:


./setup --cli -D cn=myself -w password -p 1389 -h localhost --adminConnectorPort 4444 -b dc=example,dc=com -d 2000 -Z 1636 -n --generateSelfSignedCertificate --acceptLicense


And here is the ldapsearch command which hangs forever:


./ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D cn=myself -w password -b ou=People,dc=example,dc=com -s one --simplePageSize 2 --countEntries --noPropertiesFile "(objectClass=*)"
