The property response-etime-greater-than and property response-etime-less-than does not work in the right order.

For example:



	Set filtering criteria for response-etime-greater-than as below:
	
		dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D 'cn=Directory Manager' --no-prompt -w password set-log-publisher-prop --publisher-name "File-Based Access Logger" --set filtering-policy:inclusive
		dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D 'cn=Directory Manager' --no-prompt -w password set-access-log-filtering-criteria-prop --publisher-name "File-Based Access Logger" --criteria-name "Log only message with greater duration" --set response-etime-greater-than:8
	
	




	Provide basic ldapsearch commands
	
		In log appears messages with etime=0, etime=2 etc.
	
	




	Set filtering criteria for response-etime-less-than as below:
	
		dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D 'cn=Directory Manager' --no-prompt -w password set-access-log-filtering-criteria-prop --publisher-name "File-Based Access Logger" --criteria-name "Log only message with less duration" --set response-etime-less-than:2000000
	
	




	Provide basic ldapsearch commands
	
		In log does not appear any message with etime property, for example SEARCH messages
	
	



NOTE: Also tested in combination of 'greater' and 'less' property in one time and also as standalone properties.
