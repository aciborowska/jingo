Attempting to set a password policy with an array value for the password-validator property results in an error:

The request cannot be processed because an array of values was provided for the single valued field '/password-validator'


Other rest operations (such as PATCH) fail in the same way:


[{
 "operation": "add",
 "field": "/password-validator",
 "value": [{
 "_id": "saas-length-validator"
 }, {
 "_id": "saas-char-validator"
 }]
}]

Two 'operation' blocks in the same PATCH body results in success, but only the secondÂ validator referenced is applied.
