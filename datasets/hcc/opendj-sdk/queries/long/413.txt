See OPENDJ-410 for more background.

Proposed fixes:


	verify-index should generate the set of index keys from the referenced entry and check that the set contains the current key
	verify-index should no longer check that the previous key is less than the current. I'm not sure why this check is done to be honest since this is an intrinsic property of a b-tree.
