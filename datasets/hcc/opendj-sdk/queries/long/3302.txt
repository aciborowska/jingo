In the SchemaHandler class, offline schema modifications are detected at initialization time. These modifications are then retrieved in Multimaster.initializeSynchronizationProvider() method in order to be propagated to other servers.
However, the modification regarding the configuration (schema elements from the 02-config.ldif file) must not be replicated because the definitions may vary between versions of OpenDJ.
