Enabling replication on servers having confidential backends requires following a precise sequence of steps (described in the admin guide), otherwise symmetric keys used to encrypt user data will be lost and configuration cannot proceed.
For example, if a server contains some data and it is introduced into a topology but not initialized, restarting it may generate errors because the keys have been replaced when admin data was replicated, but if it is not restarted before initialization, in memory keys may be used when encrypt replicated data instead of those specified in cn=admin data. 
This could be avoided by making sure in memory keys are invalidated whenever cn=admin data is replicated.
