Using dsconfig in interactive mode, after selecting a configuration object type in the main menu (asÂ Backend for example), we have the following menu printed:


>>>> Backend management menu

What would you like to do?

    1)  Create a new Backend
    2)  View and edit an existing Backends
    3)  Delete an existing Backend
    4)  List existing Backends



The formulation View and edit an existing Backends is wrong and should be replaced by View and edit an existing Backend
