Setting an "idle-time-limit" global configuration property has no effect.
How to reproduce the issue


	Setup a standalone instance with default configuration/ACIs
	Set a idle-time-limit in global configuration, for example 3 mins:

dsconfig set-global-configuration-prop \
          --set idle-time-limit:180s \
          --hostname opendj1.example.com \
          --port 4444 \
          --bindDn cn=Directory\ Manager \
          --bindPassword ****** \
          --trustAll \
          --no-prompt


	BIND as a non-root client connection.Any anonymous connection from a client (Apache Directory Studio for example) will do.
	Leave the client connected and idle beyond the configured timeout of 3 mins.



EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR
Client should be disconnected and a message logged in the access logs, as in version 3.5.x:

[09/Jul/2018:16:13:31 +0100] DISCONNECT conn=1 reason="Idle Time Limit Exceeded" msg="This connection has been terminated because it has remained idle for too long"



CURRENT BEHAVIOUR
Idle client connections are not disconnected beyond the configured time out.
