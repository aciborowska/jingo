We have a test that sets up a server and schedules a restore task on it:

./DJ1/opendj/bin/restore -h openam.example.com -p 4444 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X -d /root/workspace/OpenDJ-build_master-CPMER56E632EMKNXZEURRUYWFHY72MGZDGZHN7BYLM5SGO6GS6PA/results/20190924-223729/tasks_group/tmp/tasks/backup_synchronous -I recurring-restore-1 --recurringTask "0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42,44,46,48,50,52,54,56,58 * * * *"



This test has failed during the pipeline execution (task did not complete) and there were error in logs:

The test that triggered it:

./run-pybot.py -s tasks_group.RestoreDb -t Schedule_Recurring_Restore_Task_For_Scheduled_Execution_In_Asynchronous_Mode opendj



Still this looks like this is hardly reproducible. (it happened once and i was not able to reproduce it)
