Found using trunk (r10714) and opendj3-server-dev branch (r10711).

Scenario:
*********
1. install 2 servers
2. enable replication
3. perform some operations (search, add,...)
4. uninstall the first server and don't remove log files
$ uninstall.bat --cli -n -I admin -w password -X --server-libraries --databases --backup-files --ldif-files
5. check logs for specific errors (SEVERE_ERRORS, Exception,...)

=> in the logs/errors file of the server we can found the following DISCONNECT messages/patterns:

	DISCONNECT conn=[0-9]+ reason="I/O Error" msg="An IO error occurred while reading a request from the client: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received fatal alert: certificate_unknown"
	DISCONNECT conn=[0-9]+ reason="I/O Error" msg="An IO error occurred while reading a request from the client: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received close_notify during handshake"
	DISCONNECT conn=[0-9]+ reason="I/O Error" msg="An IO error occurred while reading a request from the client: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Unrecognized SSL message, plaintext connection?"
	DISCONNECT conn=[0-9]+ reason="Protocol Error" msg="The client sent a request to the Directory Server that could not be properly decoded as an LDAP message: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Inbound closed before receiving peer's close_notify: possible truncation attack?"
	DISCONNECT conn=[0-9]+ reason="Protocol Error" msg="The client sent a request to the Directory Server that could not be properly decoded as an LDAP message: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received fatal alert: certificate_unknown"
	DISCONNECT conn=[0-9]+ reason="Protocol Error" msg="The client sent a request to the Directory Server that could not be properly decoded as an LDAP message: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received close_notify during handshake"
