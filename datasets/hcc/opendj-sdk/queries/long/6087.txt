Found with 7.0.0 rev a5bb21b945b

We have found a difference in behavior in our proxy tests for failover.

We set up 2 DJs with data and 2 RSs and configure replication between them.
We put DJ1 and RS1 in a first group, DJ2 and RS2 in a second group.
We set up a proxy, with replication discovery mechanism, and a primary group id to match the first group.
Then we stop DJ1 and try ldapmodify to add an entry through the proxy directly after the stop.
The request is hanging.

Before, ldapmodify would have failed at first with:

returned 91, expected to be in [0] 

# The LDAP modify request failed: 91 (Connect Error) 
# Additional Information: No operational connection factories available
