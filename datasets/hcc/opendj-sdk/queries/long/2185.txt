Hypothetical steps to reproduce:


	create three way topology of combined DS/RS
	apply changes
	verify change number changelog content correct
	stop DS/RS3
	fake up network partition between DS/RS3 and the others
	start DS/RS3
	apply changes to DS3
	apply changes to DS1+DS2
	expected bug: change number indexing continues despite partition.



Suggested fix:

An RS must not accept connections from a DS until it is sure that all of the other RSs are aware that it has rejoined the topology.
