Not sure core functionality is exposed, but removing backups with the database object fails with message:

The information for backup backupID1 could not be found in the backup directory /var/folders/nd/7tc3d1dx5d5c195xsycw2p_r0000gn/T/backup4208751930144764416.tmp


I think it may also happen if a backup task is cancelled.
