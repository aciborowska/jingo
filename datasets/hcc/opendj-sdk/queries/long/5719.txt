The `ds-mon-active-persistent-searches` metric from LDAP Connection Handlers is not correctly maintained.

While it is correctly incremented when a persistent search is received and correctly decremented upon persistent search cancellation (when a Result is sent), it is not decremented when a connectionÂ get closed with active persistent searches.
