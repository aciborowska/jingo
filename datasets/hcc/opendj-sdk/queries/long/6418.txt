Found with rev 662cb20ef80d9fab0fbe801335931f63594eb7e9

We have a test that tries a backup command as an unprivileged user.
This used to fail with an "insufficient  access rights" error message but now fails and displays a message that suggests it cannot retrieve the version of the server:


/local/GIT/pyforge/results/20190628-171539/privileges_group/DJ1/opendj/bin/backup -h openam.example.com -p 4444 -D "uid=auser,o=Privileges Tests,dc=example,dc=com" -w ACIRules -X -d /tmp -a

Other: There was an error trying to read the remote server version: Other:
Tool version does not match remote server version. Please use the same tool
version as the server one.
Tool version: '7.0.0.662cb20ef80d9fab0fbe801335931f63594eb7e9'
Server version: 'Unknown'



To reproduce:

./run-pybot.py -n -v -s privileges_group -t Backend_Backup opendj
