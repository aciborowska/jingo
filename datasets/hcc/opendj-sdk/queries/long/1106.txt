Found using revision 9332.

The problem was found in a replicated topology with fractional replication configuration:

	one master
	one replica with a subset of data (only description attribute is replicated)
Moreover in this configuration, we use the default ACIs and privileges.



Directory manager tries to add (with ldapmodify) an entry with filterable attributes in the replica and this operation fails as expected with the following error:

ERROR : RC=50, Expected 53, Result=[[0, 'Processing ADD request for uid=added-user.0,ou=People,o=example
ADD operation failed
Result Code: 50 (Insufficient Access Rights)
']]



But the operation should not fail due to insufficient rights (especially with directory manager) and we should get:

SUCCESS: RC=53, Expected 53, Result=[[0, 'Processing ADD request for uid=added-user.0,ou=People,o=example
ADD operation failed
Result Code: 53 (Unwilling to Perform)
Additional Information: The following operation has been forbidden in suffix o=example due to inconsistency with the fractional replication configuration : AddOperation(connID=4, opID=1, dn=uid=added-user.0,ou=People,o=example)
']]
