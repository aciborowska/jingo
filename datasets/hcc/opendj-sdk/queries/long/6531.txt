When running setup on Windows for the first time, the deployment key is displayed in the output, but the cmd.exe window closes after setup completes successfully.

So unless the user quickly and carefully reads what shows up in the windows and copies the deployment key, the key is lost.

This is not a problem if the user opens a cmd.exe shell to run setup from the command line. It is a problem if the user double-clicks setup.bat or runs setup from PowerShell. (Double-clicking setup.bat is perhaps the most likely action for a first-time user.)

When the setup command generates a key to copy, the script needs to prompt the user to confirm they've copied the key before closing the cmd.exe window.
