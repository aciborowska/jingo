If integration of a 3rd party CA signed cert is not done properly this can cause not that easy to troubleshoot SSL related issue.

Problem situation:

Keystore used by 'Key Management Provider', referenced by LDAPS connection handler did not include a 'PrivateKeyEntry' but 'trustedCertificateEntry' only due to whatever reason.

If OpenDJ is starting up the LDAPS connection handler is creating a socket just fine, however SSL connections fail as the keying material needed is missing on the server side.

Inexperienced troubleshooters do not get much info if


openssl s_client -connect OPENDJ_HOST:OPENDJ_LDAPS_PORT



just fails with a one-liner.
