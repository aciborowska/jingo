I've built from trunk today (Sep 09) and deployed 2 replicated servers using my historical script DSreplconf.sh (just did a setup of repl, no operation done).
After a few minutes, I could no longer use my machine, which ran out of file descriptors. 
After investigation, using lsof I can see that both processes keep on opening Space/Tests/Scratch/D2/changelogDb/changenumberindex/head.log, leaking descriptors.

Fabio reproduced the issue with a single server, just enabling replication.
