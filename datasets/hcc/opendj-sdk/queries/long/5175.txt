When the server.pid file is empty , stop-ds bails out with the following, misleading error message

./stop-ds
Stopping Server...
kill: usage: kill [-s sigspec | -n signum | -sigspec] pid | jobspec ... or kill -l [sigspec]
ERROR:  Cannot parse the value of the port argument as an integer value
between 1 and 65535:  The port argument does not have any value that may be
retrieved as an integer
