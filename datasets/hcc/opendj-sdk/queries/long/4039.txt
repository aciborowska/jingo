Found using OpenDJ 4.1.0-SNAPSHOT (rev 3026e65a3c2)

In one of our stress test we run addrate tool for one hour, the tool starts correctly and performs some operations but after few minutes it exits with "Invalid Credentials".

This problem also happen on OpenDJ 4.0 when running on JDK 8 (tested withÂ jdk1.8.0_131)
