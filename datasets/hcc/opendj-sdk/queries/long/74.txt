I have seen unit test failures where the replication state DB is closed with remaining cursors open. The only place where we use cursors for this DB that I can see is in ReplicationDbEnv and there is indeed scope for cursors 

This was fixed on the trunk as part of r6702. We should backport this part of the change to the 2.4 branch.
