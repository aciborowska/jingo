Interactive mode for ./dsreplication initialize and ./dsreplication reset-change-number has the same problem as described in OPENDJ-3709 for ./dsreplication configure interactive.

Steps to reproduce:
Same as for OPENDJ-3709 but change the command used to either initialize or reset-change-number, and the interactive session ends with an SSL handshake error:


Error reading data from server localhost:4444.  There is an error with the
certificate presented by the server.
Details: Local Error: SSL handshake failed
