If I issue the following command:-

/opt/opendj/bin/dsconfig set-plugin-prop --plugin-name 'UID Unique Attribute' --set base-dn:dc=globaldomain --set enabled:true --port 4444 --hostname host.test.com --bindDN 'cn=Directory Manager' --bindPassword password --no-prompt --trustAll

The command completes successfully, but there is a blank line thrown on stderr.

If I re-issue the same command the blank line does not appear however if I change the command, say setting enabled to false, then the blank line appears.

I realise it isn't a major issue, but it confused a script which was looking for returns and saw a return code of 0 (success), but an output to stderr !!
