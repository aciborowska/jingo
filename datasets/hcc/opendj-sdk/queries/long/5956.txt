If an attribute is present in the DN and as an RDN and has different values between them, for example:


dn: phonebooklocation=THA      44 3rd Floor,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
........
phonebooklocation: Tha 44 3rd floor

[Please note the difference in case and the spacing between words in the above]

Then,

1) If you configure replication from this server to a second server and intialize the data, it is seen that on the second server, the value in the RDN is modifed to match that of the DN. That is, the data is modified to:


dn: phonebooklocation=THA      44 3rd Floor,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
........
phonebooklocation: THA      44 3rd Floor

However, the first server continues to show:


dn: phonebooklocation=THA      44 3rd Floor,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
........
phonebooklocation: Tha 44 3rd floor

Thus there is discrepancy between the two servers.

2) The behaviour can be seen even if you export-ldif from the first server and import the ldif to the same or any other server.

This behaviour was not seen in earlier versions of DJ.
