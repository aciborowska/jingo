InternalLdapClientSocket connectivity state does not behave like InternalConnection. Indeed, the InternalClientSocket#close() tries to create an operation from UnbindRequest which is not a supported operation on internal connection and triggers an NPE.

Acceptance criteria:

InternalLdapClientSocket connectivity handling is on par with the one in InternalConnection.
