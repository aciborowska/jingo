By reading a documentation and trying examples I noticed an example showing how to enable rest2ldap http endpoint . See link: https://forgerock.org/opendj/doc/bootstrap/admin-guide/index.html#setup-rest2ldap-endpoint  . 

It contains a property authentication-required, which is obsolete from my point of view, because when I tried the command I noticed following message in the dsconfig output:

The property "authentication-required" is not a recognized property of
Rest2ldap Endpoints
