Bernhard and Chris have noticed some problems in the Developer's Guide chapter on Understanding LDAP:


	Need to introduce the idea of operational attributes, and mention that they're not returned by default in an LDAP search
	Description of the abandon operation is wrong (the operation is abandoned, not the connection), and the diagram is not helpful. It would be good for the diagram to show that multiple operations can be interleaved on the same connection.
	Footnote 2 is misleading about base64 encoding
