In our test for the JsonOrderingMatchingRule, we create a custom schema provider for this rule, then configure it like this:


./bin/dsconfig -h viktor.internal.forgerock.com -p 4444 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -X set-schema-provider-prop --provider-name "customJsonOrderingProvider" --set json-keys:"/languages/english/years /languages/french/years" -n


After that, when we try to rebuild-index, it results in a temporary file with a very long name:


opendj/import-tmp/userRoot/_dc_com_profile_extensibleJsonEqualityMatch_caseIgnoreStrings_ignoreWhiteSpace_languages_english_years_languages_french_years_f785c891-b52b-4c28-8dc0-d56d0763b1f7


This is a big problem on encrypted file systems, as the path length is capped at 143 chars, but I can imagine there could be a problem on a normal FS as well.
