The class 

org.opends.server.extensions.ConfigFileHandler

 has been removed which was used by OpenAM to start an embedded OpenDJ instance.



        DirectoryEnvironmentConfig config = new DirectoryEnvironmentConfig();
        config.setConfigClass(ConfigFileHandler.class);



If this class was intended to be removed what is the correct way to now achieve the same goal?

The 

DirectoryEnvironmentConfig#setConfigClass

 method was removed in commit, cad7abf78a8
