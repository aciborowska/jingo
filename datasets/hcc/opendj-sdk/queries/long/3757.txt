Trying to add a new proxy-backend using dsconfig interactive is asking multiple question and then ask for the bind password. Problem is that this password is displayed clearly while i'm taping it:


..
>>>> Configuring the "proxy-password" property

    Password associated with the proxy bind DN.

    It must be the same on all the remote servers.

    Syntax:  STRING

Enter a value for the "proxy-password" property: mypasswordinclear 
..



This problem also appear at different location where passwords/pins are required.

Some propositions to solve/mitigate this with different level of security:

	have a special tag for password attribute so that dsconfig doesn't display password.
	crypt password before storing them in the config using a common key stored in one
    well-known file (configurable location)
	never accept password directly: use indirection through a property or file.
