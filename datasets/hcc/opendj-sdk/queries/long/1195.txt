We recently refactored the SDK Maven module layout in order to split out the Grizzly support. In addition we also introduced support for SLF4J.

Both of these changes require updates to our developer guide. However, to avoid unnecessary churn we should hold of making the doc changes until the "dust has settled". In particular, the role of the opendj-ldap-sdk package is unclear to me: do we need it? Should we change it into a POM module rather than an aggregate JAR?
