Hi,

Is there any way to disable an account, if the passwd is not changed in 30 days ( for example). Once you set the max-passwd-age and warning-period, the warning time will start counting only if there is an LDAP bind.

For example, the requirement is send notification email on 4th day and 5th day and disable the account on 6th day.

Password policy properties                     values     

16)  max-password-age                           3 d
21)  password-expiration-warning-interval       2 d

The email is sent on the 4th day, only if there is an LDAP bind operation from that account. No email on the next day. No clear notification on the terminal. On 6th day the passwd is expired but the account is not disabled.

Thanks,
Ravi
