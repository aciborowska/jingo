Install guide currently says http://download.forgerock.org/downloads/opendj/2.5.0/install/QuickSetup.jnlp, which is not correct (returns HTTP 404 Not Found).

At present, there's a 2.5.0-Xpress1 at http://download.forgerock.org/downloads/enterprise/opendj/2.5.0-Xpress/install/QuickSetup.jnlp

This link is temporary, and expected to change.

The best solution might be to send readers to the download pages rather than try to include full links.
