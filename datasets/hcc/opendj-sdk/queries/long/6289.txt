The current support tool only captures a gc log with a basic name based on the -Xgclog file parameter, and fails to collect rotated gc logs or logs with GC variables such as timestamps (%t) or pid numbers (%p) in them.

Assume the basic log file is named:

gc.log


	If -XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation is used the -Xloggc file created is gc.log.0.current
	If a timestamp (gc-%t.log) is added to the file then the file name is gc-2019-04-02_14-48-16.log
	If a pid (%p) is added to the file, then the created file is gc-pid817.log
