In DJ 2.6.x the userPassword syntax was 1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.3.1, in DJ 3.x and now DS 5.x the syntax is 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 - the official userPassword standard. However, an upgrade from 2.6 to any newer version does not update the syntax in the 00=core.ldif, the correct newer syntax is in the template files and on a fresh install is fine but with an upgrade the 00-core.ldif does not get updated.Â
