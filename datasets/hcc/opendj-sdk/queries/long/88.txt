While it is possible to back up and restore the config backend offline, attempts to perform such a task on-line fail as follows:

./bin/backup -h localhost -p 4444 -D cn=directory\ manager -w password -X -n config -d /tmp 
Backup task 20110307161416663 scheduled to start immediately

Backup task 20110307161416663 did not complete successfully

I suspect that the cause has something to do with our separation of public and private backends.
