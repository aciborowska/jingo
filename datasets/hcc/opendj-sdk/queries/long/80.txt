When the draft change log is used and there are many changes in the change log, the draft change log DB handler thread spins constantly trying to purge the DB even though most of the time it never succeeds since nothing has been purged. The thread should, I think, stop as soon as it discovers a record which exists in the main changelog.

Not only does this keep a CPU hot but it also causes significant IO since the DB cache for this environment is not that big.
