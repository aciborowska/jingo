With 7.0.0-SNAPSHOT rev. 045f72e67ea I found out that I can't use 0 as a value for --keepCount parameter of dsbackup purge subcommand.

The tool subcommand doc says:

--keepCount {number of backups}
    The number of backups to keep per backend. Use this option to keep the n
    latest backups of each backend and delete the others. If n=0, all the
    backups will be removed

So the value 0 should be accepted but it is not. 

When 0 is used as a value the tool reports following error:

An error occurred while parsing the command-line arguments:  
The provided value "0" for argument --keepCount is not acceptable:  
The provided keepCount value 0 is unacceptable because it is below the lower bound of 1
See "dsbackup --help" to get more usage help
