The forgerock-je.jar file included in the 4.0.0 and 3.5.2 release builds does not contain the fix:


888ef61 Make BDB JE work with Azul Zulu. Azul Systems Inc, produces 2 JVMs. Zulu which is free and based on OpenJDK and Zing which is a commercial product and has a different runtime (and alternate GC). The code was inspecting the vendor name and not differentiating Zing from Zulu, trying to call in for methods that are only in Zing. The fix is to check the runtime name and treat Zulu as a regular version of OpenJDK.



As a consequence customers cannot use the Azul Zulu JVM.

In fact it is rather unclear what version of forgerock-je.jar got included in the releases. There are no tags in the commons/forgerock-je git repository, so it looks like we effectively got a SNAPSHOT build.
