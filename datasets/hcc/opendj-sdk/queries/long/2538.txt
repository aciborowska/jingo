Found using OpenDJ 3.0.0 rev b788d2300f238000fd39ca6f0cc4b24ac211157a

In the start-ds output we have the following line:

[11/Dec/2015:13:06:28 +0100] category=CORE severity=NOTICE msgID=org.opends.messages.core.134 msg=OpenDJ 3.0.0-M7 (build 20151210193306, Rb788d2300f238000fd39ca6f0cc4b24ac211157a) starting up



=> the "R" before the git revision should be removed, seems to be part of the git revision
=> maybe we could replace it with "Rev "
