Directory : OpenDJ Server v.2.6.0 
Development Using : System Directory Services Protocol (SDSP), NET 4.0, C#
Purpose : To support OpenDJ server (Full and Delta Import scenario’s). 

I was successfully able to do Full Import i.e. read all the entries from OpenDJ with pagination when I read partition data (e.g. dc=foo,dc=com). I had used Pagination control for the same.

But when I'm trying to read External Change Log – ECL to provide for delta import from Open DJ (v.2.6.0). 

I'm not able successfully run the code as it throws Directory Operation Exception - "The server does not support the control. The control is critical."

Although the pagination control works when targeting other partitions, but why does pagination control not work with External Change Log (ECL) or even the VLV control for that matter.

VLV control returns records according to the query but it too brings in more number of records than asked for. Is there any way to read change log through VLV or Pagination control with pagination support ?

Please let me know if I’m doing something wrong or is there any way for ECL to support pagination (are there any additional configuration required)? 
This is the main issue which we are facing with OpenDJ directory server. 

Please find the code snippet attached for Page and VLV control.
