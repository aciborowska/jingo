Because SaslClient instance is set in the BindRequest, if this BindRequest is set as a AUTHN_BIND_REQUEST option for LdapClient, this same SaslClient instance will be used for all the connection opened by this LdapClient.
This cause problem during concurrent Bind on different connection. Its even worst when QoP is used.

A solution could be to transform AUTHN_BIND_REQUEST so that it acts as a factory.
