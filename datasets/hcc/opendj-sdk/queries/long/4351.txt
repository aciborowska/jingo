Imagine we have scenario with one proxy-server and one directory-server behind this proxy.

On the directory-server a global property trust-transaction-ids is set to true and on proxy the same property is set to false. 

In our test we do a search request with transaction id equal to 2222. 


At the moment with 5.5.0 rev  93cbd1d01df,  I can see same transaction id in proxy log and transaction id 2222/0 in logs of directory-server.

The expected behavior is different. I expect to see a new randomly generated transaction id (UUID format) in proxy logs and in log of directory server I expect same UUID with "/0" suffix.
