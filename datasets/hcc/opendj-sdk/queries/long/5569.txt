RFC 2891 states:


3 - If the server supports this sorting control but for some reason
cannot sort the search results using the specified sort keys and
the client specified TRUE for the control's criticality field,
then the server SHOULD do the following: return
unavailableCriticalExtension as a return code in the
searchResultDone message; include the sortKeyResponseControl in
the searchResultDone message, and not send back any search result
entries.

As a consequence, for a crititical ServerSideSortRequestControl with an unparseable attribute type, DS should return UNAVAILABLE_CRITICAL_EXTENSION result code for the search operation.
