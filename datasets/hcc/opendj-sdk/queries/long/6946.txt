The Windows native binaries fail to build using Visual Studio 2013 since the changes to address OPENDJ-6367 and OPENDJ-6376.

The main problem is that snprintf() and mkdir() are not recognized library functions. We need to use _ variants, i.e. _snprintf()Â and _mkdir(). Also _mkdir() is declared in <direct.h> which should be included.

We will need to carefully check the semantics of _snprintf() are as we expect, e.g. with regards to NUL termination and return values.

Later version of the Visual Studio runtime appear to have improved (or at least changed) these library functions, so we could also consider upgrading. However some experimentation with VS 2019 community edition suggests that the mt, mc and rc tools are not present, so upgrading would require some additional work. Perhaps these tools are provided in the non-community "Pro" version.
