If a client disconnects from the server having configured the TCP socket to use an SO_LINGER value of 0 then the server logs the following misleading message which suggests that the client sent a malformed LDAP message:

[06/Oct/2011:11:36:23 +0200] DISCONNECT conn=303 reason="Protocol Error" msg="The client sent a request to the Directory Server that could not be properly decoded as an LDAP message:  java.io.IOException: Connection reset by peer"

Attached is a sample Java app which exposes this problem.
