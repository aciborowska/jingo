Found using dev branch in revision 11330.

Scenario:
************
1. setup the server

2. run dsconfig with an invalid parameter value

$ ./opendj-inst1/opendj/bin/dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D cn=myself -w password -X set-connection-handler-prop --handler-name "wrong_handler"

$ echo $?
1



=> in that case we should have an error to indicate that the parameter value is wrong, like in trunk version:

Unable to continue since there are no "wrong_handler" currently configured on the server



3. or run dsconfig with invalid parameter

$ ./opendj-inst1/opendj/bin/dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D cn=myself -w password -X set-connection-handler-prop --handler-name 'SNMP Connection Handler' --set registered -n
The property argument "registered" does not contain a name/value separator.
The argument should have the following syntax: property:value
$ echo $?
1
$ ./opendj-inst1/opendj/bin/dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D cn=myself -w password -X set-connection-handler-prop --handler-name 'SNMP Connection Handler' --set registered -n 1>/dev/null
$



=> in that case the error message is displayed but should be displayed on stderr instead of stdout

4. another case in which the error message has changed

The Replication Domain could not be modified because of the following reason:

    *  Unwilling to Perform: Entry cn=o=example,cn=domains,cn=Multimaster
       Synchronization,cn=Synchronization Providers,cn=config cannot be
       modified because one of the configuration change listeners registered
       for that entry rejected the change: Wrong fractional replication
       configuration : cannot use both exclusive and inclusive modes


compare to trunk message:

The Replication Domain could not be modified because of the following reason:

    *  [LDAP: error code 53 - Entry cn=o=example,cn=domains,cn=Multimaster
       Synchronization,cn=Synchronization Providers,cn=config cannot be
       modified because one of the configuration change listeners registered
       for that entry rejected the change:  Wrong fractional replication
       configuration : cannot use both exclusive and inclusive modes]



=> is this change expected?
