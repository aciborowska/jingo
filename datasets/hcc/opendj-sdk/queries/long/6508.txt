Prometheus has a precise definition for job and instance: https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/jobs_instances/ .

The monitoring dashboard of DS uses job where instance should be used.
This can be problematic when multiple DS services are deployed (ctsstore, userstore, etc.) and we are only interested in one service only. Such deployments can happen with forgeops for example.

It would be nice to be able to filter independently the service from the instance.
