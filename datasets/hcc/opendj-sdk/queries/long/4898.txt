A customer is seeing this logging in 5.5.0:

[15/Mar/2018:10:23:20 -0400] ABANDON REQ conn=65339 op=1 msgID=2 idToAbandon=1 
[15/Mar/2018:10:23:20 -0400] DISCONNECT conn=65339 reason="Server Error" msg="An unexpected failure occurred while trying to process a request of type ABANDON (LDAP message ID 2): org.opends.server.types.DirectoryException: A bind operation is currently in progress on the associated client connection. No other requests may be made on this client connection until the bind processing has completed. The client connection will be terminated"

We think msgID 1 is the BIND REQ.

There are two problems here.

First is that we should not be including the exception name in the error text, as that leaks implementation information.

More subtly, we should actually just ignore that abandon operation and not return an error. RFC 4511 4.11 Abandon Operation says:
Abandon, Bind, Unbind, and StartTLS operations cannot be abandoned.
[...]
Servers MUST discard Abandon requests for messageIDs they do not recognize, for operations that cannot be abandoned, and for operations that have already been abandoned.
Our LdapClientConnection.handleRequest() just rejects all operations if a bind is in progress.
