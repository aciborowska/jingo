Discovered with functional setup tests.

When we install DJ without --productionMode, we can still see patch_to_secure_config.ldif  under /path/to/opendj/config/ folder after setup finished


setup directory-server -h localhost -p 1394 -D "cn=myself" -w password --adminConnectorPort 4449 -Z 1641 -b dc=com -t je  -O



I expect some cleanup of this file as same as when we do setup with --productionMode argument.
