As a consequence of migration of matching rules to SDK, the methods isXMatchingRule(MatchingRule) where X=(Equality, Ordering, ...) in org.opends.guitools.controlpanel.util.Utilities class are broken because there is no way to determine the type of matching rule. They currently return false.

It means that matching rule are not displayed correctly in the UIs using these methods.

Suggested options:

	Avoid categorizing the matching rules at all and simply have a single drop down list to select from (sorting will help group related rules)
	Categorize the matching rules using some naming heuristics, e.g. if the matching rule name contains "ordering" or "equality", etc. Note that this option is not 100% exact because naming is not fully consistent with this approach.
