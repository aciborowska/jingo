Now that the SambaPasswordPlugin has been integrated into OpenDJ (OpenDJ-233) we need to integrate Nemanja's patch to support dn: and u: authid notation for password modify extended operation.

In order avoid code duplication we should implementation a mechanism whereby the password modify extended operation implementation can store the DN of the modified entry for post-op plugins to access.
