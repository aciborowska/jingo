When using dsconfig in interactive mode to configure theÂ excluded-metric-pattern property, the help message is talking about Graphite instead of Prometheus/Grafana:
Zero or more regular expressions identifying metrics that should not be
 published to the Graphite server. The metric name prefix must not be
 included in the filter. Exclusion patterns take precedence over inclusion
 patterns.
