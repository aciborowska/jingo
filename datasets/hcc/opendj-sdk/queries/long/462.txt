Radiant Logic noticed that org.opends.server.backends.jeb.importLDIF.Importer.ScratchFileWriterTask.call() is using a spinning poll() instead of a blocking take() in order to obtain items of its work queue. This needlessly consumes CPU cycles and prevents other threads from making progress, as well as impacting server performance when an import is performed online.
