This problem appeared between revision 9785 and revision 9788.

All the replication/conflict functional tests are failing.

Here the detail of one testcase ('double_replace_multi'):
1. create 2 instances
2. enable replication between these two instances
3. add an entry on instance1 with description:
{1 2}
4. disable replication (disconnect replication servers)
5. replace description->
{3 4} on instance1
6. replace description->{5 6} on instance2
7. enable replication (re-connect replication servers)
8. check description={5 6} on both servers
9. check servers are synchronized

After re-enabling (step 7), the servers are not synchronized.
- on instance1: description={3 4}

	on instance2: description=
{5 6}



In attachment a shell script to reproduce this problem.
