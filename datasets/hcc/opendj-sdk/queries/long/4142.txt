When opendj/bin/control-panel is launched locally and connected to a remote DJ instance, errors are thrown, even after controlling for DJ and JDK versions.

"Error reading configuration" on the main panel. (see error_reading_config.png)
 "Could not find schema" on Schema => Manage Schema panel. (schema_not_found.png)

No errors are thrown in the terminal window or DJ logs. The only difference I saw in the access logs is that the remote session performs a (successful) search for version info under cn=monitor.

To reproduce:

	Deploy two DJ 5 instances. This can be done on the same host
dj1 LDAP: 1389
     Admin: 4444
dj2 LDAP: 2389
     Admin: 5444
	Launch dj2/bin/control-panel
	Connect to dj1:4444
"Error reading configuration" appears at the top of the main window.
	Click Schema => Manage Schema
"Could not find schema" error appears in Manage Schema panel
