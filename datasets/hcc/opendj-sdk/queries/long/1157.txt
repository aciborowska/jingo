When you try to run start-ds (or tools) on a non configured server, following message is displayed :


./bin/start-ds 
The Directory Server could not acquire an exclusive lock 
on file /home/OpenDJ-2.7.0/locks/server.lock:  
The attempt to obtain an exclusive lock on file /home/OpenDJ-2.7.0/locks/server.lock 
was rejected because the attempt to create the lock file failed:
IOException(No such file or directory).  
This generally means that another instance of this server is already running



Or


./bin/control-panel 
The version of the installed OpenDJ could not be determined because the
version file '/home/OpenDJ-2.7.0/config/buildinfo' could not be
found. Restore it from backup before continuing



The message should explain to the user than the server is not yet configured / installed. (remove IOException too).
