I noticed that after upgrade from version 3.0.0 to latest snapshot of 6.5.0 rev. cc6082ea9b3 we are missing a new object class ds-cfg-common-audit-access-log-publisher which should be added during an upgrade process to config.ldif.

During implementation of the test case for this scenario I used version 5.5.0 and the test was ok.

Command to reproduce this issue (name of test is post_add_filtered_json_access_logger):


export OPENDJ_PREVIOUS_VERSION=3.0.0
./configure.py -s -f
./run-pybot.py -s upgrade_group.upgradeTasks -v dj
