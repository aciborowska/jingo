In pyforge test proxy_psearch_failover it appears that the proxy is now returning SUCCESS (0) for the persistent search once this one is ended because the DS where it has been routed is shut-down.

It's still not clear whether this SUCCESS (0) is initiated by DS or by the Proxy.

From a first investigation it seems that DS, when shutdown, should send an UNAVAILABLE (52) on all active psearch. Still, it seems that, until now, a CLIENT_SIDE_SERVER_DOWN (81) was erroneously expected.

Acceptance criteria: 

	DS returns 52 UNAVAILABLE to psearches which are active at the time of the shutdown
	Proxy forwards this 52 UNAVAILABLE up to the end client.
	The proxy_psearch_failover test is modified to expect (52) UNAVAILABLE
