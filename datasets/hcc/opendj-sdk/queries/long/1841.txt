The alert type, ALERT_TYPE_ACCESS_CONTROL_PARSE_FAILED, includes a typo, authentiation.

See http://sources.forgerock.org/browse/~br=trunk/opendj/trunk/opendj/opendj-server-legacy/src/main/java/org/opends/server/util/ServerConstants.java?hb=true#to1773.

If we fix the typo, we should mention the change both in the body of the docs and also in the compatibility section of the release notes.
