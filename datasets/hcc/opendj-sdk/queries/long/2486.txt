	Scenario:
	
		Install server with enabling LDAPS port.
		Create filtering criteria with connection-port-equal-to and log-record-type properties:

dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X create-access-log-filtering-criteria --publisher-name "Common Audit Csv File Access Logger" --criteria-name "TEST CRITERION" --set connection-port-equal-to:1389 --set log-record-type:CONNECT -n


	
	




	
	
		Set filtering-policy to exclusive and enable the publisher

dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X set-log-publisher-prop --set filtering-policy:exclusive --publisher-name "Common Audit Csv File Access Logger" --set enabled:true --set csv-delimiter-char:# -n


	
	




	
	
		Than do an ldapsearch on LDAPS port.
		After that I noticed following message in a ldap-access.csv file:

"6b2102f1-bfcb-4600-bc01-70455dca0d36-121"#"2015-11-26T12:37:13.488Z"#"DJ-LDAPS-CONNECT"#"0"###"127.0.0.1"#"1636"#"null"#"127.0.0.1"#"58340"#"LDAPS"#"CONNECT"#"SUCCESSFUL"#"0"##"0"#"MILLISECONDS"#"18"#########################


	
	



From configuration reference definition of exclusive: 
Records must not match any of the filtering criteria in order to be logged.

From my point of view it matches record-type ("request.operation" in *.csv format)  "CONNECT"  and because of that I think it should not be in the file.

I didn't test more complicated filters, but I think the problem is more general. I think the exclusive filter is evaluated in a wrong way, looks like it takes all criteria and only if all of them are in MESSAGE the message is not logged, otherwise it is logged. (Which does not match the definition from my point of view).  I also did an ldapsearch on LDAP port (1389) and I didn't notice any CONNECT message in csv log.
