The system setup is described in the attached PNG. The Virtual Directory is provided by Optimal IdM. When I try to do a PTA against one of the virtual directories (load balanced), I get an error that says:

[19/Sep/2013:09:49:52 +0200] CONNECT conn=41 from=127.0.0.1:60391 to=127.0.0.1:389 protocol=LDAP

The unexpected response message was: BindResponse(resultCode=0)" etime=2282
[19/Sep/2013:09:49:54 +0200] DISCONNECT conn=41 reason="Client Disconnect"

Now, I tried doing an ldapsearch from console to the system (I use mapping-policy:mapped-search for the password-policy I configured) using the same mapped-search-bind-dn and passwort I supplied to the password policy and I do get a result when searching for an attribute of the desired user, however, before the result is printed to the console, I get a message that reads:

Invalid operation type returned in search result 97

Maybe this can also help. It seems to indicate that the client receives referrals from the server (that was Ludovics suggestion, I have already talked to him about that on the IRC channel), but I could not validate that because I don't know where to look for that.

I will gladly provide more information should it be required.
