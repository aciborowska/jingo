Rob reports the following test case:


	perform search with sizelimit of 200 over a large number of matching entries
	before receiving 200 search results, return false from handleEntry()
	handleError is still invoked when the sizelimit is exceeded.



It's unclear to me what we should do once the handler implementation returns false. Should we:


	stop all further notifications, including result and/or error?
	immediately notify SUCCESS and throw away all subsequent messages?
	or, immediately notify with an error like "client cancelled" and throw away all subsequent messages?



It is clear to me that the current behavior is wrong.
