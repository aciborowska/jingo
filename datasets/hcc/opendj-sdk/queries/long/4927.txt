In stress test I noticed a degradation of performance of addrate tool. The decrease hit a limit of 5% we have in tests and it's around 10%.

Scenario

Two sets of servers:

	5.5.0 (2 servers in DSRS mode)
	6.0.0-SNAPSHOT (2 servers in DSRS mode)



With each set of servers we run following steps:

	setup servers and enable replication between them
	addÂ 160000 entries
	run addrate:
	
./addrate -h pyforge.example.com -p 1390 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -d 1800 -S -F -B 60 -c 30 -i 18 -C fifo /tmp/addrate.template




At the end we check we didn't hit any error and check the average throughput of both sets:

	At this point we hit the problem, because the average throughput difference is higher then 5%.
	
Average throughput 1235.100000 for version 6.0.0-SNAPSHOT is lower than average throughput 1396.900000 of version 5.5.0





There is also a stress test to reproduce, but it should be run on a lab machine.

./run-pybot.py -v -c perf -s perf_comparison.OperationsComparison -t AddDelRate_DefaultIndexes OpenDJJ
