Since commit 5575ef4b406, ssl-cert-nickname property is no longer mandatory for Administration Connector and Replication Synchronization Provider configuration elements.

As a consequence, the user can use dsconfig to reset the property to its default value (which lets the server decide which SSL key-pair should be used). Unfortunately, this does not work:

$ bin/dsconfig  set-administration-connector-prop  \
                                --reset ssl-cert-nickname \
                                --hostname localhost \
                               --port 4444 \
                               --bindDn uid=admin \
                               --bindPassword password \
                               --trustAll \
                                --no-prompt

Object Class Violation: Entry cn=Administration Connector,cn=config cannot be
modified because the resulting entry would have violated the server schema:
Entry "cn=Administration Connector,cn=config" violates the schema because it
does not contain attribute "ds-cfg-ssl-cert-nickname" which is required by
object class "ds-cfg-administration-connector"

$ bin/dsconfig set-synchronization-provider-prop \
                               --provider-name "Multimaster Synchronization" \
                               --reset ssl-cert-nickname \
                               --hostname localhost \
                               --port 4444 \
                               --bindDn uid=admin \
                               --bindPassword password \
                               --trustAll \
                                --no-prompt
Object Class Violation: Entry cn=Multimaster
Synchronization,cn=Synchronization Providers,cn=config cannot be modified
because the resulting entry would have violated the server schema: Entry
"cn=Multimaster Synchronization,cn=Synchronization Providers,cn=config"
violates the schema because it does not contain attribute
"ds-cfg-ssl-cert-nickname" which is required by object class
"ds-cfg-replication-synchronization-provider"


This bug can be closed once configuration schema will be have been updated to reflect changes made in commit mentioned above.
