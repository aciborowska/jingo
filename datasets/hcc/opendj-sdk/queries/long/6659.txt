Discovered with 7.0.0-SNAPSHOT rev. 78ad526e799 

To reproduce the issue:


python3 run-pybot.py -v -s logging_group.publisher_properties.loggingRetention -t count_limit_retention_legacy OpenDJ





Steps to reproduce:
1. setup server
2. create new file count policy

dsconfig -h pyforge.example.com -p 4445 -D "uid=admin" -w password -X create-log-retention-policy --policy-name "my file count retention policy" --type file-count --set number-of-files:5 -n


3. create new size limit policy

dsconfig -h pyforge.example.com -p 4445 -D "uid=admin" -w password -X create-log-rotation-policy --policy-name "my size Limit Rotation Policy" --type size-limit --set file-size-limit:2kb -n


4. set policies to log publisher

dsconfig -h pyforge.example.com -p 4445 -D "uid=admin" -w password -X set-log-publisher-prop --publisher-name "File-Based Access Logger" --set enabled:true --set append:true --set auto-flush:true --set asynchronous:false --set log-format:multi-line --set append:true --set retention-policy:"my file count retention policy" --set rotation-policy:"my size Limit Rotation Policy" -n


5. do ldapsearches for a while and check logs directory

Current behavior:
After step 5. I can see more than 5 (access*) files in the logs directory. This is regression because same test was working fine before.
The searches rate aren't aggressive, the test is doing 1 search in 10 seconds and after it checks the log files. 
When I was checking this manually I also tried to restart the server and do few more searches and I ended with 9 access log files.

Expected behavior:
I expected what was the behavior before this regression.  That is the policy is applied and working and should delete files when the file count is greater than the configured value.
