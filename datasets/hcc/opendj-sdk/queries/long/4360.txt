When a logger is deleted, it does not unregister to log publisher changes, see:
 AbstractLogger.applyConfigurationDelete(). This will keep unused loggers in memory. 

When a logger is added, it registers to changes with LogPublisherCfg.addChangeListener(), see: AbstractLogger.initializeLogger() 

When being deleted, it is supposed to unregister with a call to LogPublisherCfg.removeChangeListener().
