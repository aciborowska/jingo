When running rate tools, if tool failed to get new connections, an error message is printed when a new connection failed.
Thus, we see a lot of error message (as much as we have connections in fact).
To reproduce on Linux, change your TCP settings as follow:

$ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle=0
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 0
$ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=0
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 0



Then the following command should failed as follow:

$ bin/searchrate -p 1389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w p -c 32 -t 1 -s base -d 600 -b "uid=user.%d,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" -g "rand(0,9)" "(objectclass=*)"

As a side note, It might also be worth if the stats could be not printed after that errors occured.
