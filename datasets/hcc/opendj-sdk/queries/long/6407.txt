It is difficult and time consuming to diagnose why SSL connections are failed by DJ. One common problem is the server is "hardened" and is only prepared to support TLSv1.2, and the client then continues to try TLSv1.0.

This used to be easier to diagnose. Using openssl as a test client:


openssl s_client -tls1 -connect acheron.local:636
openssl s_client -tls1_1 -connect acheron.local:636
openssl s_client -tls1_2 -connect acheron.local:636



Prior to DS 5.0.0, our access logs were pretty clear:


[27/Jun/2019:16:15:25 +0100] CONNECT conn=2 from=127.0.0.1:56886 to=127.0.0.1:636 protocol=LDAPS
[27/Jun/2019:16:15:25 +0100] DISCONNECT conn=2 reason="I/O Error" msg="An IO error occurred while reading a request from the client: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Client requested protocol TLSv1 not enabled or not supported"
[27/Jun/2019:16:15:30 +0100] CONNECT conn=3 from=127.0.0.1:56887 to=127.0.0.1:636 protocol=LDAPS
[27/Jun/2019:16:15:30 +0100] DISCONNECT conn=3 reason="I/O Error" msg="An IO error occurred while reading a request from the client: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Client requested protocol TLSv1.1 not enabled or not supported"
[27/Jun/2019:16:15:34 +0100] CONNECT conn=4 from=127.0.0.1:56888 to=127.0.0.1:636 protocol=LDAPS
[27/Jun/2019:16:15:41 +0100] DISCONNECT conn=4 reason="Client Disconnect"



Doing the same tests in DS 5.0.0 or above gives us a "Protocol error".

It would be helpful if we could restore the old msg content in the logs.
