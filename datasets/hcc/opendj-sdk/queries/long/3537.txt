*Given*
A fresh opendj archive and the OPENDJ_JAVA_ARGS set to -Dorg.forgerock.opendj.gendoc=true
*When*
Trying to generate the xml ref entries for a tool which support sub commands, such as:

bin/dsconfig --help


Note that you need to add the freemarker jar to make this works, otherwise you'll got a NoClassDefFoundError
*Then*
The system property is ignored and the tool prints user friendly help text in standard output.

The issue is located in the SubCommandArgumentParser#parseArguments() method which calls different getUsage(...) methods whether the help argument is '?', 'H' or '-help'.
The only one which works at the moment is '?'.
