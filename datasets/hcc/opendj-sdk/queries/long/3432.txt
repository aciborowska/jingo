I have used command 

make-ldif -t /opt/pyforge/PyBot/OpenIDM/testcases/data/idm/idm_sample2_example.template -o /tmp/users.ldif -c numusers=10000000

and I got message

sh: 0: getcwd() failed: No such file or directory
An error occurred while parsing the command-line arguments:  The argument -c
was included multiple times in the provided set of arguments but it does not
allow multiple values

See "make-ldif --help" to get more usage help


When removed that single -c parameter it worked as expected.

I know that -c parameter is allowed only for SDK variant - makeldif, but it was very confusing and took me some time before I realized what's wrong.

It looks like make-ldif uses SDK's makeldif with -c parameter.

I would expect message like "Parameter -c is not one of the allowed parameters."
