During DJ startup, the GroupManager perform a request to fetch and cache the list of all groups present in the backend.

Problem is that this request can takes a long time to respond in the case where the number of groups reach the objectClass index entry limit. This cause the search to be unindexed and dependent of the number of entries in the backend.
