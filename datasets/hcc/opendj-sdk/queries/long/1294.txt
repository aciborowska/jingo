ldap tools take a DN and a password to authenticate users, with the options -D <DN> and -w <password> or -j <passwordfile>.
The -D option requires either -w or -j.
Most of the tools accept -w - as way to say read password from stdin (avoiding cleartext password appearing on the command line and/or ps). But this option doesn't work for ldappasswordmodify tool.
Code to deal with that specific case is actually missing.
