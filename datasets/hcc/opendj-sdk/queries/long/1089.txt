Steps to reproduce :
1. Create a Back end  "userRoot"
2. Create a Base DN "dc=example,dc=com"
3. Add user to this Base dn "aaa"
4. Delete Base DN using Menu "Entries" --> "Delete Base DN"
5. Create base DN with same name "dc=example,dc=com" with Back end "userRoot"

Result:
Base DN gets created with user "aaa".

My debug points :
if there is only one Base Dn for a Back End  
step 4 in "Steps to reproduce" is trying to delete Back End directly but not deleting sub entries of Back End.

if i have more then one Base DN in a Back End i don't see this issue as 
step 4 in "Steps to reproduce"  is deleting Base DN and all its sub entries .

So this problem can also be reproduced by deleting Back End with one Base DN and recreating the Base DN.

Conclusion:
Deleting of Back End should also delete its sub entries .
