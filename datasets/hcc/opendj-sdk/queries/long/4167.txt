Found using OpenDJ 4.1.0 (rev f52898e2250)

The same test was passed with 4.1.0-SNAPSHOT (2f66c2f5ad2)

Scenario
1. setup and start a server

2. stop the server

3. call status command with credentials

$ ./DJ1/opendj/bin/status -D 'cn=Directory Manager' -w password -X -n
Unable to connect to the server at "mactof.local" on port 4444



=> this behavior has changed compared to 4.0.0 in which we got the server info (except number of entries,...)
=> this can be discuss as this new bahavior make sense to me

4. call status command without credentials

$ ./DJ1/opendj/bin/status


>>>> Specify OpenDJ LDAP connection parameters

How do you want to trust the server certificate?

    1)  Automatically trust
    2)  Use a truststore
    3)  Manually validate

Enter choice [3]:

Administrator user bind DN [cn=Directory Manager]:
...



=> here status should not prompt for credential and should return server infos (except number of entries,...)
