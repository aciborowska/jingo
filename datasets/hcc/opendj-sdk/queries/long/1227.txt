While investigating OPENDJ-1079 I found that class loading errors were not being propagated up the stack. I fixed this, but then found that the errors were not logged anywhere.

There are two issues:


	the class loading error is lost about 4 "causes" down in the ConfigException that is logged in the error log. As a result a message which is too generic is logged (see OPENDJ-1079)




	enabling the debug logger does not help because it appears that DebugTracers, once initialized, do not take into consideration subsequent changes to the debug log configuration. In particular, the DirectoryServer class and most of the admin framework is initialized before debug loggers are even loaded!
