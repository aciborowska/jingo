To install a server in split mode you need to write a path, where the OpenDJ should be installed, to instance.loc file, which is by default in the archive.

I noticed that during split mode installation the license is not displayed. This is different behavior compared to default non-split installation.

Steps:

cd /path/to/opendj/archive
unzip OpenDJ-2.6.4.zip
echo `pwd`/instance > opendj/instance.loc
./opendj/setup --cli
