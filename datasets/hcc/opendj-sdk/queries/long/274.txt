This issue was reported by a customer who had a single valued attribute with 2 values.
On the server which received the modification, the value was correct. But on the replica, the single valued attribute had 2 values.

Trying to reproduce this issue, I discovered that the code dealing with reconciliation of modifications did not properly cover the case where multiple modifications where done on the same attribute with the same ChangeNumber. Especially the sequence replace - delete - add. Or add - delete - add.

$ bin/ldapmodify -p 1389 -D cn=directory\ manager -w secret12dn: uid=user.1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
replace: displayName
displayName: INACTIVE
-
delete: displayName
displayName: INACTIVE
-
add: displayName
displayName: ACTIVE

Processing MODIFY request for uid=user.1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
MODIFY operation successful for DN uid=user.1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

On the first server value is ACTIVE but on replica the value was INACTIVE.
