The upgrade procedure is the following:
1. stop server
2. unpack the OpenDJ package over the top of the existing installation
3. run upgrade tool
4. restart server

Between step 2 and 3, the following tools should work:

	encode-password
	ldifmodify
	ldifsearch
	make-ldif



But currently these tools fails with the following error:
An error occurred while trying to load the Directory Server schema: An error occurred at or near line 1848 while trying to parse the configuration from LDIF file /home/testuser/jenkins/workspace/OpenDJ-Trunk-Robot-Functional-Tests-Linux-64-bit/temp/opendj-inst1/OpenDJ-2.4.5/config/config.ldif: org.opends.server.util.LDIFException: Entry cn=Directory Manager,cn=Root DNs,cn=config read from LDIF starting at line 1848 is not valid because it violates the server's schema configuration: Entry cn=Directory Manager,cn=Root DNs,cn=config violates the Directory Server schema configuration because it contains an unknown objectclass inetOrgPerson
