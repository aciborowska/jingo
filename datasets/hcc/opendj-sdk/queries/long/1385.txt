Found on opendj3-server-dev branch (r10576).

According to issue OPENDJ-1317:

default-debug-exceptions-only is a new property : if false, everything is logged, otherwise only log with exceptions are logged 

But when we try to get/set this property, we get the following error:

$ ./opendj/bin/dsconfig set-log-publisher-prop --publisher-name "File-Based Debug Logger" --set default-debug-exceptions-only:false -h localhost -p 1444 -D "cn=myself" -w "password" -n -X 
The property "default-debug-exceptions-only" is not a recognized property of File Based Debug Log Publishers
