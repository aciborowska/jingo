Steps to reproduce:


	set up a proxy distributing across 2 backend servers using the affinity algorithm
	set a partition DN of ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
	perform search rate against entry above partition DN:

 ./bin/searchrate -h localhost -p 3389 -D uid=bjensen,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com -w hifalutin -b dc=example,dc=com -F -c 4 -t 4 -g "rand(names.txt)" "(uid=%s)"


	observe all requests going to a single server. Expectation is that searches outside the scope of the partition DN should be routed at random.
