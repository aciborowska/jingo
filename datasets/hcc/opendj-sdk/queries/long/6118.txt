The --offline option of the backup tool is misleading. The option just mandate the backup to be performed on the local DS instance, and doesn't require the server to be stopped. Proposal for change: deprecate the --offline option and keep it as a hidden option for backward compatibility.

As opposed to backup, the restore --offline command requires the server to be stopped. As such, the wording is not misleading. However it is probably a good idea to deprecate the option as well to avoid the following pattern:


$ backup --backupDirectory bak --backupAll
$ restore --offline --backupDirectory bak --restoreAl
