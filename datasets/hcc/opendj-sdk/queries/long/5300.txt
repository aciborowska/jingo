Restore does not delete its temporary backup directories at the end of the restore process.

Reproduce case:

$ bin/backup -d ~/deploy/bak/adminRoot -n adminRoot --offline
$ bin/restore -d ~/deploy/bak/adminRoot/ --offline
$ ls db
adminRoot            adminRoot.save1
Â 

adminRoot.save1 is a temporary backup and should have been removed at the end of the restore process.
 Note: we have the same problem for online restore.
Note: we have the same problem for any backend.
