Found by accident while working on OPENDJ-5865 resolution.

Configurations for:


	HTTP OAuth2 OpenAM Authorization Mechanism (HttpOauth2OpenamAuthorizationMechanismConfiguration.xml)
	HTTP OAuth2 Token Introspection (RFC 7662) Authorization Mechanism (HttpOauth2TokenIntrospectionAuthorizationMechanismConfiguration.xml)



allow user to specify a key manager provider which is used in SSL options computation while connecting to AM server or token introspection endpoint.
But the configuration is missing the ssl-cert-nickname property which allows a user to choose which certificate the server should present to authenticate to the remote server.

Acceptance criteria:
This bug should be solved once HttpOauth2OpenamAuthorizationMechanismConfiguration.xml and HttpOauth2TokenIntrospectionAuthorizationMechanismConfiguration.xml will have been updated to contain an optional ssl-cert-nickname property and the code updated to take into account the configuration update.
