When upgrading embedded DJ 3.0 to 3.5 (OpenAM 13 > 13.5), if the BaseDN is anything other than "dc=openam,dc=forgerock,dc=org", the upgrade will fail due to the BaseDN being hardcoded in:

<openam_deployment_dir>/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/template/ldif/opendj/opendj_aci_lift_user_password_restriction.ldif

<openam_deployment_dir>/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/template/ldif/opendj/opendj_aci_remove_blanket_deny_all.ldif

Expectation:
As the BaseDN can be changed, this should not be hardcoded.

Workaround is to amend BaseDN in above files pre-upgrade.
