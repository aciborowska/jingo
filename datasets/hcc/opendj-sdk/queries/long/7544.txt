Since this week-end runs, (so i guess since OPENDJ-7494 was fixed)

We are seeing here and there some error messages in errors log when using dsconfig on a started server, mostly happening on windows:

E:\jenkins\workspace\OpenDJ-7.1.x\tests_daily\Configs\results\20201005-065144\security_group\AdminConnectorConfig\DJ_SSL\opendj\bat\dsconfig.bat -h dj-sustaining-win2008r2.internal.forgerock.com -p 4447 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X set-global-configuration-prop --reset unauthenticated-requests-policy -n

Make sure the two replicas are configured with different server IDs



We have seen that for instance running:

./run-pybot.py -s security_group.AdminConnectorConfig opendj
