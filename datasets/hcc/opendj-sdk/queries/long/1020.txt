The following command never stops running:

$ bin/modrate -p 1500 -D "cn=directory manager" -w admin --noRebind --numConnections 4 --numThreads 4      -b "uid=user.%d,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" --maxIterations 1 --argument "inc(0,4)" --argument "randstr(16)" 'description:%2$s'


This is due to the following line of code:

package com.forgerock.opendj.ldap.tools;
...
abstract class PerformanceRunner implements ConnectionEventListener {
...
    public final void validate() throws ArgumentException {
...
        maxIterations = maxIterationsArgument.getIntValue() / numConnections / numThreads;


So in this case, maxIterations end up being equal to 0, a.k.a. unlimited.
As a user I would expect that only 1 iteration is done.

Likewise, 1000 max iterations with 4 connections and 4 threads ends up with 62 maxIterations per thread, i.e. 62*4*4=992 total iterations which is quite surprising for a user.
--maxIterations should account for the total number of iterations in the tool, not an approximate number of iterations per thread.
