After changing the index entry limit on an index, the only case where we can continue to use the index is when the new limit is less or equal than
the previous value, otherwise a re-index is needed.
Instead, any change to the entry limit seems to still use the inde, as can be seen from logs/access.
To Reproduce:

	install DJ with at least 10K entries
	run a search on for example substring (mail=*er.999*)
	not the search as indexed in logs/access.
	change entry limit for mail to 6000, for example
	rerun the search, the log will still show indexed search.
Moreover restarting the server will not say anything about the index being degraded.
