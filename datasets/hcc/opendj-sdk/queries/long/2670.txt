In our non-regression test suites, we have a suite for dsconfig which sets up a server then request some matching rule properties.

It fails with a message that Matching rule does not exist.

For instance:


 ./opendj/bin/dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -X get-matching-rule-prop --rule-name "Auth Password Exact Equality Matching Rule" --advanced -n

The Matching Rule does not exist
