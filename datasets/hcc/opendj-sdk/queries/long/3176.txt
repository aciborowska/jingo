Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 and OpenDJ 3.5.0 RC1.

This problem occurs only on Windows.
When the path to opendmk jar file or security file is not correct we should have an error message when the server starts (or server.out) but we have currently no error message.

NOTE: the error message appears correctly in the 'logs/errors' file.
