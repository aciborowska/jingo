Steps to reproduce:

	modify the Dockerfile in opendj-ldapaas/common/docker/Dockerfile to install the ds-evaluation profile
	follow the instructions in the README.md to deploy a 3 way topology
	although the DS containers start there are many errors in the logs and the data cannot be accessed.



There are a number of problems that should be addressed:

	the ds-evaluation profile should not be encrypting data
	the ds-empty Docker image does not support encrypted data added during Docker build when the run-time master-key is different to the master-key used during the build
	the DS containers appear to have started but are unusable.



This bug will address the first item above. It appears that setup-profile always creates backends with encryption enabled. The profile should decide whether encryption is enabled or not.

This issue is related to OPENDJ-5982 (removal of production mode). It may be better to resolve this issue as a side-effect of fixing OPENDJ-5982.
