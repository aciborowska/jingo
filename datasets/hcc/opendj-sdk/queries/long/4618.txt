Checking the release notes of the latest version of BDB JE, it is important to set an explicit JVM argument to enable compressedOops with 64bits JVMs.
To take full advantage of JE cache memory, it is strongly recommended that compressed oops (-XX:+UseCompressedOops) is specified when a 64-bit JVM is used and the maximum heap size is less than 32 GB. As described in the referenced documentation, compressed oops is sometimes the default JVM mode even when it is not explicitly specified in the Java command. However, if compressed oops is desired then it must be explicitly specified in the Java command when running DbCacheSize or a JE application. If it is not explicitly specified then JE will not aware of it, even if it is the JVM default setting, and will not take it into account when calculating cache memory sizes.

We should highlight this early in the documentation,  in the Installation chapter.
