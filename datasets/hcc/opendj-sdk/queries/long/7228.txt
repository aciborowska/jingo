With 7.0.0-SNAPSHOT rev. e37854dea46 and with mysql server version 8 we are unable to use the example directly. 

In the test we hit an issue with syntax on line:

ProgrammingError: (1064, "You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'IDENTIFIED BY 'root'' at line 4")

It is this line:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on audit.* TO audit IDENTIFIED BY 'root';

This file should be updated to handle the syntax.
