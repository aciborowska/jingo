Steps to reproduce:
1. Setup a standard directory server instance:

$ /path/to/opendj/setup directory-server \
          --rootUserDn cn=Directory\ Manager \
          --rootUserPassword password \
          --hostname gaetan-laptop \
          --adminConnectorPort 4444 \
          --sampleData 10 \
          --baseDn dc=example,dc=com


2. Run dsconfig interactively to update the default key manager provider to replace the file path with an empty string

$ bin/dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D cn=directory\ manager -w password -X
[...]
Do you want to modify the "key-store-file" property?

    1)  Keep the value: config/keystore
    2)  Change the value

    q)  quit
    ?)  help

Enter choice [1]: 2


Enter a value for the "key-store-file" property: 

Press RETURN to continue 


>>>> Configure the properties of the Key Manager Provider "Default Key Manager"

        Property        Value(s)
        -------------------------------------------
    1)  enabled         true
    2)  key-store-file  ""
    3)  key-store-pin   &{file:config/keystore.pin}
    4)  key-store-type  PKCS12

    a)  show advanced components and properties
    q)  quit
    c)  cancel
    f)  finish - apply changes
    ?)  help

Enter choice [f]: 
The File Based Key Manager Provider could not be modified due to a
communications problem: Invalid Attribute Syntax: When attempting to modify
entry cn=Default Key Manager,cn=Key Manager Providers,cn=config to replace the
set of values for attribute ds-cfg-key-store-file, value "" was found to be
invalid according to the associated syntax: The provided value "" is not
allowed for attributes with syntax 'DirectoryString'. It neither match the
syntax nor an expression.
$ echo $?
80



The error message should be less verbose and the tool should proceed as it normally does by asking the user if he want to solve the problem by editing the component again.
Note that I didn't try to set empty string to other attribute but this might reproducible for all property associated to attribute type with a directory string syntax.
