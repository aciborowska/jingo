In some tests we set the "trust-manager-provider" property for a "LDAPS Connection Handler" and we expect to have this change to take effect immediately as mentioned in the "Configuration Reference" document.


trust-manager-provider

Synopsis	Specifies the name of the trust manager that should be used with the LDAP Connection Handler .
...
Admin Action Required	None
Changes to this property take effect immediately, but only for subsequent attempts to access the trust manager provider for associated client connections.
...



But in these tests we have to restart the LDAPS Connection Handler to have this change correctly applied (in 3.5 this change is correctly applied without restart of the connection handler).
