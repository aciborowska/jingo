Setup fails when run either using the GUI or CLI.

Here's how I reproduced it:



/path/to$ unzip /Users/mark/Documents/opendj/opendj-server-legacy/build/package/OpenDJ-3.0.0.zip
/path/to$ cd opendj/
/path/to/opendj$ setup --cli

What would you like to use as the initial root user DN for the Directory
Server? [cn=Directory Manager]: 
Please provide the password to use for the initial root user: 
Please re-enter the password for confirmation: 

Provide the fully-qualified directory server host name that will be used when
generating self-signed certificates for LDAP SSL/StartTLS, the administration
connector, and replication [Marks-MacBook-Pro.local]: opendj.example.com

On which port would you like the Directory Server to accept connections from
LDAP clients? [1389]: 

On which port would you like the Administration Connector to accept
connections? [4444]: 

Do you want to create base DNs in the server? (yes / no) [yes]: 

Provide the base DN for the directory data: dc=example,dc=com
Options for populating the database:

    1)  Only create the base entry
    2)  Leave the database empty
    3)  Import data from an LDIF file
    4)  Load automatically-generated sample data

Enter choice [1]: 

Do you want to enable SSL? (yes / no) [no]: 

Do you want to enable Start TLS? (yes / no) [no]: 

Do you want to start the server when the configuration is completed? (yes /
no) [yes]:
