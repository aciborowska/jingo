Happens with OpenDJ ldapsearch command line, openldap ldapsearch and JNDI client.

The first set of entries is returned (100 here in this example), and the error happens afterward.

Next run with 2000 entries only.
Works with openldap ldapsearch (paging ok) but openDJ ldapsearch returns all 2000 entries without paging...
