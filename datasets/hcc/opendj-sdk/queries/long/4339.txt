Problem found with OpenDJ 5.5.0 rev ebdfbc869ed

We noticed a perf regression using the following addrate command (addrate template in attachment):

$ addrate -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w password -d 3600 -S -C random -c 40 -i 30 -s 10000 ./addrate.template



With the these two revision the throughput is the same (500 add 500 del)

	with rev 6f843d2e809 => average etime was 37ms
	with rev ebdfbc869ed => average etime is 65ms



NOTE: same kind of problem with searchrate and rebind
