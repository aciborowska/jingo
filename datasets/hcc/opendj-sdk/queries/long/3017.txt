Scenario
1. Run a ldapsearch with a matching rule which cannot be used with the given attribute.


ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1390 -D "cn=myself" -w password -T -b "ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" "(cn:integerMatch:=1)" uid



The integerMatch rule is valid, but not applicable to cn values.

Actual behavior
With OpenDJ-3.0.0 (and OpenDJ-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT) the server returns rc==80 and logs an exception "java.lang.NullPointerException" to log files.

Expected behavior
I would expect same behavior as using OpenDJ-4.0.0 rev 06ac0197984  and it is rc==0 and message and without logging ERROR message to logs.
