Hi

Maybe I am missing something important here. But there is nothing in the OpenDJ docs about this... 

I tried to rename an entry with ldapmodify like:

dn: cn=test,o=TESTDOM
changetype: moddn
newrdn: cn=test2
deleteoldrdn: 1

I get insufficient privileges all the time. I have read something about import and export needed. And as it is not included in "all" in an ACI I added it. And The ACI allows "*" for the attributes. The user can add, modify and delete anything in this branch. But a rename wont work. 

aci: (target = "ldap:///o=TESTDOM")  (targetscope = "subtree") (targetattr = "*")   (version 3.0; acl "Full  write access to TESTDOM subtree"; allow (all,import,export)  (groupdn = "ldap:///cn=testgroup,ou=accessrights,o=TESTDOM") 

The only way I can make this work as a work around is to use "bypass-acl" for this. But this is not accepted....

The Sun Directory had a "server-prop" moddn-enable:on. But no such option exists here.

I can also see some cases here regarding modrdn...
Bug? Or just me missing something important?
