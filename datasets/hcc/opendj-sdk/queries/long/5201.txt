With the double prompt to trust the local server certificate in interactive dsconfig coupled with a default of don't trust, a user reading prompts has the impression that something is broken in the tool. Consider this interaction:

The certificate 'CN=localhost, O=OpenDJ RSA Self-Signed Certificate' is not trusted for the following reason: unable to find valid certification path to requested target

Server Certificate:

User DN  : CN=localhost, O=OpenDJ RSA Self-Signed Certificate
Validity : From 'Wed Jun 20 09:48:39 CEST 2018'
             To 'Tue Jun 15 09:48:39 CEST 2038'
Issuer   : CN=localhost, O=OpenDJ RSA Self-Signed Certificate



Do you trust this server certificate?

  1) No
  2) Yes, for this session only
  3) Yes, also add it to a truststore
  4) View certificate details

Enter choice: [1]: 2

If you read carefully, you might notice that the reasons given for not trusting the same certificate are different. You might notice the curiously long validity period of this self-signed cert. But you definitely notice that the default choice the second time for the cert you just agreed to trust is 1) No.
