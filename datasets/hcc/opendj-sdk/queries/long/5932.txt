When performing a full upgrade (no --data-only option) from 5.5.0 to 7.0.0, the tool shows these messages:

 * OpenDJ configuration will be upgraded from version 5.5.0 to 7.0.0
 * OpenDJ data will be upgraded from version 6.0.0 to 7.0.0

>>>> OpenDJ configuration was successfully upgraded from version 5.5.0 to 7.0.0
>>>> OpenDJ data was successfully upgraded from version 6.0.0 to 7.0.0


This is confusing because the end user might think "wait, the application data was only upgraded from 6.0.0 to 7.0.0, what if there were data model changes in between 5.5.0 and 6.0.0? is that a bug?"

Instead the tool could only mention the final version:

 * OpenDJ configuration will be upgraded to version 7.0.0
 * OpenDJ data will be upgraded to version 7.0.0
[...]
>>>> OpenDJ configuration was successfully upgraded to version 7.0.0
>>>> OpenDJ data was successfully upgraded to version 7.0.0


Note: In the output examples above, the revision numbers were omitted for clarity but upgrade tool will print them in reality.
