Environment

Tested on raclette machine.

PyForge has been used to set up the environment using attached PyForge config and following command

./run-pybot.py -n -v -c stress -s operations.basic* -t addrate* OpenDJ

Testing

When env was prepared I have run addrate load from 0 to 10M identity entries using command

./addrate --hostname raclette.internal.forgerock.com --port 1389 \
          --bindDn "uid=admin" --bindPassword password \
          --maxDuration 18000 --scriptFriendly \
          --deleteMode fifo \
          --numConnections 20 --numConcurrentRequests 3 \
          --statInterval 1 --noRebind \
          --deleteSizeThreshold 10000000 \
          /path/to/pyforge/PyBot/OpenDJ/testcases/data/stress_addrate.template

Note: the template is slightly edited from what is in PyForge so it is attached.
Results and observations

Average throughput of 6.5.0 was 844.4 adds/sec and with 7.0.0 average was 773.5 adds/sec (8.4% worse). See trends of TPS during the load.

CPU utilization was around 12%, Heap size was at 11GB at max and iostat utility was saying iowait=0.2%.
Other observations

Around 4M entries in DS happened (applies both to 6.5.0 and 7.0.0):

	heap has been enlarged from about 4G to about 10GB
	used heap started to oscillate much more (difference of used heap before and after GC has raised from about 1GB to about 4,5GB - see attachment) 
	throughput has raised
