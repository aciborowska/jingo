The result code is 80 (OTHER) with the following message:


Other: An internal error occurred while attempting to determine whether the operation would have resulted in a unique attribute conflict (result Size Limit Exceeded, message Size Limit Exceeded: This search operation has sent the maximum of 2 entries to the client)

instead of result code 19 (CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION) the more correct error message:


A unique attribute conflict was detected for attribute mail:
value user1t@test already exists in entry uid=1user.1,ou=People,o=test

This can happen when the unique attribute plugin configuration changes after data exist and these data already contain duplicate information.
Example of plugin configuration changes: plugin gets enabled, new unique attribute types, are added, new base DNs  are added, ...
