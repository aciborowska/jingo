We currently have two subtree specification syntaxes differing only in the specificationFilter field (item:xxx in the first case, and a search filter in the second case):


	RFC3672: this is introduced by the first field being "base".




	Relative: this is introduced by the first field being "relativeBase".



This subtle difference is a bit misleading since both RDN sequences are relative. We should combine the two into a single syntax. For backwards compatibility we should continue to support the "relativeBase" field. The specification filter should be parsed as follows:


	if it begins with "item:", "and:", "or:", or "not:" then parse as RFC3672




	otherwise, parse as a normal search filter.
