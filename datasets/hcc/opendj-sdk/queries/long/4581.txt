When trying to build opendj-docs today, I found the configref was broken.

IntelliJ won't validate XML files that large, but once I got everything set up to validate, I found this problem in the source:

$ xmllint --noout --schema /tmp/docbook.xsd doc-builds/target/docbkx-sources/configref/index.xml
/tmp/docbook.xsd:4: element import: Schemas parser warning : Element '{http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema}import': Skipping import of schema located at '/tmp/xml.xsd' for the namespace 'http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace', since this namespace was already imported with the schema located at 'http://www.w3.org/2001/xml.xsd'.
doc-builds/target/docbkx-sources/configref/index.xml:468: element variablelist: Schemas validity error : Element '{http://docbook.org/ns/docbook}variablelist': Missing child element(s). Expected is one of ( {http://docbook.org/ns/docbook}title, {http://docbook.org/ns/docbook}titleabbrev, {http://docbook.org/ns/docbook}info, {http://docbook.org/ns/docbook}itemizedlist, {http://docbook.org/ns/docbook}orderedlist, {http://docbook.org/ns/docbook}procedure, {http://docbook.org/ns/docbook}simplelist, {http://docbook.org/ns/docbook}variablelist, {http://docbook.org/ns/docbook}segmentedlist, {http://docbook.org/ns/docbook}glosslist ).
doc-builds/target/docbkx-sources/configref/index.xml fails to validate



Indeed the Monitoring category currently doesn't seem to contain anything:


            <section xml:id="subcommands-categories-monitoring">
                <title>Monitoring</title>

                <variablelist>
                </variablelist>
            </section>



DocBook does not allow an empty <variablelist>, so this content is well-formed but invalid.
