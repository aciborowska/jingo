Just after setting up a DJ3 instance with a persistit backend, we try to edit its configuration to disable numsubordinates but the change is unexpectedly rejected:

>>>> Configuring the "subordinate-indexes-enabled" property

    Indicates whether id2children and id2subtree indexes should be used for
    this backend. These indexes are used for constraining filtered searches to
    the search request's scope as well as for generating values for the
    hasSubordinates and numSubordinates virtual attributes.

    Subordinate indexing is enabled by default and should only be disabled for
    specialized use cases. A typical use case is where the backend is to be
    subjected to heavy add/delete load beneath the same parent entry such as
    when used as a session database. Disabling the subordinate indexes means
    that the numSubordinates and hasSubordinates virtual attributes will not
    be supported.

Do you want to modify the "subordinate-indexes-enabled" property?

    1)  Keep the default value: true
    2)  Change it to the value: false

Enter choice [f]:

The Persistit Backend could not be modified because of the following reason:


	Unwilling to Perform: Entry
       ds-cfg-backend-id=userRoot,cn=Backends,cn=config cannot be modified
       because one of the configuration change listeners registered for that
       entry rejected the change: Configuration attribute
       ds-cfg-db-cache-percent has a value of 50% but the JVM has only 35%
       available



Would you like to edit the properties of the Persistit Backend again in order
to resolve this problem? (yes / no) [yes]:
