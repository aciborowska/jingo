Grizzly is pre-allocating a default MemoryManager. Problem is that this MemoryManager is configured in such a way that it pre-allocates 10% of the heap-size.
This is a total waste given that we're not even using this MemoryManager: we're configuring another one which is pre-allocating roughly  64Mb of direct memory (off-heap).

The issue can be considered as fixed if we can prevent Grizzly from pre-allocating this amount or be able to reduce the amount.
