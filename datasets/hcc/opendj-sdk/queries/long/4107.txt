Recently, the dsreplication command started failing with the current error.


./bin/dsreplication purge-historical -h dj-robot-linux.internal.forgerock.com -p 4444 -b dc=com -I admin -w password -X -n

An error occurred while parsing the command-line arguments: The argument configFile is required to have a value but none was provided in the argument list and no default value is available See "dsreplication --help" to get more usage help

I'm guessing this is a bug, since the param isn't even mentioned in the docs. Definatelly shouldn't be required.

Happened first on a Daily test with rev.Â 60eeeb1e9f95ce9ba042404b59daaca597706a4c
