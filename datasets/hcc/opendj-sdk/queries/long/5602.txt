Found using OpenDJ 6.5.0-SNAPSHOT (rev ae2bb50644f).

Scenario
1. install a server
2. configure the server with SASL External (as done by the test)
3. do ldapsearch with client certificate not present in the server TrustStore

$ /tmp/DJ1/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h dj-linux.internal.forgerock.com -p 1636   -o mech=EXTERNAL -b "dc=com" -X -Z -E -K /tmp/DJ1/opendj/client_cert/clientkeystore -W "clientkeystorepass" -N "client-100-cert" "uid=user.340" postalCode	
-- rc --
returned 81, expected [91]
-- stdout --

-- stderr --
Warning: the entry associated with alias 'client-100-cert' in keystore
'/tmp/DJ1/opendj/client_cert/clientkeystore'
does not match key types and issuers requested by the server. If required by
the server, SSL client authentication will fail

The LDAP bind request failed: 81 (Server Connection Closed)



==> with previous JDK we got a return code of 91 and now 81 (Server Connection Closed)

How to reproduce this single issue:

$ ./run-pybot.py -s clu_secure_group..ClusSASLExternalDJ -t Subject_Equals_Dn_With_Trustfile DJ



To verify the other failures with SASL External:

$ ./run-pybot.py -s clu_secure_group.ClusSASLExternal* DJ
