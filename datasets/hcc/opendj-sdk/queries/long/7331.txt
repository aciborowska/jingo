The attached script installs two DS 6.5.3 servers with the eval profile, configures and initializes replication, then upgrades the replicas to 7, and runs the cleanup command.

That command fails to update the configuration somehow:

Removing servers from admin backend ..... Done
Removing instance keys from admin backend ..... Done
Removing administrators from admin backend ..... Done
Cleaning and updating configuration of server localhost:5444 ..... Cannot update configuration for server 'localhost:5444'. The error was: The
requested managed object could not be found
Check the server error logs for additional details 

There doesn't seem to be any additional information in logs/errors.
