Section 9.1, Procedure 9.1

The syntax for offline backup is incorrect. The syntax as shown will give the following error:-

You have provided options for scheduling this operation as a task but options
provided for connecting to the server's tasks backend resulted in the
following error: 'Connect Error'


I think the syntax only needs to be:-

backup --backupAll ---backupDirectory /path/to/OpenDJ/bak
