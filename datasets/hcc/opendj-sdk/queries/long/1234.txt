Difference between the Control Panel and CLI.  The Control Panel will accept administrator password with special characters, the CLI will not.  Issue was discovered with dsreplication.  The admin password was not accepted, attempted with ldapsearch, ldapmodify, etc as well.  I log into the Control Panel with this password with no problem.
