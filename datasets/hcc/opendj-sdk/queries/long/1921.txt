   Functional tests are failing due to missing changes in the changelog changeNumber. I have found this happens from revision: 11940

   Looks that we are missing every time same changes.

   On topology with two instances, three entries are added with ldapmodify tool.

   First entry on first instance, second entry on second instance and third entry on first instance.

    After that they are search by ldapsearch (to be sure all entries were replicated) and than are checked changes in changelog.

    During the check of changes we are missing every time the change on first entry.
