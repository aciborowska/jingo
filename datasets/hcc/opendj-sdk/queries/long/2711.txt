When I run dsconfig -D "cn=directory manager" -p .. -h ...  -X -w ... set-global-configuration-prop --set invalid-attribute-syntax-behavior:warn, I manage to import data with empty attribute values (for example: "mail: ").
The problem is that it generates messages with the ERROR severity level, instead of WARNING security level, as it could be expected according to the DJ 3 reference guide:


warn
The directory server accepts attribute values that are invalid according to their associated syntax, but also logs a warning message to the error log. Matching operations targeting those values may not behave as expected.

Example of message:

"[22/f√©vr./2016:08:00:45 -0600] category=UTIL severity=ERROR msgID=org.opends.messages....".



If the behaviour is expected, then this is a document bug and this ticket should be modified and reassigned accordingly ..
