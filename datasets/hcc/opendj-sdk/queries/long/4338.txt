Procedure 8.8 in the admin guide documents how to set up a standalone replication server. The explanation uses host names opendj.example.com and opendj2.example.com. However the examples provided use host nameÂ replica.example.com for the 2nd server. The server names should be consistent to make the documentation easier to follow.
