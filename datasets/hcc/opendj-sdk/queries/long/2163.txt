In spite the ds-cfg-listen-address is defined in the JMX connection handler definition, OpenDJ keeps listening on all available interfaces, even after a server restart.
As required, the IP address is defined when creating the JMX connection handler (the default one is removed before).

The same applies for the ds-cfg-source-address parameter of the replication server configuration (but here, the IP address can be modified after creation).

Both above limitations are a problem if one wants to deploy multiple OpenDJ instances on the same host and same ports, each instance bound to a different IP address (which may be the case for customers mutualizing non-production environments)

Configuration examples follow:

dn: cn=JMX Connection Handler,cn=connection handlers,cn=config
objectClass: ds-cfg-jmx-connection-handler
objectClass: top
objectClass: ds-cfg-connection-handler
ds-cfg-enabled: true
ds-cfg-java-class: org.opends.server.protocols.jmx.JmxConnectionHandler
ds-cfg-listen-address: my_local_ip_address1
ds-cfg-listen-port: 1689
cn: JMX Connection Handler


dn: cn=replication server,cn=Multimaster Synchronization,cn=Synchronization Providers,cn=config
objectClass: top
objectClass: ds-cfg-replication-server
ds-cfg-replication-server-id: 1
ds-cfg-replication-port: 8989
cn: replication server
ds-cfg-source-address: my_local_ip_address2
ds-cfg-replication-db-directory: changelogDb



The problem described here's been noticed in an OpenAM 12 embedded directory, but is probably also true for a standalone OpenDJ 2.6.2.
