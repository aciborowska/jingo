The JMX connection handler listens on 2 ports, only one of which is configurable - 1689, the default listen-port. A random port is also listened on, and remote tools such as jconsole need to connect to both ports.

The use of a random port makes it difficult to create firewall rules which allow JMX traffic through.

The problem seems to come from the RMI Connector, when it instantiate the RMIJRMPServer:


RmiConnector.java:388 (v 2.6.2)


OpendsRMIJRMPServerImpl opendsRmiConnectorServer =
          new OpendsRMIJRMPServerImpl(
              0, rmiClientSockeyFactory, rmiServerSockeyFactory, env);



The value 0 is the port number.

The constructor prototype:


  public OpendsRMIJRMPServerImpl(int port, RMIClientSocketFactory csf,
      RMIServerSocketFactory ssf, Map<String, ?> env) throws IOException
  {



As 0 is a special value, the port will be chosen randomly.



* A port number of <code>zero</code> will let the system pick up anâ€¨    * ephemeral port in a <code>bind</code> operation.
from InetSocketAddress constructor




You can see this opened port by running OpenAM with an embedded OpenDJ and do a 


netstat -apn | grep $OPENAM_PID | grep LISTEN 


In my case, the first time, I had:



tcp6      0      0 :::1689                :::*                    LISTEN      4771/java       
tcp6      0      0 :::18009                :::*                    LISTEN      4771/java       
tcp6      0      0 :::4444                :::*                    LISTEN      4771/java       
tcp6      0      0 :::18080                :::*                    LISTEN      4771/java       
tcp6      0      0 :::33121                :::*                    LISTEN      4771/java       
tcp6      0      0 :::50889                :::*                    LISTEN      4771/java       
tcp6      0      0 127.0.0.1:18005        :::*                    LISTEN      4771/java       
tcp6      0      0 :::50389                :::*                    LISTEN      4771/java 



33121 is the port opened in the RMI connector

and after restarting openAM:



tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      5384/java       
tcp6       0      0 :::1689                 :::*                    LISTEN      5384/java       
tcp6       0      0 :::18009                :::*                    LISTEN      5384/java       
tcp6       0      0 :::4444                 :::*                    LISTEN      5384/java       
tcp6       0      0 :::18080                :::*                    LISTEN      5384/java       
tcp6       0      0 :::50889                :::*                    LISTEN      5384/java       
tcp6       0      0 :::33039                :::*                    LISTEN      5384/java       
tcp6       0      0 :::50389                :::*                    LISTEN      5384/java



The second time, the port is 33039
