Raised by Ludovic Poitou on CR-6983 .
In opendj-config/.../protocol.properties, there is a lot of messages which are not protocol related. It might be nice to move them in a more appropriate file.
We also need to ensure that we have no protocol/config message duplicated between the different maven modules.
