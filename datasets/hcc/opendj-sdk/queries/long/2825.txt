Using the 4.0.0 OEM archive.

Try to setup an server:

$ ./opendj/bin/start-ds -F
ERROR:  The detected Java version could not be used.  The detected
Java binary is:
/usr/java/jdk1.7/bin/java
You must specify the path to a valid Java 7.0 or higher version.
The procedure to follow is:
1. Delete the file /tmp/opendj/lib/set-java-home if it exists.
2. Set the environment variable OPENDJ_JAVA_HOME to the root of a valid
Java 7.0 installation.
If you want to have specific Java settings for each command line you must
follow the steps 3 and 4.
3. Edit the properties file specifying the Java binary and the Java arguments
for each command line.  The Java properties file is located in:
/tmp/opendj/config/java.properties.
4. Run the command-line /tmp/opendj/bin/dsjavaproperties



=> same command works fine with standard archive

Looking at the bootstrap.jar and bootstrap-client.jar I noticed that the jar names in the MANIFEST file are not correct.

 more META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Class-Path: OpenDJ.jar OpenDJ_ca_ES.jar OpenDJ_es.jar OpenDJ_de.jar...



=> the jar names are now in lower case
