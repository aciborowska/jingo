Upgrade only tries to migrate entries in config.ldif that have been modified from the initial version. New config entries created via dsconfig are just copied across verbatim, even if they need to be updated to work in the new version.

For example, a password policy object created in 2.4.x will not contain ds-cfg-java-class, which is effectively a mandatory attribute in 2.5.0.
