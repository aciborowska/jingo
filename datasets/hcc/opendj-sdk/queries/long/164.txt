We've had regular reports of 2.4.x users hitting JE issue #19567 described in the 4.1.10 release notes (top item):

The user reports include stack traces which confirm that the described deadlock has occurred. We've not seen this occur in our own testing, so it would seem that the risk of deadlock may depend somewhat on external factors such as hardware, OS, etc (this is not surprising since deadlocks are often sensitive to timing).

We've already updated the trunk to JE 4.1.10, but we should also upgrade the 2.4.x branch for subsequent 2.4.x patch releases.
