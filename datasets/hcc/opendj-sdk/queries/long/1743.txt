While developing unit tests for the new backend, I was calling entry related APIs (addEntry(), deleteEntry(), etc.) with a null operation, as described.
It does not work for renameEntry(), though, since it calls removeSubordinateEntry() who does not test for a null ModifyDNOperation, hence generating a NPE.
