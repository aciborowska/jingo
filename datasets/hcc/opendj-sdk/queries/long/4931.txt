In stress tests I noticed a degradation of performance of searchrate tool. The decrease hit a limit of 5% we have in tests and the degradation is 5.3%.

Scenario

Two sets of servers:

	5.5.0 (2 servers in DSRS mode)
	6.0.0-SNAPSHOT (2 servers in DSRS mode)



With each set of servers we run following steps:

	setup servers and enable replication between them
	add 5000 entries and 1000 groups
	run searchrate without returning any attributes (1.1):
	
./searchrate -h pyforge.example.com -p 1390 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -d 1860 -b ou=People,dc=example,dc=com -S -F -B 60 -c 10 -i 18 -t 4 -g "rand(0,4999)" "(uid=user.{1})" 1.1




At the end we check we didn't hit any error and check the average throughput of both sets:

	At this point we hit the problem, because the average throughput difference is higher then 5%.
	
Average throughput 48960.900000 for version 6.0.0-SNAPSHOT is lower than average throughput 51646.900000 of version 5.5.0 with more than 5 %
