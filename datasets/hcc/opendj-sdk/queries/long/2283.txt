When using a Non-Self-Signed Cert for the Admin Connector, setting the ds-cfg-trust-store-pin as opposed to the ds-cfg-trust-store-pin-file, the server tries to create a new self-signed certificate and fails to start. The following error can be seen in the start up message.

OpenDJ: The administration connector self-signed certificate cannot be generated because the following error occurred: null.

Setting the ds-cfg-trust-store-pin-file resolves the problem.

The createSelfSignedCertificateIfNeeded method in org.opends.server.admin.AdministrationConnector.java attempts to create a certificate if the pin file is not configured.
