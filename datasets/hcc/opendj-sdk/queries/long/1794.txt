Found using OpenDJ 3.0.0 revision 11699.

The upgrade procedure is the following:

	stop the instance
	unpack the new files from the .zip delivery over the current server files
	run upgrade tool
	start the server



And if a user tries to use the scripts (available in bin|bat folder) between step 2 and 3, the tools should exist with the following error message (on stderr):

The OpenDJ binary version '3.0.0.11699' does not match the installed version '2.6.0.9086'. Please run upgrade before continuing ' should be empty.


But the following tools display this message on stdout instead of stderr:

	dsreplication
	manage-tasks
	status



And the following tool don't display this error message:

	dsconfig

$ dsconfig -h localhost -p 4459 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X get-connection-handler-prop --handler-name "LDAP Connection Handler" -n
Unable to connect to the server at "localhost" on port 4459
