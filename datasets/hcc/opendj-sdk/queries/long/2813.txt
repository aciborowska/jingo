Found with OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev f3c2fff8d4282592a95e169a73cbccb423cbe451

We install and setup a server, importing some data in it.
We perform a ldapsearch using option --filename to pass some filters:


${INSTANCE1}/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w password -T -b "ou=ldapsearch,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com"  --filename /local/GIT/pyforge/PyBot/OpenDJ/testcases/functional/clu_group/data/filters.ldif "(objectClass=*)" dn
SEARCH operation failed
Result Code:  80 (Other)
Additional Information:  org.forgerock.i18n.LocalizedIllegalArgumentException: The attribute description "(objectClass=*)" could not be parsed because it contains an invalid character "(" at position 0
