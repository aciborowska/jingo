Found with rev cd031467a88

We have a suite of tests that check tools behavior when newer binaries are copied over a dj instance but upgrade has not been run yet to check the consistency of error messages.
When copying 6.5.0 binaries over 6.0.0, if we run dsconfig offline, we get the following error message:


./DJ_BEFORE1/opendj/bin/dsconfig --offline get-connection-handler-prop --handler-name "LDAP" -n
The OpenDJ binary version '6.5.0' does not match the installed version
'6.0.0.cf670d07003a6410cf757ab079d233692b74936e'. Please run upgrade before
continuing




Now if we do that between 7.0.0 and 6.0.0, we have:


./DJ_BEFORE1/opendj/bin/dsconfig --offline get-connection-handler-prop --handler-name "LDAP" -n
Other: Binary version '7.0.0' does not match configuration file version
'Unknown'. Please use the same tool version as the configuration file



Shouldn't we keep the messages consistent?

To reproduce:

./run-pybot.py -n -s upgrade_group.CluBeforeUpgrade* -t dsconfig opendj
