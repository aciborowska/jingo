The password failure count, locking and unlocking features of Password Policy are exercising some unusual sequence of Modifications that is not replayed on a replica, like it is on the original server.

Reproducing the pb requires a mix of operations combined with appropriate timing. See the attached script that replays the scenario in a few minutes.

In a nutshell, when a single modify operation contains multiple operations on the same attribute, especially a Delete of one or more values, followed by a delete by Replace with no values, the later modification is skipped when replayed on the Replica.

In the case of the lockout policy, this can result in a account being locked on a replica server, while it would be usable on others.
