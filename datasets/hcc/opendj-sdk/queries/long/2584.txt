Found using OpenDJ 3.0.0 rev 69136490e98ede56d5bf31eb1100b9db1eea32a2 (RC2)

Scenario
1. install server
2. create Common Audit log publisher and enable it
3. create a keystore and a keystore pin file
4. enable tamper-evident (provide keystore and keystore pin previously generated)
5. restart the CA log publisher (disable and enable it)

When enabling it we get the following error:

The Csv File Access Log Publisher could not be modified due to a
communications problem: Other: The attempt to apply the configuration
modification failed. The preliminary checks were all successful and the
modified entry was written to the server configuration, but at least one of
the configuration change listeners reported an error when attempting to apply
the change: Error while creating or updating common audit log publisher
