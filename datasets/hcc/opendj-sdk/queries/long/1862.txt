I trying to update two attributes using REST and PATCH. There is currently no documentation on syntax on how this can be done for more then one attribute.  I found a syntax that was excepted by OpenDJ, but both fields were set the value of the last 'value' argument. Then tried two REST PATCH call in a sequence for each field, and the result was the same. The first PATCH field was also updated with the value of the second/last PATCH call. 

Updating both fields:
curl - updating both fields

curl --user tward:Passw0rd 
  --request PATCH 
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
  --data '[
     {"operation": "replace","field": "preferredLanguage","value": "A-Value"}, 
     {"operation": "replace","field": "description","value": "B-Value"}
   ]' 'http://localhost:5080/users/tward?_prettyPrint=true'



Updating the fields one by one, first 'preferredLanguage'
curl - updating only 'preferredLanguage'

curl --user tward:Passw0rd 
  --request PATCH 
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
  --data '[
     {"operation": "replace","field": "preferredLanguage","value": "ApreferredLanguage"}
    ]' 'http://localhost:5080/users/tward?_prettyPrint=true'



curl - then updating only 'description'

curl --user tward:Passw0rd 
  --request PATCH 
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
  --data '[
     {"operation":"replace","field": "description","value": "Bdescription"}
   ]' 'http://localhost:5080/users/tward?_prettyPrint=true'



Added description to the http-config.json


"description" : { "simple": { "ldapAttribute" : "description", "isSingleValued" : true} },
