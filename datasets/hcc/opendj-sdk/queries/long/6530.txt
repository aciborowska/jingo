>>>> Preparing to upgrade

  OpenDJ 3.0.0 introduced changes to the JE backend configuration and database
  format. The upgrade will update all JE backend configurations, but will only
  migrate JE backend databases which are associated with *enabled* JE
  backends. It is very strongly recommended that any existing data has been
  backed up and that you have read the upgrade documentation before
  proceeding. Do you want to proceed with the upgrade? (yes/no) [no]: yes

  OpenDJ 3.0.0 changed the matching rule implementations. All indexes have to
  be rebuilt. This could take a long time to proceed. Do you want to launch
  this process automatically at the end of the upgrade? (yes/no) [no]: yes

  OpenDJ 3.5.0 introduced a new format for all equality indexes based on
  "distinguishedName" attribute type, like "member", "owner", "roleOccupant"
  and "seeAlso". They all have to be rebuilt if they exist on your server and
  this could take a long time to proceed. Do you want to launch this process
  automatically at the end of the upgrade? (yes/no) [no]: yes

  OpenDJ 3.5.0 introduced a new configuration model for the HTTP connection
  handler and its associated endpoints. Any enabled HTTP connection handlers
  will be disabled during the upgrade due to the break in compatibility.
  Do you want to make this configuration change? (yes/no) [yes]: 

  OpenDJ 5.5.0 changed the indexing algorithm for JSON equality matching
  rules. All JSON based attribute indexes must be rebuilt which may take a
  long time. Do you want to rebuild the indexes automatically at the end of
  the upgrade? (yes/no) [no]: yes
