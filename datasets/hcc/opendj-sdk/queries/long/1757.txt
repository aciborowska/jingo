After double-clicking the .msi and successfully completing the setup wizard, OpenDJ files are laid out under C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenDJ. (The system is 64-bit, and the version of Java 7 installed is 64-bit as well.)

Unfortunately neither double-clicking setup.bat nor running it from cmd.exe as Administrator seem to have an effect.

Running setup --help from the command line does display usage.
