When setting up an instance of OpenDJ versions 3.x->4.x with a separate instance path, the `licenseAccepted` file is created under `instance_path/legal-notices/licenseAccepted`. This is also the location where the `upgrade` tool expects the file when upgrading to these versions.

For versions 5.5.x and 6.x however, the behavior has changed, and the file is created under `install_path/legal-notices/licenseAccepted`, and is expected at the same place when upgrading to these versions.

This causes the upgrade tool (when upgrading from 3.x or 4.x to 5.5+) to prompt for accepting the license again, even when it was accepted during the setup, which is not the case for servers where instance_path == install_path.
