Since OPENDJ-4887, metrics dumped from JE environment stats are computed using the common monitoring api.
At the moment, metrics values are always the same regardless activity performed on the db.
This is due to the fact that the EnvironmentStats object from which metrics are collected is always the same.
This object should be refreshed for each gauge value supplier call or at least periodically as it is done in JEBackend#JeBackendMonitor.
