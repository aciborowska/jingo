Found with OpenDJ 3.0.0 rev 4d9a927848fc09827974e85c7736d56aad46c792
OEM version

We set up a dj server with the OEM version and run the control-panel.
We expect to have only references to PDB and nothing relating to JE.
But if we go to Monitoring > General Information, there is a node that refers to some JE databases information. 

Whilst this node is empty, we would expect not to see it displayed at all in the tree.
