Doc tests began failing this weekend with https://ci.forgerock.org/job/OpenDJ-build/job/master/2664/ .

https://ci.forgerock.org/job/opendj-docs-test-pipeline/job/master/272/ shows one failure, which is the "try indexed debugsearchindex" test, corresponding to the first example of debugsearchindex output in https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/ds/config-guide/indexing.html#debug-search :

{
  "filter": {
    "intersection": [
      {
        "index": "givenName.caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch:6",
        "range": "[aa,ab[",
        "candidates": 171,
        "retained": 171
      },
      {
        "index": "givenName.caseIgnoreMatch",
        "range": "[aa,ab[",
        "candidates": 50,
        "retained": 50
      },
      {
        "filter": "(objectclass=person)",
        "union": [
          {
            "index": "objectClass.objectIdentifierMatch",
            "exact": "person",
            "candidates": "[LIMIT-EXCEEDED]"
          }
        ],
        "candidates": "[LIMIT-EXCEEDED]",
        "retained": 50
      }
    ],
    "candidates": 50
  },
  "scope": {
    "type": "sub",
    "candidates": "[NOT-INDEXED]",
    "retained": 50
  },
  "final": 50
} 

To reproduce the failure locally in opendj-docs:

mvn clean -Ptest -Dskip.docker.build=false verify -Dexec.args="admin-guide/indexing.bats" 

There's probably a need to edit the test source to skip subsequent tests using the BATS skip keyword including cleanup that kills the container so that you can try the command again before the content of the container is changed in follow-on tests.
