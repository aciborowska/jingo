I think that a recent refactoring in the access logger or core operation logic now prevents replayed operations from being logged by default.

Steps to reproduce:

1) create 2-way replication
2) apply change to one replica
3) nothing gets logged on the second
4) check access log configuration: the default is suppress-synchronization-operations = false which means replayed operations should be logged (i.e not suppressed)
5) configure the access log to log internal operations (i.e. set suppress-internal-operations = false)
6) retry step 2
7) replicated operation is now logged

So it seems that replication (replayed) operations are being treated as internal operations.
