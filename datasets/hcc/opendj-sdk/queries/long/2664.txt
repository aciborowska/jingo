Scenario

	Install two instances
	Import LDIF to instance1 (template provided in attachment)
	Enable replication between these instances
	Initialize replication
	Set replication purge delay to 2400s on instance1
	Set replication purge delay to 2400s on instance2
	Check the servers are in sync
	Run modrate 

./opendj-ldap-toolkit/bin/modrate -h opendj.example.com -p 1389 -D "cn=dm" -w password -d 2400 -b uid=user.%d,ou=People,o=example -S -g "rand(0,99999)" -c 40 -t 3 -i 30 -F -g "randstr(40)" 'description:%2$s'

	dsreplication status -> missing changes than wait we to sync
	dsreplication status -> no divergences anymore
	Export data from instance1
	Export data from instance2
	Run ldif-diff between exported ldifs <=> LDIF files differs. (diff  provided in attachment)



Expected behavior
I expect all entries with same data across servers.

Actual behavior
After modrate on instance1 we have same number of entries on all servers but the data are different.

Note
I didn't find any error in log files (errors, replication).
