This issue is about import-ldif to existing backend.
If you try to do an import with option -B branch, this option is ignored.

The output of import-ldif contains number of entries which were proceeds.
The number is equal to number of entries in LDIF file.
So for instance I run tests with LDIF with 167 entries. Two entries are under branch ou=Departament,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com. This branch I used with import-ldif command and in the output I noticed number of proceeded entries equal to 167, 0 rejected and 0 skipped.

To reproduce the problem I attached a shell script.
