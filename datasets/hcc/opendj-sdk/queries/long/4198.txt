Found using OpenDJ SDK 4.1.0 (rev 0b7da454b79944f54e66daf3f591cefb5d77165b)

authrate tool always binds as the same user.

I ran the command available in the help:

$ ./authrate -p 1389 -D "uid=user.%d,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" -w password -f -c 10 -g "rand(0,2000)"



And looking at DJ access logs I noticed that the binds are always done with the same user (for instance "uid=user.6420,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com".
