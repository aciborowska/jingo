Found with OpenDJ 4.0.0 OEM rev 9fe774de65a84af8273a976bda67cf94e4aa21ad

We setup 2 DJs with 3.0.0, je backend, import some data and enable replication.
Then we stop, export the content of the first server, upgrade it and import the data again.
we start this server.

We try to export data on the second server and it fails with the following error:

An error occurred while trying to load the Directory Server schema:  An error
occurred at or near line 189 while trying to parse the configuration from LDIF
file /tmp/opendj-replication-inst2/opendj/config/config.ldif:
