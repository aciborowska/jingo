Found on opendj3-server-dev branch (r10576).

List log publishers using dsconfig command:

$ ./opendj/bin/dsconfig list-log-publishers -h localhost -p 6444 -D "cn=directory manager" -w "password" -n -X

The File Based Error Log Publisher could not be decoded due to the following
reason:

    *  The value "warning" is not a valid value for the "default-severity"
       property, which must have the following syntax: all | debug |
       fatal-error | info | mild-error | mild-warning | none | notice |
       severe-error | severe-warning



Same error when we get or set the properties for "File-Based Error Logger" publisher (it works fine for this other loggers):

$ ./opendj/bin/dsconfig get-log-publisher-prop --publisher-name "File-Based Error Logger" -h localhost -p 6444 -D "cn=directory manager" -w "password" -n -X --advanced
