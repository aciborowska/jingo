Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev d39f65ee5dfe8fcdf1faab98bf6fce2c1616a247

On Windows as administrator user I tried to setup an instance (from zip delivery) and I get the following error:

E:\>.\opendj\setup.bat -h localhost --adminConnectorPort 4444 -D cn=myself -w password
 
Validating parameters..... Done
An error occurred while modifying the configuration to harden it:
