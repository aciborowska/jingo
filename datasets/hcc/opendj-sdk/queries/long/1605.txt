The schema for ds-base-dn-entry-count is currently set to Integer; however in some circumstances the monitor backend sets this to non-Integer values, for example:


ds-base-dn-entry-count: 2002 dc=example,dc=com



This does not seem to cause any real operational problems, but if 'invalid-attribute-syntax-behavior' is set to 'warn' rather than 'reject' and there are multiple baseDN's under a backend, the server will log several alarming SEVERE_WARNINGs on startup:
