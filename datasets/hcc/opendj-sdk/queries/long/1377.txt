When an arbitrary _pagedResultsCookie value is used, the result is HTTP 500.


$ curl "http://bjensen:hifalutin@desktop.example.com:8080/users/?_queryFilter=true&_prettyPrint=true&_pageSize=3_pagedResultsOffset=2&_pagedResultsCookie=cookie-crumbs="
{
  "code" : 500,
  "reason" : "Internal Server Error",
  "message" : "The value cookie-crumbs= cannot be base64-decoded because it does not have a length that is a multiple of four bytes"
}



This being the web, I would expect the server either just to ignore the values it doesn't recognize, or else if we really want to be helpful, return HTTP 400 Bad Request with the same message.
