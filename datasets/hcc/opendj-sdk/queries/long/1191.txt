Very occasionally on some test environments I have seen the following error:


[15/Oct/2013:17:57:23 +0100] category=CORE severity=NOTICE msgID=458891 msg=The Directory Server has sent an alert notification generated by class org.opends.server.api.DirectoryThread (alert type org.opends.server.UncaughtException, alert ID 327820):  An uncaught exception during processing for thread Replication server RS(31158) connector thread has caused it to terminate abnormally.  The stack trace for that exception is:  java.lang.NullPointerException
  org.opends.server.util.StaticUtils.isLocalAddress(StaticUtils.java:4603)
  org.opends.server.replication.server.ReplicationServer.runConnect(ReplicationServer.java:430)
  org.opends.server.replication.server.ReplicationServerConnectThread.run(ReplicationServerConnectThread.java:64)



I have no idea how this can happen in reality but it is: it looks like the machine temporarily loses all of its network interfaces. So the call to java.net.NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces() returns null which we fail to handle.
