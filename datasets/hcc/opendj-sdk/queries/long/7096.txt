The documentation at https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/6.5/dev-guide/index.html#extensible-match-search mentions that in order to search for users who have authenticated in the last three months (13 weeks), the LDAP search filter should be “(lastLoginTime:1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.4.6:=13w)"

Actually the filter above would rather return all users that authenticated before “now+13 weeks ?”. The correct filter should be “(lastLoginTime:1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.4.5:=-13w)”, which BTW also aligns with https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/6.5/dev-guide/index.html#filter-operators
