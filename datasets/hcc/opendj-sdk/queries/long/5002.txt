Sometimes when we try to stop a replication server, we reach the timeout of 200s, with a parameter error saying the --port must be specified. This happens randomly in many of our tests, but always when stopping a replication server.


./bin/stop-ds
-- rc --
returned 89, expected 0
-- stdout --
Stopping Server...
The timeout of '200' seconds to start the server has been reached. You can
use the argument '--timeout' to increase this timeout

-- stderr --
An error occurred while parsing the command-line arguments: A port number
must be specified to connect to the server
