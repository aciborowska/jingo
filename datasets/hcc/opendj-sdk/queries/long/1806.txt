As noted in OPENDJ-1785, some of the descriptions for tools are formatted with line ends and spacing, which works to display usage in a terminal, but doesn't work when reusing the content in a context where whitespace is not significant.

As an example, try OPENDJ_JAVA_ARGS="-Dorg.forgerock.opendj.gendoc=true" authrate -?.
