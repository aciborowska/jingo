I've left this as Priority == Major only because this mention of Java 5 could be the first thing a users sees when installing OpenDJ by using the WebStart wizard. The text is "requires a Java SE 5.0 or higher runtime." It seems that ought to read, "requires a Java SE 6.0 or higher runtime."

If so, I'm guessing this can be fixed by editing src/messages/messages/quicksetup.properties:

INFO_INSTALLANDUPGRADE_WELCOME_PANEL_INSTRUCTIONS=The %s QuickSetup tool \
 can either install and configure a new server instance or upgrade an existing \
 server instance. <br><br> %s requires a Java SE 5.0 or higher runtime.<br><br> \
 Additional information on QuickSetup is available on the <a \
