Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev 0daa699dfd0

Scenario
1. setup a server with suffix "dc=com" with some sample data
2. perform a search on root DSE

$ ./opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w password -b ""  "objectclass=*"
$



=> we should have all the entries under "dc=com" returned
