Found with OpenDJ 3.5.0 final RC (566523750c522af582d185e7d328d7e4086244f8)

During manual testing of control panel:


	unzip the archive
	set up a server with o=example base-dn, 100 generated entries
	launch the control-panel tool
	
		export userRoot in cpt-example.ldif
		delete o=example base-dn (Manage Entries > in new dialog, Menu > Entries > Delete Base DN...)
		create a new base dn o=example, importing data from cpt-example.ldif => the pop-up windows hangs in the "creating default indexes...", nothing seems to happen, base dn is not created.
