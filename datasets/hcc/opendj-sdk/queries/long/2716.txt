As part of changes for OPENDJ-194 (in OpenDJ 2.6.0), the 'config/schema/03-changelog.ldif' file has been modified to add new attribute 'includedAttributes' and remove attribute 'targetUniqueID'.

But when we upgrade from earlier versions (2.4.x, 2.5.0) the '03-changelog.ldif' is not copied/patched and these changes are not applied to the new version.

So during upgrade we should:

	either copy this file from the template folder (like the '02-config.ldif')
	or add an upgrade task to patch it
