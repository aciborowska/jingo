In the tests of the dev guide chapter examples, I've started to add sleep 2 after (re)configuring the HTTP Connection Handler, because I sometimes see a return code 0, but then immediately see curl unable to connect for a REST call.

This never happens on my laptop, but does happen when the tests are running in a Docker container.
