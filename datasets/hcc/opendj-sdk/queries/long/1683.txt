Dear Team,

I am trying to install OpenDJ on my Dev environment but unfortunately it gives an error at last and nothing happen. 

I have attached the error screenshot. Along with that I have also attached the installation screenshots and the log file.
As per the log file, I thought that the Port no:389 is already in use and hence tried to install it again on a differet port :390 and 4004. But still it didn't install properly.

I have no idea why I am getting this error. It would be very helpful if you could look into this and help.

JAVA_HOME : C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin
OPENDJ_JAVA_HOME: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin
Path: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin; etc.......
