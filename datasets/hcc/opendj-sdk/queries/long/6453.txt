For OPENDJ-6055, I wrote the following unit test:

	perform a backup for all the backends
	perform an incremental backup for all the backends



As result, my assert about the content of the backup.info failed: for the backend indexRoot,Â  the line dependencies=... was missing for the section of the incremental backup.
 The test is BackupDbTestCase.testSeveralBackupAll() and this assert is BackupCommonTestCase.assertHasDescriptorFile().

The indexRoot backend is created in the test instance of the unit tests. It seems to interfere with the units tests for backup.
 So, we need to check whether we can remove this side-effect or not.
