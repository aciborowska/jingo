If schema replication is enabled and there is a custom schema file (99-user.ldif), it seems that the cn=schema attribute value is stored twice in the LDIF entry representation when the server is stopped:

dn: cn=schema
objectClass: top
objectClass: ldapSubentry
objectClass: subschema
cn: schema
cn: schema
...

This prevents the server from being restarted. Note that the problem only seems to manifest in the user schema ldif file and only when replication is enabled.
