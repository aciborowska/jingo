As a user, I want modrate/searchrate to execute for a limited duration  without having to worry about the generator function (inc, rand, etc.), the number of connections, threads or iterations.

The duration could be specified with simple time units like, for example:

	15s for 15 seconds
	10m for 10 minutes
	5h for 5 hours
	2.5d for 2 days and a half



Also, do we want to allow users to combine them together?
For example, specifying "2d 4h" would launch the perf test for 2 days and 4 hours.
