Our OpenDJ (as well as OpenDS, lastest stable version, we tested both) runs for about a week, then it crashes with an OutOfMemoryError.
We've provided the the OpenDJ instances which crashes start-ds command with the parameters "-server -Xms1g -Xmx1g" (up from 512m) which is still not enough. We found this [1] issue 
where a user provided even 4GB of memory and still runs out of memory. We've tried both replication with and without ssl which was mentioned in another issued once, neither helped.
The errors and replication log files are attached, we can provide further information if necessary.

Out topology:
We are running 4 OpenDJ instances (2 on ldap1-suse, 2 on ldap2-suse) whereby both machines should be equally fast.
OpenDJ1 on ldap1 (called master which has the runtime parameters -server -Xms1g -Xmx1g ) is receiving updates from an external programm.
The master replicates the data to the OpenDJ2 on ldap1 (called replication).
The replication replicates data to OpenDJ1 on ldap2 (called client1) as well as to OpenDJ1 on ldap2 (called client2).
