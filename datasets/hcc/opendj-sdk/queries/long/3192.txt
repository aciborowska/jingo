DN and AttributeDescription cache are referencing schema removing the goal of the weakhashmap to automatically evict entries attached to this cache.
This lead to a leak when multiple schema are loaded/created as, for exemple, in unit-test.

The problem was discovered when modifying the importer to make it use heap memory by default. The importer buffer allocation failed because of this leak.
