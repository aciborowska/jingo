This doc bug is in parallel with OPENDJ-3614.  The docs should explicitly state that the same --hostname value must be used to dsreplication disable --disableAll --hostname XXX that was used with dsreplication enable --hostname XXX.  

It should also state if another -non-configured-value is used to disable, that disabling replication will fail on all remote servers leaving the systems in a broken state.

OPENDJ-3614: Fully disabling replication using --hostname <IP> only disables the local instance.
