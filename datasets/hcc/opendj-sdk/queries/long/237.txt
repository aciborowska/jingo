Reported by lambda_x on IRC channel.
Reproduced on stock OpenDJ with the following modification:
$ bin/ldapmodify  -p 1389 -D cn=directory\ manager -w secret12
dn: uid=user.2,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
delete: userPassword
-
add: userPassword
userPassword: Password2

Processing MODIFY request for uid=user.2,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
MODIFY operation failed
Result Code:  53 (Unwilling to Perform)
Additional Information:  The password change would result in multiple password values in the user entry, which is not allowed

This is incorrect, the delete should remove all passwords.
Likewise, doing the following modification fails:


$ bin/ldapmodify  -p 1389 -D cn=directory\ manager -w secret12dn: uid=user.2,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
delete: userPassword
userPassword:

MODIFY operation failed

Additional Information:  The password change would result in multiple password values in the user entry, which is not allowed

But doing the same modification with all cleartext passwords works: 


 bin/ldapmodify  -p 1389 -D cn=directory\ manager -w secret12dn: uid=user.2,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
delete: userPassword
userPassword: password

userPassword: userPass2
