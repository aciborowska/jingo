When checking the XML for the (generated) schema reference, the doc build fails due to multiple occurrences of ID value 's-OctetString'.

Indeed the resulting XML includes the same syntax page, which has xml:id="s-OctetString", multiple times in the chapter on syntaxes:


            <xinclude:include href="s-ObjectClassDescription.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OctetString.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OctetString.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OctetString.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OctetString.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OctetString.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OctetString.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OctetString.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OctetString.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OctetString.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OctetString.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OctetString.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OctetString.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OctetString.xml" />
            <xinclude:include href="s-OID.xml" />


The Schema Reference can be built only against a running server, so it is not necessarily surprising that bugs like this would go unnoticed when nobody is building the docs.
