Found with rev (752bc265680)

When upgrading a server from 2.6.4 to 7.0.0, at the end of a successful upgrade, we had previously:

...
>>>> OpenDJ configuration was successfully upgraded from version 2.6.4.f592aaaf8de0617e45315a9c54ccfcfea07e3f64 to 7.0.0.cd031467a8819c76f845ec89eb9c1759016798e8 
>>>> OpenDJ data was successfully upgraded from version 6.0.0 to 7.0.0.cd031467a8819c76f845ec89eb9c1759016798e8
...

 

Now the configuration message is missing, though everything seems to have been upgraded just fine. We only have:


>>>> OpenDJ data was successfully upgraded from version 6.0.0 to 7.0.0.752bc26568072055f8c8ac3b43586645f636aa17
