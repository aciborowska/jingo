Previous version of ldapmodify used to have a -a option to support adding entries from a plain LDIF file (for example the output of a Search operation).

The -a option has been removed on the promise that the tool would detect if a changetype was missing and would then default to add the record.

This does not work :

Â 

$ ldapmodify -D cn=directory\ manager -w secret12 -p 1389 /Space/Tests/TestData/collectives.ldif

	An error occurred while attempting to read the contents of LDIF file(s): Unable to parse LDIF change record starting at line 1 with distinguished name "cn=collective1,dc=example,dc=comobjectClass: topobjectClass: subentryobjectClass: collectiveAttributeSubentryobjectClass: extensibleObjectcn: collective1description" because there was no change type
