Every time I force an account into lockout (by incorrectly enter the password many times) I receive the below error messags in the error log and no email is sent to the user.  Please help, we need to notify the user.  

I have already followed this (https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENDJ-305) issue with no successful results.

My ERROR MESSAGE in /opt/opendj/logs/errors

[25/Sep/2014:16:16:53 -0700] category=EXTENSIONS severity=SEVERE_ERROR msgID=1311278 msg=An error occurred while attempting to send an account status notification message for notification type account-temporarily-locked for user entry emailAddress=joe@smo.com,ou=Customers,dc=example,dc=com:  SendFailedException(Invalid Addresses)

Thanks
