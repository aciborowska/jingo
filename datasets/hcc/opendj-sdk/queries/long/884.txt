When I use logrotate to rotate the server.out logs on a Linux system, then use kill -QUIT to take a thread dump, server.out has nulls at the beginning of the file.

The problem is similar to this issue from stackoverflow:

I was able to fix it by changing line 108 of resource/bin/start-ds to use the ">>" redirect operator instead of the ">" redirect operator.
