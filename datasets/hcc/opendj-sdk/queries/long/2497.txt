The scenario is simple:

	Setup OpenDJ 3.0.0 rev 298372e2f7a605c4e8afe7cd6e7f61025b28db3e
	Create Rotation Policy with size-limit 14 kb for instance
	Enable CA log publisher with Rotation policies (by default it's enabled retention policy with max file count == 10)
	Provide series of ldapsearch and dsconfig get-log-publisher-property commands to increase log file size
	After that I was able to notice just one ldap-access.csv log file under log directory with Size 193kb.



To quickly reproduce run attached script.
