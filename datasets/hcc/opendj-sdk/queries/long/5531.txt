It seems that AM expects to findÂ ou=people and ou=groups under the base DN (such as dc=identity,dc=example,dc=com).

Otherwise, you get errors when attempting to create users and groups through AM console after setting up DS as an external identity store and removing the embedded identity store.

Users:


Plug-in org.forgerock.openam.idrepo.ldap.DJLDAPv3Repo: Unable to find entry: Entry uid=test,ou=people,dc=identity,dc=example,dc=com cannot be added because its parent entry ou=people,dc=identity,dc=example,dc=com does not exist in the server

Groups:


Plug-in org.forgerock.openam.idrepo.ldap.DJLDAPv3Repo: Unable to find entry: Entry cn=test,ou=groups,dc=identity,dc=example,dc=com cannot be added because its parent entry ou=groups,dc=identity,dc=example,dc=com does not exist in the server
