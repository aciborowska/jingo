If you pass --useJavaKeystore /path/to/my.jks to setup, it configures the normal JKS Key Manager Provider to use the above keystore. The LDAP/LDAPS connection handlers use this key manager provider.

However it does not alter the administration connector, which always gets configured to use config/admin-keystore etc.

The documentation should mention this clearly. It currently just says it changes the "server certificate" which is slightly misleading.
