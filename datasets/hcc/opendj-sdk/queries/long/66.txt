Configuration:

RS1 - group1
RS2 - group2
RS3 - group3

DS1 - group1

Normal replication (not assured).

In this configuration DS1 should prefer RS1. However, if RS1 is unreachable it should switch to another RS in a different group I think. Currently it doesn't: an error is reported indicating that no replication servers are available even though RS2 and RS3 are available.
