While testing IDM's integration with OpenDJ 6.0.0-M117.1 we discovered (OPENIDM-10132) that HSM support for keystores and truststores is broken. The code in DJ assumes that all keystores are file-based and FileNotFound execeptions are thrown in at least two places.

See the following places that DJ initializes keystore support:

	org.forgerock.opendj.security.KeyManagers#jvmDefaultKeyStore
	com.forgerock.opendj.cli.LdapClientProvider.ConnectionCommandLineArguments#resolveKeyManager



I am uncertain what the impact on truststores is, but they may be similarly affected.

We have code in ForgeRock Commons for loading keystores that works correctly for both file-based and HSM based. This is the code that IDM uses:



try {
            keyStore = new org.forgerock.security.keystore.KeyStoreBuilder()
                    .withKeyStoreType(keyStoreType)
                    .withProvider(keyStoreProvider)
                    .withPassword(keyStorePassword)
                    .withKeyStoreFile(keyStoreFile)
                    .build();
} catch (final FileNotFoundException e) {
     // ...
}



See the following, which mentions that when using a HSM keystore that the javax.net.ssl.keyStore property is set to NONE which is the value that is causing exceptions to be thrown in DJ.
