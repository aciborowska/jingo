When the server is setup for production mode, the following password policy flags should be set to true to avoid exposing the client credentials in clear text:

	[ds-cfg-require-secure-authentication = true] to enforce secure authentication
	[ds-cfg-require-secure-password-changes = true] to enforce secure password change



Currently, production mode enforces this security rule only when a user is performing an authentication and is associated with the Root Password Policy.
