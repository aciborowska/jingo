When there is a connection pool that is only used for bind operations it is possible that the user just performed a bind is required to change his password. This basically means that a heartbeat request as that user will fail with the following warning message:


Oct 02, 2013 10:25:02 PM org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.HeartBeatConnectionFactory$ConnectionImpl$1 handleErrorResult
WARNING: Heartbeat failed for connection factory 'LDAPConnectionFactory(openidm.test.com/127.0.0.1:389)': Constraint Violation: uid=nbelaevski,ou=users,ou=McKesson,ou=organizations,dc=mhs,dc=com must change their password before it will be allowed to request any other operations

The HBCF should probably just ignore this error result and consider the connection as alive (since it got back a response from the server, even though it was about an error).
