RFC 4511 4.5.1.7 says

Servers MUST NOT return errors if attribute descriptions or matching rule ids are not recognized [...]

However if you do this search with the unknown matching rule rugbyMatch:


ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -b dc=example,dc=com -s sub "(cn:rugbyMatch:=1)" 1.1



The server will return:


SEARCH operation failed
Result Code:  80 (Other)
Additional Information:  org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.schema.UnknownSchemaElementException: No matching rule with name or OID "rugbyMatch" exists in the schema



This violates the above text from the RFC. The server should be returning no results with a return code of 0.
