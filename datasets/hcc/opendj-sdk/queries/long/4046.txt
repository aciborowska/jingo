In few corner cases (not all), when an error has been made by a user with the command line arguments, following tools are printing the full usage after the error message:


	dsreplication
	manage-account
	status



Sample below:


opendj-ds/bin/dsreplication configure --host1 gaetan-laptop --port1 40444 --bindDn1 "cn=Directory Manager" --bindPassword1 password --host2 gaetan-laptop --port2 41444 --bindDn2 "cn=Directory Manager" --bindPassword2 password --noReplicationServer1 --replicationPort1 8989 --replicationPort2 9989 --onlyReplicationServer2 --baseDn dc=example,dc=com --adminUid "cn=Directory Manager" --adminPassword "admin" --trustAll --no-prompt
You may not provide both the --replicationPort1 and the --noReplicationServer1
arguments
Usage:  dsreplication  {options} configure {options}
Updates the configuration of the servers to replicate the data under the
specified base DN.  If one of the specified servers is already replicating the
data under the base DN with other servers, executing this subcommand will
update the configuration of all the servers (so it is sufficient to execute the
command line once for each server we add to the replication topology)


Global Options:
    See "dsreplication --help"

SubCommand Options:
--bindDn2 {bindDN}
    DN to use to bind to the second server whose contents will be replicated.
    If not specified the global administrator will be used to bind
    Default value: cn=Directory Manager
--bindPassword1 {bindPassword}
    Password to use to bind to the first server whose contents will be
    replicated.  If no bind DN was specified for the first server the password
    of the global administrator will be used to bind
--bindPassword2 {bindPassword}
    Password to use to bind to the second server whose contents will be
    replicated.  If no bind DN was specified for the second server the password
    of the global administrator will be used to bind
--bindPasswordFile1 {bindPasswordFile}
    File containing the password to use to bind to the first server whose
    contents will be replicated.  If no bind DN was specified for the first
    server the password of the global administrator will be used to bind
-D, --bindDn1 {bindDN}
    DN to use to bind to the first server whose contents will be replicated.
    If not specified the global administrator will be used to bind
    Default value: cn=Directory Manager
-F, --bindPasswordFile2 {bindPasswordFile}
    File containing the password to use to bind to the second server whose
    contents will be replicated.  If no bind DN was specified for the second
    server the password of the global administrator will be used to bind
-h, --host1 {host}
    Fully qualified host name or IP address of the first server whose contents
    will be replicated
    Default value: gaetan-laptop
--noReplicationServer1
    Do not configure a replication port or change log on the first server. The
    first server will contain replicated data but will not contain a change log
    of modifications made to the replicated data. Note that each replicated
    topology must contain at least two servers with a change log to avoid a
    single point of failure
--noReplicationServer2
    Do not configure a replication port or change log on the second server. The
    second server will contain replicated data but will not contain a change
    log of modifications made to the replicated data. Note that each replicated
    topology must contain at least two servers with a change log to avoid a
    single point of failure
--noSchemaReplication
    Do not replicate the schema between the servers
-O, --host2 {host}
    Fully qualified host name or IP address of the second server whose contents
    will be replicated
    Default value: gaetan-laptop
--onlyReplicationServer1
    Configure only a change log and replication port on the first server.  The
    first server will not contain replicated data, but will contain a change
    log of the modifications made to the replicated data on other servers
--onlyReplicationServer2
    Configure only a change log and replication port on the second server.  The
    second server will not contain replicated data, but will contain a change
    log of the modifications made to the replicated data on other servers
-p, --port1 {port}
    Directory server administration port number of the first server whose
    contents will be replicated
--port2 {port}
    Directory server administration port number of the second server whose
    contents will be replicated
-r, --replicationPort1 {port}
    Port that will be used by the replication mechanism in the first server to
    communicate with the other servers.  You have to specify this option only
    if replication was not previously configured in the first server
-R, --replicationPort2 {port}
    Port that will be used by the replication mechanism in the second server to
    communicate with the other servers.  You have to specify this option only
    if replication was not previously configured in the second server
-S, --skipPortCheck
    Skip the check to determine whether the specified replication ports are
    usable
--secureReplication1
    Specifies whether the communication through the replication port of the
    first server is encrypted or not.  This option will only be taken into
    account the first time replication is configured on the first server
--secureReplication2
    Specifies whether the communication through the replication port of the
    second server is encrypted or not.  This option will only be taken into
    account the first time replication is configured on the second server
--useSecondServerAsSchemaSource
    Use the second server to initialize the schema of the first server.  If
    this option nor option --noSchemaReplication are specified the schema of
    the first server will be used to initialize the schema of the second server



This is minor but led the user to have a bad experience, especially when usage is verbose as in this sample.
We should only print the usage command reference as we usually do.
