Scenario
I tried to do a request for api description of default endpoint (users) on rest2ldap gateway and I was expecting some data in response output. However the output was "null".

I tried two application servers (Tomcat 7 and Jetty 8).

Current behavior
Request on Jetty 8 or Tomcat 7 like:

http://pyforge.example.com:8082/api/users/?_crestApi


produces this output:

=======================
Receiving HTTP Response
=======================
status code: 200
content: 
null



Request on Tomcat 7 or Jetty 8 like:

http://pyforge.example.com:8087/api/users/?_api


produces this output:

=======================
Receiving HTTP Response
=======================
status code: 501
content: 
null



Doing the same with embedded mode I receive json or swagger in the output.

Expected behavior
I expect same output like with embedded mode.

The expectation is based on OPENDJ-3103 issue's description.
The issue says:

API is accessible for the default DJ endpoints:
 - /api (configurable by user)
       - both embedded HTTP connection handler and Rest2LDAP gateway
