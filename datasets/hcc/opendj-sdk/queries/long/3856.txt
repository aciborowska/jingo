Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev 97b73b33b7dd3983dedcb947a01b1e7e9f37d165

I tried to run the setup in interactive mode on Windows and the tool did not produce any output or error.

C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\opendj>set OPENDJ_JAVA_HOME=C:\jdk1.8.0_51
C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\opendj>.\setup.bat

C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\opendj>



The issue is only with interactive mode, asking for help menu works fine:

C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\opendj>.\setup.bat --help
