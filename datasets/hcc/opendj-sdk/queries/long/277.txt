I am planning on using OpenDJ as a store for MIT Kerberos as in:
https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/OPENDJ/Configure+OpenDJ+as+a+Kerberos+principal+store

But if I also configure OpenDJ to use GSSAPI for authentication as in the following link, I get an error during startup as the GSSAPI extension loads.
https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/OPENDJ/Configure+OpenDJ+and+Kerberos

The error I get is:
[13/Sep/2011:04:03:34 -0400] category=CONFIG severity=MILD_ERROR msgID=3342613 msg=An error occurre
d while trying to initialize an instance of class org.opends.server.extensions.GSSAPISASLMechanismH

If I use dsconfig after starting the directory to disable and then re-enable the GSSPAI extension I am able to authenticate against the directory using Kerberos.  This suggests to me that the error above is a result of the GSSAPI plugin starting before the directory.  When it tries to authenticate against Kerberos it fails because Kerberos can't talk to the directory to... well you see where this is going.

Could the GSSAPI plugin init be moved to after the database and ldap connector init?  Or perhaps the GSSAPI plugin be given a retry if the Kerberos server isn't available during startup?
