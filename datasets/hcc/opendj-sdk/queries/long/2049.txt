When using dsreplication enable (interactive mode), wording must be clear as to which ID to use.

Note: the following assumes replication is being setup for the first time and "cn=admin,cn=Administrators,cn=admin data" has not been configured.

1) launch dsreplication (select #1) or dsreplication enable to use the interactive mode.
2) Enter the hostname, port and trust information.

The user is presented with the following question.

Global Administrator User ID, or bind DN if no Global Administrator is defined
[admin]:

The information in the line above should be clear as to what is expected.  Entering in "admin" or "cn=admin,cn=Administrators,cn=admin data' fails because the entry entered, is used for a BIND to the DJ server.  Since both ID's are non-existent, the BIND fails, and the user is presented with err 49.

Before the output is presented to the user, dsreplication can check to see if the Global Admin id (cn=admin,cn=Administrators,cn=admin data) has not yet been configured in the admin-backend.ldif and if so, tell the user to enter the rootdn (cn=Directory Manager) ID and password for this question.

If cn=Directory Manager is entered, the BIND completes err=0 and replication setup can proceed.
