A purge command could potentially delete files that are being backed up.
Indeed, purge deletes all files that are not referenced by anÂ index file .idx while backup generates the index file .idx once all the files have been backed up.

One can imagine:

	some files are being backed up and the .idx is not yet created
	purge is run before the .idx of the new backup is created
	purge will add the new files being backed up into its files to be deleted and delete them



This use-case can happen especially when uploading big files in the cloud and the upload is taking time.
