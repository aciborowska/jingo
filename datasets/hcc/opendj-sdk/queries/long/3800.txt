HTTP monitor entry shows weird numbers:

ds-mon-http-put-requests-total-count: 0
ds-mon-http-post-requests-total-count: 0
ds-mon-http-get-requests-total-count: 0
ds-mon-http-delete-requests-total-count: 0
ds-mon-http-patch-requests-total-count: 0
ds-mon-resident-time-http-put-requests-total-time: 0
ds-mon-resident-time-http-post-requests-total-time: 0
ds-mon-resident-time-http-get-requests-total-time: 3
ds-mon-resident-time-http-delete-requests-total-time: 0
ds-mon-resident-time-http-patch-requests-total-time: 0
ds-mon-http-requests-total-count: 0



note there is a total time but counts (total and per method) are zero.
