Steps to reproduce:

	Try to run the following command:

bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=Directory Manager"





After a few seconds you will get the following error message:

The LDAP bind request failed: 53 (Unwilling to Perform)
Additional Information:  Unable to process the simple bind request because it
contained a bind DN but no password, which is forbidden by the server
configuration



Previous versions prompted for password before initiating an LDAP connection.
