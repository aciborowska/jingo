With OPENDJ-6055 and mainly OPENDJ-6057Â (that removes the ds-task-backup-all attribute), an upgrade task will be required to delete this attribute from any existing entries in tasks.ldif.
Of course it should also make those tasks continue to "backup all" if that is still something we support.

How to test? (courtesy from Cyril)

Test #1

There are backup and restore tasks in the task backend:


	A confirmation is asked before removing the restore tasks and restore tasks are actually removed.
	backup-all attribute is removed from backup tasks



 
 Removing 'ds-task-backup-all' attribute from backup tasks...........   100%
 Removing restore tasks..............................................   100%




Test #2

No backup nor restore tasks:


	No confirmation is asked



only this is shown in the output:


Removing 'ds-task-backup-all' attribute from backup tasks...........   100%



Notes

In order to have backup and restore tasks in the task backend, I've run these commands:


./opendj/bin/backup --backupAll -h localhost -p 4444 -X -D "uid=admin" -w password --backupDirectory bak --recurringTask "00 02 * * *"



./opendj/bin/restore -h localhost -p 4444 -X -D "uid=admin" -w password --backupDirectory bak --recurringTask "00 02 * * *"
