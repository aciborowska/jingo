In ConfigurationFramework, extensions are initialized by searching for a MANIFEST file META-INF/services/org.forgerock.opendj.config.AbstractManagedObjectDefinition in the extension's jars.

Unfortunately, this file is never found because the actual path used is /META-INF/services/org.forgerock.opendj.config.AbstractManagedObjectDefinition (note the initial forward slash). This path is also used for the loading of core configurations.
While it is necessary to use an absolute path for loading of the core configurations, because they are retrieved through a getResourceAsStream() call, it is not correct for the loading of extensions because they are retrieved through a jarFile.getJarEntry() call.

The correct approach is to have two separate paths, one for each case:

	/META-INF/services/org.forgerock.opendj.config.AbstractManagedObjectDefinition for loading of core configurations. Note that using a non-absolute path was working in a previous version, when the opendj-config module didn't exist. With the creation of opendj-config module, the file exists in a separate jar and the forwarding slash becomes mandatory.
	META-INF/services/org.forgerock.opendj.config.AbstractManagedObjectDefinition for loading of extensions. An jar entry can not be retrieved with an absolute path.
