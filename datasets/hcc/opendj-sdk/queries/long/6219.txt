While adding a prometheus HTTP endpoint via dsconfig command, the _ character is not properly taken into account by the regex in the excluded-metric-pattern property.

For example, when trying to remove all the ds_jvm_memory* metrics, the regex pattern jvm_memory.* does not remove them, while the jvm.+memory.* regex pattern does remove them all.
