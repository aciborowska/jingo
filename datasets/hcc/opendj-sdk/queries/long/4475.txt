The attribute value password validator, with check-substrings and test-reversed-password enabled, checks substrings in the "forward" direction, but not on the reversed password.

(Whereas the dictionary password validator does check substrings in the forward and reversed password).

E.g.

	given a user with "givenName: Aaccf".
	enable the attribute value password validator, with check-substrings and test-reversed-password.
	configure password policy to use only the attribute value password validator.





# bin/ldappasswordmodify -p 55389 -a "dn:uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" -c password -n Aaccf
The LDAP password modify operation failed: 19 (Constraint Violation)
Additional Information:  The provided new password failed the validation
checks defined in the server: The provided password was found in another
attribute in the user entry
# 
# bin/ldappasswordmodify -p 55389 -a "dn:uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" -c password -n Aaccfasdf
The LDAP password modify operation failed: 19 (Constraint Violation)
Additional Information:  The provided new password failed the validation
checks defined in the server: The provided password was found in another
attribute in the user entry

=> The above password is rejected because substring checking is done in the "forward" direction.
 (an attribute value matches a substring of the new password)


# bin/ldappasswordmodify -p 55389 -a "dn:uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" -c password -n fccaA
The LDAP password modify operation failed: 19 (Constraint Violation)
Additional Information:  The provided new password failed the validation
checks defined in the server: The provided password was found in another
attribute in the user entry

=> The above password is rejected because of test-reversed-password. (an attribute value matches the new password in reversed direction)


# bin/ldappasswordmodify -p 55389 -a "dn:uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" -c password -n fccaAasdf
The LDAP password modify operation was successful

=> This password is accepted, because substring checking is NOT done on the reversed password.
