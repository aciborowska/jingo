Running nullbackend changelog stress test, in which we set up replication with 1 DS and 1 RS, and use 
a nullbackend so that nothing is written in db, in order to stress the changelog as fast as possible, using modrate (replace description).

We set up a 10 hours load with file-based and purge delay set to 1h

Test start pretty well with an avg throughput of 28k mods/sec, no errors.

But after about 1h15 we get in RS errors log
[03/Jun/2015:01:21:29 +0200] category=org.opends.server.api.DirectoryThread severity=ERROR msgID=org.opends.messages.core.140 msg=An uncaught exception during processing for thread Change number indexer has caused it to terminate abnormally. The stack trace for that exception is: NullPointerException (ChangeNumberIndexer.java:527 ChangeNumberIndexer.java:478)
[03/Jun/2015:01:21:29 +0200] category=CORE severity=NOTICE msgID=org.opends.messages.core.139 msg=The Directory Server has sent an alert notification generated by class org.opends.server.api.DirectoryThread (alert type org.opends.server.UncaughtException, alert ID org.opends.messages.core-140): An uncaught exception during processing for thread Change number indexer has caused it to terminate abnormally. The stack trace for that exception is: NullPointerException (ChangeNumberIndexer.java:527 ChangeNumberIndexer.java:478)

and indeed modrate only gets errors after that.
