I did not test but this issue probably impact 5.5, 5.0 as well (and maybe also earlier version).

See the script attached to reproduce the issue.

Basically when the replication is configured and initialized while the DS does not contain the base entry of the replicated DN, the replication seems to be stopped because of a generation-id problem.

This usually indicates that one or more directory servers in the replication topology have not been initialized with the same data, and re-initialization is required
