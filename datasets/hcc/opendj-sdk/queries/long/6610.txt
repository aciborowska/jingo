30 of the doc non-reg tests fail at present on Jenkins where curl is linked with NSS libraries (and succeed on my laptop where curl is linked with OpenSSL libraries). The failures look like:

# curl: (35) You are attempting to import a cert with the same issuer/serial as an existing cert, but that is not the same cert. 

Although these failures are new in the last couple of weeks, and appear to happen with the new server implementation for the same tests that used to pass on the exact same Docker image for Jenkins that I downloaded a few weeks ago, the doc tests also broke they day I went out on vacation, and the daily runs never finished while I was out. When I returned and "fixed" the doc tests (so they all worked on my laptop), I might have changed something. Or something might have changed in the server.
