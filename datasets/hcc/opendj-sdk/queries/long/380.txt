Hello, 

Regarding the "index-entry-limit" of the Local Database Backend, the documentation says "A value of 0 means there is no limit." 
Some testing showed me that this doesn't really work.

You can quite easily reproduce the issue using the following steps:

1) Run Setup and create 4500 sample entries:
   ./setup -i -n -d 4500 -w secret
2) Run dsconfig to modify index-entry-limit to "unlimited"
   dsconfig set-backend-prop --backend-name userRoot --set index-entry-limit:0
3) Rebuild the index
   rebuild-index -t 0 -h localhost -w secret -b "dc=example,dc=com" --rebuildAll -X

The following search should match all objects using the objectlass=top filter.
(equality match for objectclass is configured by default in OpenDJ)

----------

	ldapsearch -b "dc=example,dc=com" -p 1389 'objectclass=top' 1.1
SEARCH operation failed
Result Code:  50 (Insufficient Access Rights)
Additional Information:  You do not have sufficient privileges to perform an unindexed search
----------



This error message indicates that there is no equality index for objectclass.

If I rerun Command 2) with a limit of 5000 and rebuild again, the search succeeds.

How can I get an unlimited index-entry-limit working?

Best Regards
Manuel
