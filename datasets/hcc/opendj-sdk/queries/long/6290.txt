LDAP client tools are supposed to read the bindPassword from stdin if the value is "-" but this fails:

opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 11389 -D "uid=admin" -w - -b "ou=identities" objectClass=top
An error occurred while parsing the command-line arguments:  The required LDAP
bind password was not specified. Either provide it using one of the available
command line options, or remove the `--no-prompt` option to provide the
password interactively

See "ldapsearch --help" to get more usage help


This problem applies to all the tools using the bindPassword argument.

We agreed we won't support this feature anymore and rely on interactive prompt instead.

This issue can be closed once: 

	The broken/deprecated feature documentation has been removed.
	The behavior change has been documented.
	The broken code for implementing this feature has been removed.
