With template corruption test I noticed that, when we corrupt a file template/db/schema/00-core.ldif the upgrade pass, however it shouldn't pass. The same scenario fails as expected with different file template/db/02-config.ldif .

Scenario to reproduce:

	setup an old version of opendj (2.6.4)
	stop the server
	extract a latest snapshot
	copy files from latest snapshot archive over installed instance
	remove the file template/db/schema/00-core.ldif
	create the same file without content
	run an upgrade <- this should fail with rc==1 and with a message saying the file is corrupted
