Moving the system clock backwards will cause problems in DJ, and I think we do warn about this.

It isn't widely understood that ntpd and ntpdate work differently: ntpd adjusts the size of a second so that time always moves forwards and there's eventual clock consistency; however ntpdate may decide to just move the clock to the past.

We should definitely warn against the use of ntpdate. Other ways to move the clock backwards are also problematic.
