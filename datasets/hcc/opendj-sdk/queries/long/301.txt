On stopped server:

	Start Control Panel
	Don't authenticate
	Press the rebuild indexes button
The process will stop the backend, but it won't do anything else. When you're authenticated the process will go further and will enable the backend at the end.



As far as I can see the used command does not require authentication, from CLI you would use for example:
bin/rebuild-index -b "dc=example,dc=com" -i uid -i mail -i cn -i displayname
So it's not really clear to me why is there a need for authentication, if there really is a need when using the control panel, then the button should have been disabled (like it is done at the manage indexes -> new index page).
