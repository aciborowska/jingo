With archive build with changes in PR: https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/OPENDJ/repos/opendj/pull-requests/4950/overview

I noticed that backslashes are ignored while importing data with setup tool profile ds-app-data.

Steps:

	unzip archive
	Run setup tool:




./setup -h pyforge.example.com -p 1389 -D "uid=admin" -w password --adminConnectorPort 4444 -Z 1636 --profile ds-app-data --set ds-app-data/baseDn:dc=example,dc=com --set ds-app-data/ldifFile:/tmp/aci_startup.ldif    -O --monitorUserDn uid=Monitor --monitorUserPassword password --serverId "dj1" --deploymentKey AI1QLGYmsSzDRjKDmQZu7l9sAD10aA5CBVN1bkVDC24LTccCYcFwGw --deploymentKeyPassword keypassword

output:

This was working with old setup tool. The difference is that before we didn't use the profiles to import ldif files.

To reproduce the issue you need:
 1. build archive for the mentioned PR
