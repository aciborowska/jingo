Found with OpenDJ 4.1.0 rev  (9fe9d00fbc8)

We setup a server and enable snmp handler.
We add 2 values in trap destination, one that is correct and one that should generate an issue:


./DJ1/opendj/bin/dsconfig -h localhost -p 4449 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X set-connection-handler-prop --handler-name "SNMP Connection Handler" --set traps-destination:myDestination -n

./DJ1/opendj/bin/dsconfig -h localhost -p 4449 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X set-connection-handler-prop --handler-name "SNMP Connection Handler" --add traps-destination:localhost -n




We restart the snmp handler
We stop the DJ server.
We create a trap listener.
We start the server again.
No traps are sent, no message are logged but we were expecting one trap for the correct destination and an error message in the logs for the wrong destination.
This is a regression (since 5th of may)
