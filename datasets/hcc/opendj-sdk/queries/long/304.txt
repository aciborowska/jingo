The unwillingToPerform result code should be used exclusive for temporary service outages, such as a backend being taken offline or made read only. On receipt of this result code a client should expect to be able to retry the operation on another replica and succeed.

In particular, the result code should not be used for indicating a problem with the request itself or the entry(s) it is trying to access: operation errors should be used for these. For example, attempting to set a new password which fails password validation should fail with a constraintViolation.
