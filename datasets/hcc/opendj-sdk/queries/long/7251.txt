When the schema contains user definitions in 99-user.ldif it seems only attributes and objectclass definitions are replicated when dsrepl initialize -b cn=schema is run.
The example of adding a custom schema from the configuration guide (7.0 version) adds an LDAP syntax, an attribute and an objectClass.
Adding those definition to a server prior to configuring it as source of reference data in a topology and initializing other servers with it will not correctly propagate the definitions as the LDAP syntax is not imported
