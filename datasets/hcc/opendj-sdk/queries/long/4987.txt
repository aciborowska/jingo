To reproduce this issue, you have to simulate an HSM token on the running machine to allow java to correctly load a PKCS#11 keystore.
This can be achieved using softHSM.
Then you have to link the simulated token created with softHSM to the PKCS#11 interface, this can be done by:
1. Creating a PKCS#11 configuration file linked to the softHSM library (on linux, it is located by default in /usr/local/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so:

$ cat /path/to/pkcs11.cfg
name=pkcs11Test
library=/usr/local/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so 



2. Then you have to add the sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 provider associated to the config file above in the jre security configuration:

root@laptop:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre# cat lib/security/java.security | grep provider
# Cryptography Package Providers ("providers" for short). The term
# "provider" refers to a package or set of packages that supply a
# the Java Security API. A provider may, for example, implement one or
# Each provider must implement a subclass of the Provider class.
# To register a provider in this master security properties file,
#    security.provider.<n>=<className>
[...]
security.provider.9=sun.security.smartcardio.SunPCSC
# Line above must be added manually (the provider number must be adjusted if needed)
security.provider.10=sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 /path/to/pkcs11.cfg
[...]


3. Finally create one or more key pairs in the HSM using the PKCS#11 interface with keytool

$ sudo keytool -genkeypair -alias pkcs11-softhsm-keypair -keyalg RSA -keystore NONE -storetype PKCS11
[sudo] password for gaetan: 
Enter keystore password:  
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  Test User
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  Test Organizational Unit
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  Test Organization
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:  City
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:  Province
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:  FR
Is CN=Test User, OU=Test Organizational Unit, O=Test Organization, L=City, ST=Province, C=FR correct?
  [no]:  yes




Then you can start running the interactive setup (sudo might be required to access the PKCS#11 interface):

$ sudo ./setup
Welcome to the OpenDJ 6.5.0 interactive setup.

Interactive mode helps you quickly set up an OpenDJ server.
Provide all required options to set up the server in non-interactive mode,
or use the command shown at the end of your interactive session

Select the type of server to set up:

    1)  Directory Server
    2)  Proxy Server
    3)  Replication Server

Enter choice [1]: 
[...]
Options to secure server connections:

    1)  Generate self-signed certificate
    2)  Use an existing certificate in a PKCS#12 keystore
    3)  Use an existing certificate in a JCEKS keystore
    4)  Use an existing certificate in a JKS keystore
    5)  Use an existing certificate on a PKCS#11 token

Enter choice [5]: 
Keystore password: 

The keystore contains the following certificate nicknames:
pkcs11-softhsm-keypair, pkcs11-softhsm-keypair-2.
You will be prompted for the nickname(s) to use

Use nickname pkcs11-softhsm-keypair? (yes / no) [yes]: 
Use nickname pkcs11-softhsm-keypair-2? (yes / no) [yes]:

Accept these choices and continue? (yes / no) [yes]: 




According to the print done if a file based key store is used, it seems that we are wrongly trying to print the keystore path:
