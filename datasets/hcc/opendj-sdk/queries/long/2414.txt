With OpenDJ-3.0.0 rev 90f97a8328fb2433989b4ac05dd565dc6b4db4bc

We setup 2 dj servers with replication enabled.

We use a non-root user to perform a persistent search on cn=changelog:


./opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1391 -D "uid=scarter,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" -w sprain -T -b "cn=changelog" -C ps:all "(objectclass=*)" 
SEARCH operation failed
Result Code:  12 (Unavailable Critical Extension)
Additional Information:  The request control with Object Identifier (OID) "2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.3" cannot be used due to insufficient access rights



We add the changelog-read privilege to that user and check out his access rights again:


./opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1391 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password  <<END_OF_COMMAND_INPUT                                           
dn: uid=scarter,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
add: ds-privilege-name
ds-privilege-name: changelog-read
END_OF_COMMAND_INPUT
Processing MODIFY request for uid=scarter,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
MODIFY operation successful for DN uid=scarter,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com

./opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1391 -D "uid=scarter,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" -w sprain -T -b "cn=changelog" -C ps:all "(objectclass=*)" 
SEARCH operation failed
Result Code:  12 (Unavailable Critical Extension)
Additional Information:  The request control with Object Identifier (OID) "2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.3" cannot be used due to insufficient access rights



In spite of the user having the privilege, he still cannot read the changelog.

In attachment, ldif file and script to reproduce the issue.
