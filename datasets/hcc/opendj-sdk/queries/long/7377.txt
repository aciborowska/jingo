Using DS built from the master branch this morning, when I try the build suggested in opendj/sample/docker/README.md (except that I'm using 7.0 as the version instead of latest), I get an image that builds, but fails to start:

$ docker run --rm -it ds:7.0 start-ds
/opt/opendj/docker-entrypoint.sh: line 76: ./bin/ldifsearch: No such file or directory
diff: template/db/adminRoot/admin-backend.ldif: No such file or directory
diff: db/adminRoot/admin-backend.ldif: No such file or directory
The server cannot start because it appears that database encryption
was enabled for a backend when the Docker image was built.
This feature is not yet supported when using Docker.
