supportextract generates an archive with various information including the logs of the tool itself.

In 6.5.0, support extract used to show the date-time and a tag 'INFO' or 'ERROR' at the beginning of each line of the logs:

2018-11-13 15:44:53 INFO   Adding config.ldif


In order to make supportextract console output consistent with other tools, it does not include date-time nor the tags anymore. This also affects the logs in the archive generated by supportextract:

Adding config.ldif


This is a regression introduced in commit 6173cd886b0 as part of OPENDJ-5713

While the console output should remain as it is now to keep consistency with the other tools, the archive logs should contain the following at the beginning of each line:

	The date-time
	A tag 'INFO' or 'ERROR'
