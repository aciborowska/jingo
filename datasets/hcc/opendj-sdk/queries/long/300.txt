Sometimes the LDAP PTA failover from secondary-remote-ldap-server does not always fall back to the primary-remote-ldap-server.

LDAP PTA Policy as follows:

 >>>> Configure the properties of the LDAP Pass Through Authentication Policy

         Property                                          Value(s)

I would expect:

[1] create a primary and secondary remote ldap server as shown above
[2] ldapsearch OK goes to primary
[3] stop-primary (stop-ds)
[4] ldapsearch OK goes to secondary
[5] restart primary (start-ds)
[6] ldap search OK goes back to primary

If you try this a couple of time eventually get :

[2] ldapsearch OK goes to primary
[3] stop-primary (stop-ds)
[4] ldapsearch OK goes to secondary
[5] restart primary (start-ds)
[6] ldap search OK goes back to secondary (NOT primary as expected)

If i then do:
[7] stop-secondary (stop-ds)

ldapsearch returns invalid 49 (Invalid Credentials)

./ldapsearch -h gary-laptop -p 1389 -D "cn=LDAP PTA User,ou=unit1,o=People,DC=Europe,DC=com" -w secret12 -b "cn=LDAP PTA User,ou=unit1,o=People,DC=Europe,DC=com" "objectclass=*"
The simple bind attempt failed
Result Code:  49 (Invalid Credentials)

In access log for local ldap server.

But there is nothing in access logs for primary-remote-ldap-server.
