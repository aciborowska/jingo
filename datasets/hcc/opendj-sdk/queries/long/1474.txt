With file based changelog, the removal of a domain is handled differently (compared to JE) :

	the corresponding replica DB is deleted
	the ChangeNUmberIndex DB is not changed (in JE, all records corresponding to the domain are deleted)



Thus, it's possible to have no corresponding replicaDB for a given domain in CNDB after a domain has been removed. 
This can happen when searching on the external change log.
This case must be handled.
