Since 6.5 version, setup profiles can be used for server configuration customization.
When OPENDJ-5736 will be resolved, profiles will be the only way to create backend, customize schema and import data.
Each profile can create one or more backends.
Setup tool does not update the default behavior set for the db-cache-percent property (50% of the JVM) of a JE backend created by a profile.

Hence, if three backends (or more) are setup with a server and the user does not want the backends to share the same cache (i.e she/he sets the je-backend-shared-cache-enabled property to false in server configuration), then the server will no longer starts since OPENDJ-5901 has been resolved.

Acceptance criteria

	Close this issue as non fix if we consider this is an edge case and since JE shared cache is enabled by default, its the user responsibility to update the db-cache-percent property of each backend if she/he wants to disabled the shared cache feature.
	Update the setup code to first compute the total number of backends which will be created, then use this number (e.g N) to configure db-cache-percent property of each backend to be created (e.g 100/N) so that we are to never exceed 100%.
