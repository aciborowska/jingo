As reported by Warren Strange:

Using the lastest ds image (a few hours old) it does not seem to pick up the new java base image. Which makes some sense I guess - since :latest is cached
So I think we either need to build without caching, or each project has to update their Dockerfile to pin to a specific version.

The fix is to ensure that the ds-base image build always pulls the latest Java base image if one is available.
