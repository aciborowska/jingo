The setup tool has in usage information argument --version (-V) but if I tried to use it I retrieved usage information with note Argument -V is not allowed for use with this program .

To reproduce run this command before installation


/path/to/opendj/setup --version


Output:


An error occurred while parsing the command-line arguments:  An unexpected error occurred while attempting to initialize the command-line arguments:  
Argument -V is not allowed for use with this program

Usage:  java org.opends.server.tools.InstallDS  {options}
