Here my steps trying to update to 2.6.0


# cat /etc/opendj/instance.loc

# cat `cat /etc/opendj/instance.loc`/config/buildinfo
2.5.0.8087

# ls -ld `cat /etc/opendj/instance.loc`
drwxr-xr-x  13 ldap     ldap         512 Jul 26  2012 /var/ldap/informatik

# svcadm disable opendj

# pkgrm opendj

# pkgadd -d opendj-2.6.0.pkg all

# su - ldap

Changing owner on /usr/opendj takes us a bit further


# cd /usr/opendj
# chown -Rh ldap:ldap .
% /usr/opendj/upgrade

>>>> OpenDJ Upgrade Utility

 * OpenDJ will be upgraded from version 2.5.0.8087 to 2.6.0.9086
 * See '/usr/opendj/upgrade.log' for a detailed log of this operation

>>>> Preparing to upgrade

  OpenDJ 2.5.0 modified the default configuration of the 'isMemberOf' virtual
  attribute so that it is included with group entries. This was done in order
  to make it easier for users to determine which groups a 'nested' group
  belongs to.
  Do you want to make this configuration change? (yes/no) [yes]: 

  OpenDJ 2.5.0-Xpress1 introduced a regression in the ds-sync-hist ordering
  index. This index must be rebuilt after the upgrade has completed and before
  restarting OpenDJ. Do you wish to continue? (yes/no) [no]: yes

  The upgrade is ready to proceed. Do you wish to continue? (yes/no) [yes]: 


>>>> Performing upgrade

  Updating JPEG syntax configuration..................................   FAIL
No such file or directory
 * See '/usr/opendj/upgrade.log' for a detailed log of this operation

** No such file or directory




The logfile shows us:


[09/Jul/2013:08:35:25 +0200] category=UPGRADE sq=2 severity=CONFIG src=org.opends.server.tools.upgrade.UpgradeLog initLogFileHandler
 msg=Instance Directory:      /usr/opendj


So 'upgrade' is really using the wrong instance directory
