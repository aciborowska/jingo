With Nicolas's help I wrote a small tool which wraps the Log.dumpAsTextFile() method to dump out a replication domain as text files, to aid with diagnosing customer issues.

I observed it iterating through all the expected log files, however no output was written to the *.log.txt files. This appears to be because the LogFile.dumpAsTextFile() method needs to call cursor.next() before starting the loop reading cursor.getRecord().

After making that change, full output is seen in the text files.
