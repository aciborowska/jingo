With nightly build revision 8785, I enabled HTTP Connection Handler.
Performed a search on localhost:8080/users/ which returns an error.
After that, a search in cn=monitor fails with the following error : 
SEARCH operation failed
Result Code:  80 (Other)
Additional Information:  An unexpected error was encountered while processing a search in one of the Directory Server backends:  IllegalStateException(Null request object)
The exception is raised from within the ClientConnectionMonitorProvider (on the HTTP Connection Handler).
