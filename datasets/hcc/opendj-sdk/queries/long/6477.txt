Work on OPENDJ-6453 has demonstrated that the current code (or test code) does not handle well backends that are declared in the configuration, but not enabled, and without any files.

This issue can be closed once the unit test BackupDbTestCase.testIncrementalBackupOnEmptyDisabledBackend() has been reenabled.
