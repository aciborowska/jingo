We have already two running OpenDj2.4.6 Servers replcation enabled with each .
To add more LDAP servers we tried below two options ,but neither worked
1:Copy the old setup LDAP folder and started server here but facing replication issue 
2:Create new server, copy one extra schema file , change few attributes similar to the old server and enable replication but get the password policy of Administrators DN issue.

Please support on this issue as we are stuck due to performance issue we planned to add more clusters.
