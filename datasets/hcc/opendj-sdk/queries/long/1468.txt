A customer's 2.4.x system contained a config.ldif with a mixture of cases in ds-cfg-backend-id values. eg:

dn: ds-cfg-backend-id=ConfigRoot,cn=Backends,cn=config
dn: cn=Index,ds-cfg-backend-id=configRoot,cn=Backends,cn=config

This worked in 2.4.x. The upgrade to 2.6.0 apparently succeeded, but attempts to start the server failed with:


[15/May/2014:21:09:06 +0200] category=CORE severity=NOTICE msgID=458891 
msg=The Directory Server has sent an alert notification generated by class 
org.opends.server.core.DirectoryServer (alert type 
org.opends.server.DirectoryServerShutdown, alert ID 458893): The 
Directory Server has started the shutdown process. The shutdown was 
initiated by an instance of class org.opends.server.core.DirectoryServer 
and the reason provided for the shutdown was An error occurred while 
trying to start the Directory Server: Configuration entry 
ds-cfg-attribute=sunxmlkeyvalue,cn=Index,ds-cfg-backend-id=configRoot,cn=Backends,cn=config 
starting at or near line 317 in the configuration LDIF file 
/opt/OpenDJ/opendj/config/config.ldif does not appear to have a parent 
entry (expected parent DN was 
cn=Index,ds-cfg-backend-id=configRoot,cn=Backends,cn=config) 



It isn't clear how the configuration came to use two different cases (configRoot and ConfigRoot).

The root cause for the runtime failure seems to be the fix for OPENDJ-393 (r7588).
