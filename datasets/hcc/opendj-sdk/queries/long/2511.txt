I installed OpenDJ 3.0.0 rev fa8edbac2275b98a6f21659afe3fbc7f3d8fe6c0 with default setup options and after that I set Common Audit publisher with no retention, no rotation policies and no filtering criteria.

As next step I did a ldapsearch and tried to look at content of ldap-access.csv log. I couldn't see any message with record type disconnect similar like we have with access log. I also tried to specify the inclusive criteria with DISCONNECT record-type, but the result was same (no message with disconnect record type in *.csv file).
