To avoid code duplication and makes API more fluent, we need to merge these connection factories.
Here is the different steps to follow:

	Passes all constructor parameters of HeartBeatConnectionFactory (HBCF) and AuthenticatedConnectionFactory (ACF) in LDAPOptions.
	Creates HBCF and ACF constructors with two parameters: LDAPOptions and ConnectionFactory.
	Merges HBCF and ACF
	Creates an AbstractLdapConnectionFactoryImpl which merges common code between HBCF, ACF and GrizzlyLDAPConnectionFactory.
