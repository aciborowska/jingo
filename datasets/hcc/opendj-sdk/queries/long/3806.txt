Three tools mentioned above are behaving in a quite inconsistent way at the moment. Some statements are printed on stdout, others on stderr. Some are printed as LDIF comments, some others are not...

So they are not producing valid LDIF content.
We have to fix them in a consistent way, here is the proposed contract:

	Any user errors which occurs before reaching the server (errors with arguments, bad hostname or port number...) must be logged on stderr (current behavior)
	As soon as a directory server has been reached, all content printed should be valid LDIF  (meaning that errors message and progress messages will be printed as LDIF comments) on stout



This simple contract should help us to have a consistent and long term behavior.
