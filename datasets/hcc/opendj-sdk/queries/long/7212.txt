Scenario:

	setup several servers
	stop one server / make it unresponsive (with kill -STOP)
	run dsrepl status:




$ bin/dsrepl status -p 4446 -h localhost --bindDn "uid=admin" --bindPassword password --trustAll
An unexpected error has been raised during execution of the tool: 'null'


 

While we expect more something like that:

$ bin/dsrepl status --bindDn uid=monitor -w password -p 4500 --trustAll
