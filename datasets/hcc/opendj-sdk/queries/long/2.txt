While trying to follow basic procedure (opends wiki) on how to setup replication between two opends servers, I got an error:

javax.naming.OperationNotSupportedException: [LDAP: error code 53 - The Replication is configured for suffix cn=admin data but was not able to connect to any Replication Server]; remaining name 'cn=localhost:5444,cn=Servers,cn=admin data'


Steps to reproduce:

1) download OpenDJ2.4beta1 and unarchive it in two different subfolders (same server)
2) run quick-setup in first installation path, checking "this server will be a part of replicated...."
3) create sample dn and start an instance
4) run quick-setup in second installation (same server - different directory) choosing different ports
5) check replication checkbox and put data in existing server (for replication) textfields
6) installation asks for certificate, admin users and replication dn, click finish.
7) little while later installation on a second server fails with message above.

Installation is done on a single machine because of a need to port and adapter for our application from Sun DSEE retro-changelog to OpenDJ/OpenDS ECL format (aka ldap changes listener).
