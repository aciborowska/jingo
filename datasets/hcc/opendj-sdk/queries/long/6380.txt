When defining an already existing objectclass (accidentally or otherwise), for example a 99-user.ldif file is migrated, but the default schema has already defined the objectclass.

 

i.e. a schema file like :

$ cat ../db/schema/99-user.ldif
dn: cn=schema
objectClass: top
objectClass: ldapSubentry
objectClass: subschema
attributeTypes: ( temporary-fake-attr-id
 NAME 'myCustomAttribute'
 EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
 ORDERING caseIgnoreOrderingMatch
 SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
 SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
 USAGE userApplications )
 objectClasses: ( 2.5.6.7 NAME 'organizationalPerson' SUP person STRUCTURAL
 MAY ( myCustomAttribute ) X-ORIGIN 'RFC 4519' )

 

On startup, we get this warning message:

[21/Jun/2019:15:47:48 +0100] category=CONFIG severity=WARNING msgID=761 msg=The config schema file '99-user.ldif' generated warning when trying to update schema with its content: [Unable to register object class organizationalPerson with the server schema because its OID 2.5.6.7 conflicts with the OID of an existing object class organizationalPerson]   


 

This implies that the conflict was detected and nothing was done, however cn=schema is updated ("overwritten") with the entry, which now looks like:

objectClasses: ( 2.5.6.7 NAME 'organizationalPerson' SUP person STRUCTURAL MAY myCustomAttribute X-ORIGIN 'RFC 4519' X-SCHEMA-FILE '99-user.ldif' )

This situation could be considered admin error, but the warning could be clearer as to the outcome of the conflict.
