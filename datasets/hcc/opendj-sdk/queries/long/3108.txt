Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev e9cc1050a57

Scenario

	install 2 servers, import 100000 entries in the first instance and then enable replication
	check the data are in sync using dsreplication status
	add/delete one entry and check the changelog are in sync (ldapsearch on each server)
	run addrate for 1 hour on the first server (doing add/del random)
	check the data are in sync using dsreplication status
	set purge delay to 2mins (to force purge), wait 4mins and set purge delay to 10days and then check that the changelog are in sync



=> here the changelog are not in sync and we noticed that on the first server there is one change missing (see ldif for changelog in attachment)
