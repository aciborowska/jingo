After updating the config/java.properties and running bin/dsjavaproperties root is the only user that can run ldap[search,modify etc] commands.

The following error is generated:-
#/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -b '' -s base 'objectclass=*' namingcontexts
/opt/opendj/lib/_script-util.sh: line 160: /opt/opendj/lib/set-java-home: Permission denied

When I checked /opt/opendj/lib/set-java-home, it's file permissions are (600) rw------. 1 root root 6.2K Jul 19 18:29 set-java-home

Changing it to (644) cures the problem.
