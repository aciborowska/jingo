Command line tools such as create-rc-script and import-ldif require arguments, but when executed without only give an error message.

$ bin//create-rc-script 
An error occurred while parsing the command-line arguments:  The argument outputfile is required to have a value but 
none was provided in the argument list and no default value is available

$ bin/import-ldif 
Neither the ldifFile or the templateFile argument was provided.  One of these arguments must be given to specify the 
source for the LDIF data to be imported


Unlike the above, the dbtest and dsframework commands actually tells users to use --help to get information on the required arguments.

$ bin/dbtest 
A sub-command must be specified

See "dbtest --help" to get more usage help


These tools as a whole, should be consistent and display the Tool Usage  message.
Good Usage Example:

$ bin/make-ldif 
An error occurred while parsing the command-line arguments:  The argument
templatefile is required to have a value but none was provided in the argument
list and no default value is available
This utility can be used to generate LDIF data based on a definition in a
template file

Usage:  make-ldif  {options}
        where {options} include:

-t, --templateFile {file}
    The path to the template file with information about the LDIF data to
    generate
-o, --ldifFile {file}
    The path to the LDIF file to be written
-s, --randomSeed {seed}
    The seed to use to initialize the random number generator
    Default value: 0

General Options

-V, --version
    Display Directory Server version information
