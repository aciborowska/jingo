When viewing the schema with the control panel,
some attributetypes and objectclasses are listed as custom objectclasses when using a remote connection to the server, while they are standard when accessing the local server.
The difference is coming from the way the Control Panel is categorizing the schema elements when accessing over LDAP or files.
