Replication server normally reports duplicate serverIDs from replicas and stops replication handshake:

[24/Sep/2020:14:53:30 +0200] category=SYNC severity=ERROR msgID=54 msg=In Replication server RS(rs1, 8989): servers peer DS ds2/cn=schema and peer DS ds2/cn=schema have the same ServerId : ds2


At which point the replica is disconnects.

On the other hand, server version 7.0 does not, the logs for both the replication server and the replica do not show any errors or connection problems.
