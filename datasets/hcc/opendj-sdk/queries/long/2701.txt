Using 2.6.2 I used the status command to provide proper 'service opendj status' functionality to the init.d service script as follows:



status)
    STATUS=`/bin/su ${OPENDJ_USER} -c "${INSTALL_ROOT}/bin/status -s -n | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f 4"`
    echo "Server status: ${STATUS}"
    case "${STATUS}" in
      Stopped) exit 3;;
      Started) exit 0;;
      *) exit 1;;
    esac
    ;;



However running status -s -n in 3.0.0 results in:

The LDAP bind password was not specified and cannot be read interactively



I have found that it is possible to work around this by providing any (incorrect) password, eg:



status -s -n -w foo



Unfortunately this is not backwards compatible with 2.6.2
