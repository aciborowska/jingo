Got a deadlock when performing a modrate against a substring index:


	install server with 2000 example entries
	run 

./bin/modrate -p 1389 -D "cn=directory manager" -w password -F -c 8 -t 2 -b "uid=user.%d,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"     -g "rand(0,2000)" -g "randstr(16)" 'cn:%2$s' 

	modrate is zero...



There appears to be a deadlock indicating that we are updating keys in an inconsistent order. See attached stacktrace.
