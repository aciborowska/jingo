As indicated in OPENDJ-4330, server plugin developers need Javadoc for dependencies like opendj-core in order to complete their work.

We might also be missing FR commons classes and interfaces that our own SDK depends on.

The plugin API Javadoc should include classes and interfaces to the edge of the ForgeRock web of objects, and link to Javadoc for 3rd party dependencies.
