In the Install Guide (http://opendj.forgerock.org/doc/install-guide/#chap-upgrade):
***********
Chapter 4. Upgrading to OpenDJ 2.6.0
This chapter covers upgrade from OpenDJ 2.4.5 and later versions.

For upgrades from earlier versions, upgrade first to OpenDJ 2.4.6, and then follow the procedures in this chapter. See Upgrading OpenDJ Directory Server in the OpenDJ Wiki for details on upgrading to OpenDJ 2.4.6 from earlier versions.
***********

As mentioned in the first sentence of this section, the new upgrade tool supports upgrade from 2.4.5 so the user needs to upgrade first to 2.4.5 and not 2.4.6.
=> the reference to "2.4.6" should be replaced with "2.4.5"
