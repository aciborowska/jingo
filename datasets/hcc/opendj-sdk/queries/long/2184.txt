Found using OpenDJ 2.8.0

Scenario:
************

	install 2 servers, enable replication
	generate some changes
=> the last change number is for instance 36
	now add a new replica in the topology, enable and initialize the replication
	search  on rooDSE to get the last change number
=> we get 32 (expected??)
	add one entry
	on the 2 first servers, search with changeNumber >= 36 returns as expected one change (one change corresponding to the added entry)
	on server 3, search  with changeNumber >= 32 returns 2 changes (one previous change and one corresponding to the added entry)
