Since we've removed the call to dsreplication configure to just add bootstrap servers and take advantage of the self-registration mechanism, we have observed that lastexternalchangelogcookie value was not the expected one.

We set up 2 servers, with a replication port, one with some data.
We set bootstrap servers for each one and initialize replication with dsrepl initialize.

When looking at lastexternalchangelogcookie, we were expecting it to be empty but we had:

/Users/carole.forel/wks/pyforge/results/20200518-182618/replication_group2/ExternalChangelogBasic/DJ1/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D "uid=admin" -w password -b "" -s base "(objectclass=*)" lastexternalchangelogcookie lastchangenumber	
dn: 
lastchangenumber: 0
lastexternalchangelogcookie: dc=com:01030172289c8b3f00000007dj1;

/Users/carole.forel/wks/pyforge/results/20200518-182618/replication_group2/ExternalChangelogBasic/DJ2/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1390 -D "uid=admin" -w password -b "" -s base "(objectclass=*)" lastexternalchangelogcookie lastchangenumber	
lastchangenumber: 0
lastexternalchangelogcookie: 



To see that you can use ./run-pybot -nvs replication_group2.ExternalChangelogBasic -t add_entry opendj
and look in the report for debug info. (the test will not fail for now)
