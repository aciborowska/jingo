Retrieving cn=replication,cn=monitor from an RS shows inconsistent names.

The local RS appears to be named using the pattern:

dn: cn=Replication Server $port $host $rsid,...

Other RSes are named using the pattern:

dn: cn=Connected Replication Server $host:$port $rsid,...

It would be helpful if the servers were all consistently named e.g. using "$host:$port $rsid".
