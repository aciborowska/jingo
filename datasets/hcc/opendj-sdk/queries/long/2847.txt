The utility function for parsing LDAP controls from command line arguments in the toolkit/sdk does not handle base64 values as expected.



-J, --control {controloid[:criticality[:value|::b64value|:<filePath]]}
    Use a request control with the provided information



When the base64 notation is used the value is parsed as plain Utf8 and sent over the wire as-is. 

Expected behaviour: The value should be base64 decoded when the double '::' notation is used.

This is the same issue as OPENDJ-2626, but repeated in the newer SDK version of the class.
