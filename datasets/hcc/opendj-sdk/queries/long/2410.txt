To reproduce this bug you need only some installed instance of OpenDJ 2.6.4 or OpenDJ 3.0.0 .

After uninstallation with delete of all components the lib is still presented under opendj folder.


/path/to/opendj/uninstall --cli -n -a
ll /path/to/opendj - > lib
ll /path/to/opendj/lib -> 
bootstrap.jar
_client-script.bat
_client-script.sh
extensions
forgerock-util.jar
grizzly-framework.jar
...
