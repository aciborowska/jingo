http://docs.forgerock.org/en/opendj/2.6.0/admin-guide/#aci-targets describes the operator in a targattrfilters expression:


Here op can be either add for operations creating attributes, or delete for operations removing them.



That is not correct; the code in TargAttrFilters.java only allows "add" and "del". Trying to use "delete" gives a syntax error.
