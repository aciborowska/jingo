When starting the control panel, authentication is normal, but the application is unable to read the server configuration (NullPointerException) via SSL. Cerificates are correct and have not changed for three months (one year expiration).

Jave 1.6.0_31 on both ends, set up for JCE unlimited strength encryption.

There is nothing indicative in the logs on either the client or server side.

Is there a way to dump more debug information so I can see what it doesn't like?
