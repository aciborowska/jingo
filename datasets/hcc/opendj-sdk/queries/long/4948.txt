Certificate mappers look up data realted to backends in two cases:

	initialization
	Matching a certificate to a user.



In both cases backends should be initialized beforehand, (which for initialization is not necessarily true, at the moment), but more importantly during mapping only local users should taken into account instead of searching through ProxyBackend.
 It is TBD if we want to map users through a proxy.
