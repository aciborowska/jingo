Found with rev (69a619a7b36)

On windows, we try to use &{ds.install.dir} as a resolver directory for other tokens to solve.
In order to do that, we try to pass this token to OPENDJ_JAVA_ARGS.
No matter how we protect the "&" (with 1 or multiple \ or ^), we cannot seem to have it correctly solved.
The best we were able to do is the following:


set OPENDJ_JAVA_ARGS=-Dds.envconfig.dirs="^&"{ds.install.dir}
,"^&"
{ds.instance.dir}

start-ds.bat
