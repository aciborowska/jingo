ModifyRequests are permitted by RFC 4511 to have no changes. (And by the LDIF specification.) This is currently rejected in the server, but it might be a reasonable thing to allow.

For example if you included a pre/post read control with the request, the user might expect something to be returned. This would be a way to do a base object search and avoid a bit of protocol overhead.
