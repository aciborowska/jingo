When reseting the password from the Control Panel or using the ldappasswordmodify tool, there's no Account Status Notification raised.

To reproduce, you need to add an AccountNotificationHandler (enabled) to the default Password Policy.

This was done with the experimental openidm-pwsync-plugin extension which captures password change and password reset and print them to stdout (server.out).
