After installing opendj rpm, when removing it, some directories are still there, empty.

[root@raclette RC5]# ll /opt/opendj

drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Jul  3 15:12 legal-notices
drwxrwxr-x. 3 root root 4096 Jun 30 11:26 share

These directories need to be included in the spec file in order to be deleted at package removal.
