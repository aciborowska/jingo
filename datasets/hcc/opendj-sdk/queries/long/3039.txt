Schema.getOIDForName(), should be responsible for lower-casing the name. At the moment this method is inconsistent with the rest of the schema methods.

At a larger scope, it may be better if the outer Schema class itself converted schema element names to lower-case before delegating to the SchemaImpl. At the moment, the getOIDForName0() method lower-cases the name potentially multiple times which is annoying.
