Log WARNINGs should be reserved for "normal" recoverable events that are somewhat expected in a live deployment. These may include messages about servers leaving and joining the topology, network partitions, etc. The only network ERROR that is truly an urgent problem is when a DS can no longer reach any RS servers. In this case it is completely isolated and its durability is compromised. The DS will typically go into lockdown (read-only). 

Recently, the split DS-RS test has been failing during tear down with the following log messages:


[29/Jan/2020:21:26:46 +0000] category=SYNC severity=ERROR msgID=17 msg=Directory server DS(22604) was unable to connect to replication server openam.example.com:9006 for domain "cn=admin data". Please check that there is a replication server listening at this address
[29/Jan/2020:21:26:46 +0000] category=SYNC severity=WARNING msgID=23 msg=Directory server DS(22604) was unable to connect to any of the following replication servers for domain "cn=admin data": [24797, 5021]



As explained above, these two messages have the wrong severity level: the first message should be a WARNING, the second one should be an ERROR since this is the message indicating that the DS is now isolated.
