When attempting to backup a backend which doesn't support backup operation, the backup tool stops with an error, this is expected, but the error messages are not OK:
Example: backup backupable and non-backupable backends at the same time
Online: Warning then stops with error

./opendj/bin/backup -h localhost -p 4444 -X --bindDn "uid=admin" -w password --backupDirectory bak --backendId monitor --backendId adminRoot
[02/Aug/2019:14:35:59 +0200] severity="WARNING" msgCount=1 msgID=org.opends.messages.tool-278 message="Backend ID monitor was included in the set of backends to archive, but this backend does not provide support for a backup mechanism.  It will be skipped"
[02/Aug/2019:14:35:59 +0200] severity="NOTICE" msgCount=2 msgID=org.opends.messages.backend-414 message="Backup task 20190802143559609 finished execution in the state Stopped by error"
Backup task 20190802143559609 did not complete successfully


Offline: Warning then stops with error and error message lies

./opendj/bin/backup --offline --backupDirectory bak --backendId monitor --backendId adminRoot
[02/08/2019:14:39:40 +0200] category=TOOLS seq=0 severity=WARNING msg=Backend ID monitor was included in the set of backends to archive, but this backend does not provide support for a backup mechanism.  It will be skipped
[02/08/2019:14:39:40 +0200] category=TOOLS seq=1 severity=SEVERE msg=None of the Directory Server backends are configured with the requested backend ID "monitor"



Expected behavior 
There should not be a warning because the tool will fail anyway and the error message should clearly say that the backend does not support backup operations.
