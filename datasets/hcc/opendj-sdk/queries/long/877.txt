I setup the environment variables and then executed the command "ldifsearch.bat" with or without parameters but I just received "The system cannot find the batch label specified - check".
I followed the logic and found it seems the command always ends up at the code below at _script_util.bat and there is no definition of label "check".
Once I changed the check to "end" the ldifsearch.bat works.

:isVersionOrHelp
if [%1] == [] goto check
if [%1] == [--help] goto end
if [%1] == [-H] goto end
if [%1] == [--version] goto end
if [%1] == [-V] goto end
if [%1] == [--fullversion] goto end
if [%1] == [-F] goto end
shift
goto isVersionOrHelp
