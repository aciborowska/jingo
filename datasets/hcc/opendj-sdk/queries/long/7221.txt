Found with 7.0.0-SNAPSHOT rev. 0493d588c76. 

After upgrade from 3.5.0 to 7.0.0 (above) I tried to run dsrepl status and I hit the NPE:

./bin/dsrepl status -h pyforge.example.com -w password -D 'cn=directory manager' -X -p 4448
An unexpected error has been raised during execution of the tool:
'NullPointerException(StatusSubCommand.java:252)'


Test to reproduce:

python3 run-pybot.py -v -s upgrade_group.upgradeTasksPart1 -t Pre_Dsrepl_Check -t Upgrade_Tasks -t Post_Dsrepl_Check DJ
