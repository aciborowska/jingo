The documentation says that to remove opendj software we need to do 2 steps:


sudo dpkg -r opendj
sudo rm -rf /opt/opendj



However when I tried again to install debian package with:

dpkg -i opendj-deb-4.0.0-*.deb 



it throws an error message:

Selecting previously unselected package opendj.
(Reading database ... 140448 files and directories currently installed.)
Preparing to unpack opendj-deb-4.0.0-RC1.deb ...

dpkg: error processing package opendj (--install):

The workaround is to use --purge argument like:

dpkg --purge opendj


which is not mentioned in the documentation.

FYI: rpm package can be reinstall as expected according to documentation
