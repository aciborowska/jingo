Running a --rebuildDegraded when no indexes need rebuilding results in a hard exception. If this was scheduled as an online task, then the backend is therefore not brought back online, even though it would have been in a 'healthy' state.



[10/11/2015:23:37:55 +0000] category=PLUGGABLE seq=28 severity=INFO msg=Rebuild of all degraded indexes started with 10002 total entries to process
[10/11/2015:23:37:55 +0000] category=TOOLS seq=29 severity=SEVERE msg=An error occurred while attempting to perform index rebuild:  IllegalArgumentException (ArrayBlockingQueue.java:225 ArrayBlockingQueue.java:210 OnDiskMergeImporter.java:2716 OnDiskMergeImporter.java:307 OnDiskMergeImporter.java:275 BackendImpl.java:806 RebuildIndex.java:559 RebuildIndex.java:321 TaskTool.java:362 RebuildIndex.java:228 RebuildIndex.java:138 RebuildIndex.java:110) (id=null--1)



As a user I would expect the task to succeed perhaps with a message to indicate no indexes needed upgrading, and then for backend to come back online.
