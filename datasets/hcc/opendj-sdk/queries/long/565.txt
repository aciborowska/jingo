Set up a password policy (or change Default) to include the Attribute Value validator.

Try and add a new entry. The password you provide in the new entry is always detected in an attribute of the entry by this validator (because it is in userPassword itself!) so the add is rejected.

Removing the password attribute from the entry before we run the validator on it will probably fix this.
