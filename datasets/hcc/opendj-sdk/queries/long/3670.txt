The setup man page is missing a <refPurpose>. The previous text was "install OpenDJ server".

This is visible in the reference at https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/opendj/doc/bootstrap/reference/index.html#setup-1, where you can see the <refPurpose> values for the other tools.

When the man pages are installed, for example with native Linux packages, the refpurposes are used for indexing. You can search them with man -k.
