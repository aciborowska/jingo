The setup directory-server --productionMode option configures data confidentiality, but fails to warn users who choose to import data that the data will become unreadable if the server is later configured as a destination server during replication initialization.

As a result, if the user does not carefully read the documentation before setting up replicas in production mode, you can easily end up overwriting the keys used to encrypt data on destination servers.

Until this usability issue between replication and data confidentiality is fixed, the setup command needs to offer a warning as temporary workaround.
