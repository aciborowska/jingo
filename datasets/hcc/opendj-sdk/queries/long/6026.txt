Starting with commit 91d85a0b668b44b72a3cafe1ab82469a115b0a06, tests are failing when trying to use DS as an external repo for IDM. During setup, it returns an rc of 1 instead of 0, but I couldn't find a more descriptive explanation for what was going wrong.

I'm not sure whether this is because test setup needs to be updated, or if it's an issue from the commit, so please re-assign as needed. An example test log with further information can be found here.
