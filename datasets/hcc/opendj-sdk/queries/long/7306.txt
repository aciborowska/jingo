While trying the distribution example, I kept getting a spurious message when importing LDIF for the proxy user:
[23/06/2020:11:40:36 +0200] category=CORE seq=0 severity=FINE msg=The backend defined in configuration entry ds-cfg-backend-id=adminRoot,cn=Backends,cn=config is marked as disabled and therefore will not be used
To reproduce the problem, try the attached script, test-spurious-message.sh.
