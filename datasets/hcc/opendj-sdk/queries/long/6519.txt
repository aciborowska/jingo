maven release build now fails on the 5.5 branch due to artifactory no longer permitting artifacts to be deployed twice. (Which is a reasonable restriction!)

To fix that we need to update forgerock-parent to at least 3.1.1. That also updates the checkstyle rules, which results in approx 700 checkstyle errors across the entire project.

As an alternative, it may be better for release engineering to produce a 3.0.11 forgerock-parent that only contains the necessary fixes and does not update checkstyle.
