In an attempt to build https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/OPENDJ/repos/opendj-docs/pull-requests/666/overview, I encountered the following new failure:

05:29:54 [ERROR] Error while processing: schemaref/index.xml
05:29:54 cvc-datatype-valid.1.2.1: 's-CSN(ChangeSequenceNumber)' is not a valid value for 'NCName'.
05:29:54 [ERROR] Error while processing: schemaref/index.xml
05:29:54 cvc-attribute.3: The value 's-CSN(ChangeSequenceNumber)' of attribute 'xml:id' on element 'section' is not valid with respect to its type, 'ID'.

This is a blocker for docs, since it prevents them from building on the master branch.
