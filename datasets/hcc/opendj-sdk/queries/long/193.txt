legalnotice.html gets generated in the same directory as the mvn command.

Should be under target/ instead so that it gets removed with mvn clean, and should be copied rather than moved to avoid mvn site then mvn site-deploy breaking for example.

Ideally this should all be in a skin rather than directly in the project pom.xml, but I will take one step at a time for now.
