To reproduce this issue, set up DS with "dc=example,dc=com" on userRoot backend. 


	Capture ldapsearch -b "cn=monitor" "(ds-cfg-backend-id=userRoot)"
	Run ldapsearch on baseDN "dc=example,dc=com"
	Repeat 1 and 2.



We can observes that some gauge metrics keep increasing until restarting DS.  Some examples of the metrics:  ds-mon-db-cache-total-tries-internal-nodes, ds-mon-db-cache-total-tries-leaf-nodes, etc.  It appears they should be of type counter.
