After IDM upgraded DJ from M1 to DJ M117.1, the throughput of create managed users with external DJ as repo or embedded DJ as repo has degraded significantly. With DJ M1, the throughput can be 300 users/second, with M117.1, the create managed user requests would timeout with throughput of 200 users/second.
Jim Mitchener did more investigation and found out that the issue is introduced when using resttoldap client from DJ M117.1. Test also showed that after we reverted IDM to use rest2ldap client from M1 but use DJ M117.1 as IDM external repo, create with managed users throughput change back to 300 users/second.

Attached are DJ logs when use the dispatch rate/throughput of 200 users/second and Gatling report.

To reproduce using Pyforge on PERFZONE machines:
Use IDM 6.0.0 master build on revision 05f855e or earlier, with necessary configuration, config.cfg attached and run the following: 
python -u run-pybot.py -c stress -i gatling -s *CrudManUsers -t IDM_Managed_User_Create_Put  OpenIDM
