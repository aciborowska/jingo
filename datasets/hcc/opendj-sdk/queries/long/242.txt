When using the password policy state extended operation (using OpenDJ SDK, directly or through the manage-account CLI), there are some inconsistencies with regards to returned values.

While most of values returned are representing the state after updates, some are not :
Authentication Failure Time
Grace Login Use Time
Password Changed By Required Time
PasswordHistory

The state after actions should be reflected in the response.
