Found with rev 8ac1e3b81e9

We have 2 replicated servers with data.
we use the dsreplication pre-external-initialization command on first server.
We import some data in this server.
We backup these data on server 1 then dsreplication initialize-all.
We add an entry on server 1.
We configure a new server to join the replication topology.
We use the previous backup to restore data on this new added server:

/DJ3/opendj/bin/restore -h localhost -p 4446 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X -d /tmp/backup_online2 



It succeeds.
But on this new server in the replication logs, there is an error:

(ERROR) [29/Dec/2017:11:16:05 +0000] category=SYNC severity=ERROR msgID=109 msg=An Exception was caught while replaying replication message : NullPointerException (ReplicationDomain.java:596 ReplicationDomain.java:2673 LDAPReplicationDomain.java:1976 UpdateReplayThreadPool.java:243)



we initialize all and everything is synchronized on all 3 servers.
