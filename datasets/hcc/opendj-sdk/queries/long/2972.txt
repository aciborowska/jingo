Doing the following in a OpenDJ Plugin



public PreOperation doPreOperation(PreOperationBindOperation bindOp) {
...
PreOperation.stopProcessing(ResultCode.SUCCESS, Message.raw("Plugin Bind Success."));



Doesn't stop the processing of the BindRequest. It still goes on to do further processing including checking the password.
