README file delivered with example-plugin contains references which do not reflect the reality. Apart from the references to OpenDS (and a very old version) it contains installation steps which do not apply. In particular, the plugin configuration not installed by injecting the LDIF file into config.ldif anymore, hence that part should be removed as well as the task in build.xml which copies the configuration file to the config directory. Instead it should contain the dsconfig command to create plugin and activate it.

Although the issue is trivial, the current README could be misleading for the developers who try to use it as a base to develop new funcionality.
