It appears that these issues already fixed in 3.5.1 are also in the 3.5 known issues list.

Perhaps the query to get the list of known issues is broken:


	OPENDJ-3337: dsreplication status on a DS, shows a DS+RS missing after the DS+RS is disabled/enabled.
	OPENDJ-3309: Replication server connection listener thread exits silently
	OPENDJ-3288: Upgrading backends with compressed entries results in unusable JE backends
	OPENDJ-3281: Modify operations may not be replayed if case is mixed on attribute values
	OPENDJ-3231: dsreplication status uses wrong bind DN
	OPENDJ-3230: upgrade: running verify-index on objectclass index incorrectly reports errors
	OPENDJ-3223: upgrade to 3.5.0 should rebuild indexes using DN syntax
	OPENDJ-3147: Regressions on Virtual Static Group membership checks
	OPENDJ-3133: dsreplication status reports M.C. (Missing Changes) when none exist.



Other fixed issues might be present in the list as well.
