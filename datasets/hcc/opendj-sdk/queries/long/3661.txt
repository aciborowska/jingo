The man page XML to roff conversion can fill up Java 7 perm gen space.

Failure can happen at about this point in the build:


[INFO] --- forgerock-doc-maven-plugin:3.2.2:build (build-man-pages) @ opendj-doc-generated-ref ---



What's going on behind the scenes is Maven calling forgerock-doc-maven-plugin, which uses the Maven Executor plugin to run the docbkx-tools plugin, which loads a bunch of libraries onto the classpath, libraries apparently need to convert the DocBook XML man-pages to roff-format text.
