When a proxy is configured with multiple shards, some log messages are confusing/redundant, e.g:

[29/Oct/2018:13:54:18 +0100] category=BACKEND severity=ERROR msgID=615 msg=Proxy backend 'distribute' is non functional because it could not find any primary nor secondary servers via the service discovery mechanism '[shard1, shard2]'
[29/Oct/2018:13:54:18 +0100] category=BACKEND severity=ERROR msgID=615 msg=Proxy backend 'distribute' is non functional because it could not find any primary nor secondary servers via the service discovery mechanism '[shard1, shard2]'

In that case, this message is displayed twice because the proxy has been configured with two shards. Problem is that each message also mentions the two configured shards.


We should review the log messages, decide if the message is per backend or per shard and reword it accordingly (i.e: adding/removing backend/shard name)

It seems that there is also another case during startup where base-dns are registered twice (one dry-run for configuration validation, one for real registration) which could lead to more duplicate log messages

[29/Oct/2018:13:44:44 +0100] category=BACKEND severity=WARNING msgID=624 msg=Proxy backend 'distribute' cannot register itself against base DN o=example because this base DN is already registered against backend 'proxyRoot'
[29/Oct/2018:13:44:44 +0100] category=BACKEND severity=WARNING msgID=624 msg=Proxy backend 'distribute' cannot register itself against base DN o=example because this base DN is already registered against backend 'proxyRoot'
