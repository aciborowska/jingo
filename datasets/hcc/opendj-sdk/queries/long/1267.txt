During 'dsreplication enable' the schema from host1 is used to initialize host2 and therefore can cause custom schema to be overwritten depending on which order OpenDJ instances are specified on the command-line.  This behavior is not well documented and results in confusion.

The existing dsreplication man page (http://opendj.forgerock.org/opendj-server/doc/admin-guide/index/dsreplication-1.html) should be updated to include the properties specific to the individual sub-commands, or a reference to an alternate document.  The only help available for the sub-commands is found via the built-in help within the command-line tool, for example: 

------

dsreplication enable --help

Usage:  dsreplication enable 
{options}
Updates the configuration of the servers to replicate the data under the specified base DN.  If one of the specified servers is already replicating the data under the base DN with other servers, executing this subcommand will update the configuration of all the servers (so it is sufficient to execute the command line once for each server we add to the replication topology)

Global Options:
    See "dsreplication --help"

SubCommand Options:
-h, --host1 
{host}
    Fully qualified host name or IP address of the first server whose contents
    will be replicated
    Default value: sunburst.local
-p, --port1 
{port}
    Directory server administration port number of the first server whose
    contents will be replicated
    Default value: 5444
