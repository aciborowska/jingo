We are using custom OpenDJ and We found that in one particular scenario We are not receiving mail for password notification.

I have been able to setup the proper config and reproduce the issue:
(Normal Working scenario)
When the user is in the “7 days left” period before its password expire, as soon as he logs in he receives a password expiry notification. I have verified that this is actually working fine.
-> There is a concept of grace period so that the notification is not sent before he logs in and that is expected.

(Not working scenario)
When inside this “7 days left” period the user enters a wrong password by mistake, then the ds-pwp-warned-time flag is updated but no notification is sent
-> As the flag is updated, when the user finally enters the correct password then the notification is not sent and so in the end the user is not aware that his password is going to expire.

Is this open Bug or did I miss any configuration?

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide

Thanks,
Harpal
