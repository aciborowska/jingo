In recent builds of both the 2.4 branch and trunk there have been many regular unit test failures. The start of the failures coincided exactly with our migration to new CI infrastructure, so the failures may be triggered by VM related issues like reduced memory or network latency (actually we've already tried several tests to see if these were indeed the cause and they weren't).

This issue aggregates the unit test failures in a single place for tracking purposes. The plan is:

1) identify regular unit test failures and segregate them in a separate unit test group (e.g. "jenkins-failures")

2) modify the Jenkins 2.4 and trunk builds to run all tests except the tests identified in (1). This should be done via a Maven profile and, in particular, should not impact the regular precommit/nightly targets which should continue to behave as before (these tests only seem to fail in our CI environment)

3) create a separate Jenkins build configuration which runs only the jenkins-failure tests but with debugging, etc

4) use the builds from (3) to debug and fix the broken tests. Once tests look fixed they should be moved back into the main unit test groups.
