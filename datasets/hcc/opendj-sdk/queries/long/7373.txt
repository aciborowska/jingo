Some dskeymgr sub-commands' usage puts some arguments in the "LDAP connection options", even though the tool doesn't not create LDAP connections:

a PEM file

    The CA certificate alias, must not already exist in the keystore
    Default value: ca-cert

    format, overwriting the file if it exists

    Path to a file containing the deployment key password
-k, --deploymentKey {deploymentKey}
    The deployment key

It appears many tools are using this method: com.forgerock.opendj.cli.ArgumentHolder#getStandardGroup(). It would be better if they were able to choose the grouping, similar to the setup tool. See org.forgerock.opendj.setup.cli.SetupCliNonInteractive.KeyStoreArguments#KeyStoreArguments.
