From OpenDJ Admin Guide:
The server uses the default Exact Match identity mapper to search for a unique match between the username and the UID attribute value of an entry in the public naming contexts of the directory server.

In other words, in LDAP terms, it searches under all user data base DNs for (uid=http-username). The username kvaughan maps to the example entry with DN uid=kvaughan,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com.

The problem with this approach is that there may be duplicate UIDs that exist with different BaseDNs. For example, each realm could have a different "admin" user.

Reproduction Steps:
1. Enable A Rest2ldap HTTP endpoint
2. Create 2 users with same uid, say uid=test,ou=People2,dc=example,dc=com and uid=test,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com 
3. Perform any operation as "test" user, i.e. curl http://test:password@opendj.example.com:8081/api/users/test
4. Result is:
{
  "code": 500,
  "reason": "Internal Server Error",
  "message": "Operations Error: ID string test mapped to multiple users"
}
5. The search works if one of the "test" users is deleted.

Expected result:
UIDs do not need to be unique to different BaseDNs, there should be a way to configure the baseDN for authentication.
