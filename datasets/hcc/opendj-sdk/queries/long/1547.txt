Example.ldif should be part of the doc build, because it is referenced in a number of places in the Admin Guide.

At present, it is part of the site. A newer version might theoretically be "incompatible" with older versions. (For example, something is added to take advantage of some new feature that doesn't exist in earlier versions, so while the LDIF remains compatible, the semantics don't match up.)
