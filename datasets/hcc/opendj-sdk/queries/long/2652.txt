I can hit following issue by running functional tests. Unfortunatelly I was not able to reduce the number of steps to reproduce the issue. I will attach a script with all steps.
Scenario

	Install 2 instances
	Enable replication
	Initialize replication
	Run pre-external-initialization on instance1
	Run import-ldif on instance1
	Backup instance1 data
	Restore backup on instance2 from previous step 6.
	Run post-external-initialization
	Add one entry on instance1
	Add one entry on instance2
	Restore data on instance2 from previous backup (step 6.)
	Import data on instance1
	Backup instance1 data
	Run dsreplication initialize-all  -> STOPPED_BY_ERROR (rc==12)



This is failed command on line 150.

./opendj/bin/dsreplication initialize-all -h localhost -p 4444 -b dc=com -I admin -w password -X -n

Initializing base DN dc=com with the contents from localhost:4444:
0 entries processed (0 % complete).

Error during the initialization with contents from server localhost:4444.
Last log details: [29/Jan/2016:11:20:25 +0100] severity="NOTICE" msgCount=0
msgID=9896349 message="Initialize Backend task dsreplication-initialize2
started execution".  Task state: STOPPED_BY_ERROR.  Check the error logs of
localhost:4444 for more information.
See /tmp/opendj-replication-8517443789251881283.log for a detailed log of this
operation.



Expected behavior, actual behavior and result of my investigation follows.

Expected behavior
I expect that command dsreplication initialize-all exits sucessfully with return code 0. 

Actual behavior
In comparison with expected behavior the command dsreplication initialize-all fails with error code 12.

./opendj/bin/dsreplication initialize-all -h localhost -p 4444 -b dc=com -I admin -w password -X -n
...
echo $?
12



Additional info
In error log file of instance2 I discovered a NPE: 

cat DJ2/opendj/logs/errors | grep null
category=SYNC severity=SEVERE_ERROR msgID=14942323 msg=Caught exception computing fake operations for domain dc=com for replication server localhost:8991 : nullNullPointerException (LDAPReplicationDomain.java:4707 ReplicationBroker.java:1091 ReplicationBroker.java:967 ReplicationBroker.java:806 ReplicationBroker.java:2470 ReplicationBroker.java:2894 ReplicationDomain.java:742 ListenerThread.java:97)



I checked in control panel the task monitor. There are log messages of failed task:

[29/Jan/2016:11:20:25 +0100] severity="NOTICE" msgCount=0 msgID=9896349 message="Initialize Backend task dsreplication-initialize2 started execution"

[29/Jan/2016:11:20:56 +0100] severity="NOTICE" msgCount=4 msgID=9896350 message="Initialize Backend task dsreplication-initialize2 finished execution"



The server with ID 24384 is the second instance:
Line 132 (status before failed command).

./opendj/bin/dsreplication status -h localhost -p 4444 -b dc=com -I admin -w password --script-friendly -X -n
dc=com  localhost:4444  167     true    6667    8422    8989    0               false

The status of instance2 after failed command is (0 entries):

The issue looks like OPENDJ-2341, but steps to reproduce are different.
