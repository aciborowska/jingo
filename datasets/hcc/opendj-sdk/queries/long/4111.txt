dsreplication purge-historical subcommand is meant to be launched on a local offline server.
When trying to run the subcommand in non interactive mode we got the following error:


$ opendj-ds/bin/dsreplication purge-historical -b dc=example,dc=com -n
The argument port is required to have a value but none was provided in the
argument list and no default value is available

See "dsreplication purge-historical --help" to get more usage help



The port argument should not be mandatory for this subcommand.
