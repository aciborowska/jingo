Reported by a customer on 6.0.0:

	replication topology with two DS-only, and two DS+RS instances.
	at restart, the DS+RS instances' error logs have thousands of errors like this (the DS-only instances have such errors too, but only a few) :





[20/Sep/2018:12:13:35 +0800] category=SYNC severity=ERROR msgID=9 msg=Internal Error : Operation ModifyOperation(connID=-2, opID=70, dn=uid=user1,ou=test,o=test1.com) change number 00000165c9ce8aa9005100114682 was not found in pending list



	the errors are for lots of different CSNs (and different DNs).
	many (or all?) of the CSNs have been purged from the changelogs.



Â 

I have been able to reproduce this only once so far (no consistently reproducible test case):

	once the error happens, it happens at each restart after that, on the same CSN.



My steps were:

	DS 6.0.0. Three instances: DS1 (DS-only), DS+RS2, DS+RS3.
	set up "dc=example,dc=com", and a separate backend "ou=sub,dc=example,dc=com".
	I set a global server-id for each instance (81, 82, 83).
	configure replication for the suffix and sub-suffix.
	add entries on all instances.
	set replication-purge-delay to several hours on DS+RS2 and DS+RS3.
	add more entries.
	lowered purge delay again on DS+RS2 only (this time to 1 minute).
	old changes got purged.
	restarted DS+RS2, and the "not found in pending list" error was reported on DS+RS3.
	after that, the error is reported on DS+RS3 at each restart of DS+RS3:

	in my case, the "not found in pending list" CSN originates from DS+RS2, and is the "newest-csn":
