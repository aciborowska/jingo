Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev 6c04f4cb5de809ea1b4e8deb12925396da89d841

Running ldapsearch with "External Changelog Cookie" control seems to have not effect, all the changelog entries are returned.

Scenario

	install 2 servers and enable replication
	generate a first change in the external changelog by adding an entry on the first server
	retrieve the changelogcookie
	generate a second change in the external changelog by modifying an entry on the first server
	now do a search with the "External Changelog Cookie" control using the previous changelogcookie
=> here we should have only one change returned (the one after the changelogcookie) but all the changes are returned



In attachment a script to reproduce the problem.
