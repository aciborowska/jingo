Regressions found in our daily tests:

We setup a server with some data and perform some ldapmodify/ldapdelete with the no-op control (for dry run).
It fails with the following error message:


./DJ1/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h nameserver.example.com -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w password -J 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.10.2:true 	
dn: uid=user.6,ou=ldapmodify,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
replace: description
description: This is the new description for user uid=user.6

returned 255, expected 0


# The LDAP modify request failed: 16654 (No Operation)
# Additional Information:  The modify operation was not actually performed in the Directory Server backend because the LDAP no-op control was present in the request
