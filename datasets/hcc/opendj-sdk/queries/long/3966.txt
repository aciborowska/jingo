The Bcrypt Storage Schema shows an invalid range and default value for the bcrypt-cost configuration.

The code states the valid range is from 4 to 30, but dsconfig states the range is from 1 to 30.



    if (log_rounds < 4 || log_rounds > 30) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Bad number of rounds");
    }






>>>> Configuring the "bcrypt-cost" property

    The cost parameter specifies a key expansion iteration count as a power of
    two. A default value of 12 (2^12 iterations) is considered in 2016 as a
    reasonable balance between responsiveness and security for regular users.

    *Syntax:  1 <= INTEGER <= 30*



dsconfig also states the default is 12, when the code states it is 10.



 * The amount of work increases exponentially (2**log_rounds), so
 * each increment is twice as much work. The default log_rounds is
 * 10, and the valid range is 4 to 30.






>>>> Configuring the "bcrypt-cost" property

    The cost parameter specifies a key expansion iteration count as a power of
    two. A default value of *12* (2^12 iterations) is considered in 2016 as a
    reasonable balance between responsiveness and security for regular users.

    Syntax:  1 <= INTEGER <= 30

Do you want to modify the "bcrypt-cost" property?

    1)  Keep the default value: *12*
    2)  Change the value
