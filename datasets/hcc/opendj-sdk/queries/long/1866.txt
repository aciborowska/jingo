This class contains many code smells and potential bugs which generally stem from the hidden state and relationships between the various member variables:


	null and empty sets have a different meaning
	isDefined returns true for some cases when the set is undefined, leading to some very misleading client code logic!
	multiple constructors with different semantics: consider using factory methods.



In addition, the class ImportIDSet looks like a direct duplication of EntryIDSet with the addition of some extra fields. Is it really needed?

I suggest focusing on EntryIDSet for now and then tackling ImportIDSet in a separate issue once the import code is fully migrated and stable.
