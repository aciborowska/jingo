Set up the default password policy with:

    4)   default-password-storage-scheme            Salted SHA-1
    5)   deprecated-password-storage-scheme         Clear

Create a new entry with a 
{Clear}
 userPassword. (e.g.Set up the import plugin to keep passwords as Clear and use import-ldif)

Do a simple bind as the new user.

During PasswordPolicyState.handleDeprecatedStorageSchemes() an exception is thrown and the migration is silently skipped.
