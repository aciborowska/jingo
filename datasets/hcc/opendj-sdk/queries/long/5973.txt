Since OPENDJ-5534, setup subcommand proxy-server is removed.
When a proxy server was created by the subcommand, global access control policies were added to the server configuration.
This is no longer the case with the ds-proxy-server profile which was meant to replace the subcommand.

Acceptance criteria
Bug will be solved when a proxy setup from the profile will contain the same global access control policies as when it was setup by the subcommand, global access control policies are:

	patch_to_default_proxy_config.ldif 
	patch_to_secure_proxy_config.ldif  for production mode
