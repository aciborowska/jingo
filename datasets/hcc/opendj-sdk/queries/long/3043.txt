When fixing issue OPENDJ-2987, we noticed that some of the attribute types used by the server are not defined in the schema.
For example, in admin backend, the entries created under cn=Servers,cn=admin data are defined with the extensibleObject object class and some attributes defined in ServerDescriptor.ServerProperty enum are not defined as attribute type in the schema.

It would be nice to identify which entries are using extensibleObject and then define the missing attribute types in the schema.
