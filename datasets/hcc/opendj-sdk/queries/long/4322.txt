The tools usage and as a result, docs do not specify that commands such as restore need options specified for use on the local server only and that remote execution is not possible.

If you launch restore with a backup contained on a local master to restore this data to a remote master, the restore fails as follows.

	I added the remote.forgerock.com hostname/ip address to my Mac's /etc/hosts file.  
	 Added a new DJ instance on a remote VM using the remote.forgerock.com as its FQDN.




Then I executed the following to run an "online" restore command on my Mac, but using the remote hostname of "remote.forgerock.com"


opendj; bin/$ grep remote.forgerock.com /etc/hosts
192.168.56.101  remote.forgerock.com

 


opendj; bin/$: ./restore --hostname remote.forgerock.com --port 4444 --bindDN "cn=Directory Manager" --bindPassword password --backupDirectory /opt/instances/backups --backupID 20170921184717Z --trustAll

I get the following SEVERE_ERROR message on the remote server.

Note: The backup.info does exist locally on the Mac, but does not on the Remote VM.
