cd into org.opends.server.replication and find all references to openCursor. Many of them are not adequately protected by a finally block to close them. This is probably why we see occasional errors due to leaked cursors in unit tests and in production (e.g. during server shutdown).

We should probably fix these for 2.4.2: it's pretty easy to do.
