With OpenDJ 3.0.0 rev f8d85405cc4c4c8385293459685503f451ee23b8
on windows.

We setup 2 DJ instances in a DSRS-DSRS configuration.
We stop the second server.
We perform a modify on the first one to check that the medium consistency point moves forward because server 2 declared that it went offline so other servers do not wait for it.
We check the changelog on the first server to check this change appears but it is not.
