When a RS is stopped in a topology the DSs switch to another RS, but then every few seconds each DS is trying to switch back to the RS that was stopped.

Topology, on a single suffix "dc=europe,dc=com" there are 2 DS and 2 RS each running as a separate server.

DS1: id=29755
DS2: id=19737
RS1: id=17664
RS2: id=24553

Initially 2 DS are connected to RS1
DS1    DS2
   \ /
    RS1 - RS2

When RS1 process is stopped 'kill -STOP <pid>', then the 2 DS switch to RS2. OK.

DS1    DS2
   \ /
    RS2 - RS1

But if you see the error logs for DS1 and DS2 you can see that each DS is trying to switch back to RS1 every few seconds.

error logs from DS2 (id=24553)

Note that RS1 (id=17664) server is not available as process is stopped.

The decision to know which RS is most suitable is is down to BestServerCheckingAlgorithm feature.
