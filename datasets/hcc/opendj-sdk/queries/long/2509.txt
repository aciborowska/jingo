The Csv File Access Log Publisher could not be created because of the
following reason:

    *  Unwilling to Perform: The Directory Server is unwilling to add
       configuration entry cn=my custom csv log,cn=Loggers,cn=config because
       one of the add listeners registered with the parent entry
       cn=Loggers,cn=config rejected this change with the message: Class
       org.opends.server.loggers.CommonAuditAccessLogPublisher specified in
       attribute ds-cfg-java-class of configuration entry cn=my custom csv
       log,cn=Loggers,cn=config cannot be instantiated as a Directory Server
