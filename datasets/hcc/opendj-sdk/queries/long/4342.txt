1) In Admin Guide, procedure 8.8 to install a standalone RS recommend installing a DS without a database:

Set up the replication server as a directory server that has no database.

2) In Install Guide, procedure 5.1 and 5.2 to install a standalone RS recommend installing a RS using the setup replication-server command

The second approach should also be used in the Admin Guide. Reference to installing a DS with no database should not appear anymore in the documentation, now that there is a direct way to do it.
