Although we build man pages & tools reference source in the opendj-doc-generated-ref module, we still have files for man pages under opendj-server.

As even I don't know why this is, it's confusing to any developers having to touch generated docs, and so should be removed.

One remaining question before deleting it all is why we ended up with variablelist-backendstat-index-status.xml in both modules. Need to reread the content of both before keeping the right one in the opendj-doc-generated-ref module.
