Object classes may be defined with multiple names.

One name is used when storing the entry. Doing a subtree search for the entry using the other name(s) fails to match the entry. Doing a base object search on the entry using the other name(s) also fails to match it.

This is a regression from 2.6.x. It is fixed in 6.0.0.

A simple test script is attached: test.sh. The 4 searches in the script should each return one matching entry.
