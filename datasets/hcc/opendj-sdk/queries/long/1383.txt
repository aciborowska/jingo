In a 2-way split topology (2xDS + 2xRS) I am seeing a DS which regularly announces every 2 minutes that it is failing over to another RS, when in fact it seems to just disconnect and reconnect to the same RS:


==> ds2/opendj/logs/replication <==
[24/Mar/2014:18:17:25 +0100] category=SYNC severity=NOTICE resource=messages.replication msgID=188 msg=Directory Server DS(8611) is switching from replication server RS(6224) at matts-laptop/127.0.1.1:9999 to RS(17493) for domain "dc=example,dc=com" because it is more suitable. The previous replication server evaluation was: "RS(6224) was not configured locally on DS(8611), but at least one other RS was", and the new replication server evaluation was: "RS(17493) has been evaluated to be the best replication server for DS(8611) to connect to because it was the only one standing after all tests"
