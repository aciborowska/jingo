The AuthenticatedUsers class updates the privileges of any currently connected users if their account has been modified. See OPENDJ-2659.

However, we should really do something similar if the privileges are being set via a collective attribute subentry - in other words trigger on the subentry change.

This looks difficult to do in an efficient way (how many users are in the scope of the subentry?), but it is clearly a bit of an omission. On the plus side, changes to subentries are normally pretty rare so this is only a minor problem.
