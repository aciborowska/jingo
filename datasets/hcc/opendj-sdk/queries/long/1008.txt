DS does not switch over another RS.

Topology is 4 servers 2 DS and 2 RS servers, each in a separate JVM. The RS and DS pairs are on a different subnet, separated by a high latency, low bandwidth network

So it's sort of like this simplification.

DS1                        DS2
RS3   <------ WAN ------>  RS4
subnet A                   subnet B

Network approx:
 bandwidth= 1.583Mbps      latency= 37.188ms

In the case where DS1 and DS2 are connected to RS4, when RS4 process is stopped (kill -STOP pid) then DS2 does not switch over to RS3. DS1 does switch over to RS3 in this case.

DS2 has disconnected from RS4, but does not connect to RS3.


./ldapsearch -h DS2 -p 2389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w secret12 -b "cn=dc_europe_dc_com,cn=replication,cn=monitor" "(connected-to=*)" "connected-to" "lost-connections"
dn: cn=Directory server DS(30036),cn=dc_europe_dc_com,cn=Replication,cn=monitor
lost-connections: 1
connected-to: Not connected



However when RS3 is NOT available, both DS1 and DS2 will switch to RS4.
