Reading the documentation I can see '???' characters. For instance here 
 http://opendj.forgerock.org/doc/bootstrap/admin-guide/index.html#chap-understanding-ldap  
Dictionaries typically have one index???words in alphabetical order. Phone books, too???names in

I tried to find another with ctr+f and I have found 17 matches.

The root cause is in Jenkins job configuration, where characterset UTF-8  should be configured. Looks like some slave is not configured correctly.
