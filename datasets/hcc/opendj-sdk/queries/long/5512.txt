We get this error in our full runs with encryption enabled, when starting a server after import-ldif for offline initialisation.


[18/Sep/2018:04:35:26 +0100] category=SYNC severity=ERROR msgID=-1 msg=Read timed out


To reproduce


OPENDJ_DATABASE_ENCRYPTED=True
OPENDJ_INDEXES_ENCRYPTED=True
OPENDJ_CHANGELOG_ENCRYPTED=True
./configure.py
./run-pybot.py -s replication_group3.LdifImport -t offline_initialisation -v DJ

Testcase steps

	Have a topology of 2 DSRS, both with databases, changelogs and indexes encrypted
	Run dsreplication pre-external-initialization on DJ1, stop both servers
	Import replication_startup.ldif (included) into DJ1 (offline), export it (also offline)
	Import export.ldif into DJ2
	Start both servers (DJ1 first), during start of DJ2, see the mentioned error in the logs of DJ1.
	Run dsreokication pos-external-initialization on DJ1
	Add an entry on DJ1, verify it is replicated on all servers
	Check replication status (0 replication delay, and ds-sync-state in sync)
