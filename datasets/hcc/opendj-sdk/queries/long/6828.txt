The SCRAM mechanisms have a hard-wired minimum iteration limit of 4096, yet this is only documented as "SHOULD" in the RFCs. We should allow lower iterations, even if they are not recommended. It should be possible for the client application to set the minimum iteration count they are willing to accept.
