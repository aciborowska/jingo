As I was trying to fix OPENDJ-3545, I noticed that when using PSearch, the server returns entries that are updated, but it doesn't return the EntryChangeNotification Control.
Note that returning the EntryChangeNotification Control is the default, so -C ps is enough to test.

To reproduce, on one terminal, do the following search:

$ ldapsearch --verbose -p 1389 -D cn=directory\ manager -w secret12 -b "dc=example,dc=com" -C ps:any:true:true "(objectclass=*)" dn



In another terminal, modify an entry as following:

$ ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1389 -D cn=directory\ manager -w secret12
dn: uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
replace: description
description: test




When modifying an entry, the entry dn is returned, but ldapsearch doesn't indicate any control returned with the entry.


$ ldapsearch --verbose -p 1389 -D cn=directory\ manager -w secret12 -b "dc=example,dc=com" -C ps:any:true:true "(objectclass=*)" dn
dn: uid=user.0,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com



With OpenDJ 3.5, the output is the following:


# Persistent search change type:  modify
dn: uid=user.0,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com





Going through the debugger, we can see the server ResultEntry has controls, but it's wrapped to the SDK searchResultEntry then in a Response at LDAPClientConnection2.java:544 and that's where the controls are not properly handled.



private Response toResponse(final SearchResultEntry searchEntry) {                            
    return Responses.newSearchResultEntry(Converters.partiallyWrap(searchEntry, ldapVersion));
}
