The online rebuild-index is asking the user to trust certificate before creating the task.
This is inconsistent with the online import-ldif which does not.

The rebuild-index should not ask for the user to trust the certificate when connecting on the local instance of the server.


./bin/rebuild-index -b "dc=example,dc=com" -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w test -p 4444 --rebuildAll
The server is using the following certificate: 
    Subject DN:  CN=ylecaillez-laptop, O=Administration Connector RSA Self-Signed Certificate
    Issuer DN:  CN=ylecaillez-laptop, O=Administration Connector RSA Self-Signed Certificate
    Validity:  Mon Jun 13 19:27:03 CEST 2016 through Sun Jun 08 19:27:03 CEST 2036
Do you wish to trust this certificate and continue connecting to the server?
Please enter "yes" or "no":
