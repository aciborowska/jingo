On receipt of a TopologyMsg, the DS attempts to connect to each identified RS, and updates the list of replication servers using the information in the TopologyMsg.

However the "URLs" in the TopologyMsg are formed by each RS using getHostname(), so the DS receives names that it is unable to connect to (see Environment).

A consequence is that all of the server names received in the TopologyMsg are marked as "not locally configured", which means they will be filtered out when calculating the best server to connect to.

The result is that the DS will not be able to failover correctly to all RSes.

Configuring the replication domain explicitly with hostname:port servers may cause the servers to be marked as "locally configured" however the DS will be prevented from connecting to it.
