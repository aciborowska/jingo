LeastRequestsStrategy select the server which has the less number of concurrent requests already assigned to it.
When all the servers have a same load (which is the case when idle) the request is currently sent to the first server of the list.

During startup, AM sends a request to get all blacklisted tokens. When multiple instances of AM are starting-up simultaneously, all these requests are forwarded to the same DJ server: the first one from the list.

A solution could be that when all server are idle, return a random server rather than the first one.
