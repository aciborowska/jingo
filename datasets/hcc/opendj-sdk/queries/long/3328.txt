The doc shows an example of creating a second HTTP endpoint with the same configuration as the default example.

When you actually try this with a recent build, however, it not only half-fails, but then also prevents the server from starting again after it has been stopped.

By "half-fails" I mean the endpoint configuration is created, but the command ends in an error with the following message:


The Rest2ldap Endpoint could not be created due to a communications problem:
Undefined

Attached is a short script to reproduce the problem.

In the tests I'm writing for OPENDJ-3102, I'm seeing the same type of error message when change the config to use OpenAM as OAuth 2.0 AS for /api, and then when trying to reset to HTTP Basic for /api. (Those particular problems are not reproduced in the attached test.)
