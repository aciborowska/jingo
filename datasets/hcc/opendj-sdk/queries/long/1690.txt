Found using dev branch (revision 11421).

Scenario
***********
1. install 2 servers and enable replication with file-based changelog
2. set purge delay to 1 minute
3. add 12 "big" entries (>2Mo) to fill 2 changelog files
4. search on changelog
==> 12 changes as expected
5. wait for purge delay
6. search again on changelog
==> still 12 changes but expect only 6 (corresponding to last changelog file)
