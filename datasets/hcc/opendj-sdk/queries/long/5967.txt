Found with 7.0.0-SNAPSHOT rev (63e46d21c39)
But we started having this recurring and random problem since rev (f62f2ebba1f)

We set up 4 DJs with data in a replication topology: 3DS/RS and one only DS.
We do not set manually the server id, so we leave the default one.
Regularly, when tearing down the tests, we fall into a timeout issue while stopping the DS only server:


./DJ3/opendj/bin/stop-ds  	
12:11:39.771 	WARN 	ERROR:
-- rc --
returned 89, expected to be in [0]
-- stdout --
Stopping Server...
The timeout of '200' seconds to start the server has been reached.  You can
use the argument '--timeout' to increase this timeout

-- stderr --
An error occurred while parsing the command-line arguments:  A port number
must be specified to connect to the server

See "stop-ds --help" to get more usage help



I was able to reproduce it on my laptop the one time out of 2.


./run-pybot.py -s replication_group1.BasicDefaultServerId  dj
