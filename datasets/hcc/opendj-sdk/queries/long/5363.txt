In preparing a DS/RS for a DevOps environment, I set up a couple of DS/RS and initialize replication between them. My intent is to use one of the servers as a template for servers based in the cloud, similar to https://stash.forgerock.org/users/matthew/repos/docker-opendj/browse/bootstrap

As the servers in different environments (dev, test, prod) will not have the same data, I don't expect them to have the same generation IDs. I therefore remove the changelog DB contents, rm -rf /path/to/opendj/changelogDb/*, when setting up a template server.

This seems functionally to work fine for a topology of combined DS/RS servers. The server can recreate the changelog DB files based on the backends as long as they are not empty. (All mine contain at least a base DN.)

But if I remove the changelog DB a couple of times after restarting the servers, I notice a warning message that suggests I might need to reinitialize replication:

category=SYNC severity=WARNING msgID=146 msg=Directory server DS(15843) at localhost/127.0.0.1:59540 presented generation ID 158113 for domain "cn=admin data", but the generation ID of this replication server RS(6545) is -1. This usually indicates that one or more directory servers in the replication topology have not been initialized with the same data, and re-initialization is required

Logging a notice message that the RS generation ID is -1 is probably fine. But it is misleading to state that "re-initialization is required."
