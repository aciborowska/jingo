It is not possible to move an entry between two different local backend, trying to do so produce an error with result code UNWILLING TO PERFORM (53) and an error message explaining that an entry cannot be moved between backends.

When moving an entry between a local backend and a proxy backend, the error returned is wrong:
result code is NO SUCH OBJECT (32) and the error message explains that there is no backend registered with the target dn.

The error code and message must be the same whether the target backend is proxy or local.
