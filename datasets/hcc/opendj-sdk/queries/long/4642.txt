When ldapsearch is used with server side sort (-S option),  the tool adds the ServerSideSortRequestControl with the critical field set to false.
That mean that the server is allowed to return the data un-ordered when unable to sort them.

Problem is that ldapsearch could be used in external tools which rely on the fact that the data returned are sorted.

It's better to set the critical flag to true so that the server returns an error code when unable to sort the requested data.
