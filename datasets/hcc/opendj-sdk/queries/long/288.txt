If a user's entry is deleted any client connections which are currently bound as that user will be disconnected. The result code returned in the associated disconnect notification is OTHER (80). This result code is very generic and makes it difficult for applications implementing fail-over functionality to determine whether or not the connection failure is due to a "service" failure (server unavailable) or just a "connection" failure.

To make life easier for clients performing fail-over we should close the connections with a more appropriate result code, such as INVALID CREDENTIALS (49). An alternative would be NO SUCH OBJECT, but INVALID CREDENTIALS is consistent with the error code that would be returned if the client try to re-authenticate as the same (missing) user.
