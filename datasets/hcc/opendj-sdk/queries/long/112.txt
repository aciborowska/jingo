I noticed this error the other day as one of our customers sent us a screen shot of the control panel : the changelog attribute which is an operational attribute that must points to the suffix contains the "change log"  is eligible for all entries throughout the server.

This is a bug. Only the rootDSE should contain the changelog attribute.
