Server should not process incoming request while a bind is processed.
To do so, DJ is disconnecting if such even occurs.

The leak appears because the result of the BIND request is processed after the disconnection. If the bind was successful, the connection is added to the list maintained in AuthenticatedUsers. But because this connection is already disconnected, this entry in the AuthenticatedUsers will never be removed.
