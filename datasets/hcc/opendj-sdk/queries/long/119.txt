Enabling a replication server when one of the other RS is down (in fact the only other RS) results in ERROR_UNEXPECTED.

Do the following steps in order.
Action DS1 RS2 RS3 DS4
setup   X   X
enable  X   X
Kstop       X
enable          X

On RS3:
dsreplication enable -n -X --host1 localhost --port1 1444 --bindDN1 cn=Directory Manager --bindPassword1 secret12 --noReplicationServer1 --host2 localhost --port2 3444 --BindDN2 cn=Directory Manager --bindPassword2 secret12 --replicationPort2 3989 --onlyReplicationServer2 --baseDN dc=europe,dc=com --adminUID admin --adminPassword admin

Establishing connections ..... Done.
The following errors were encountered reading the configuration of the
existing servers:
Error on localhost:2444: An error occurred connecting to the server.  Details:
javax.naming.CommunicationException: Connection timed out [Root exception is
java.net.ConnectException: Connection timed out]
The replication tool will to try to update the configuration of all the
servers in a best-effort mode.  However it cannot guarantee that the servers
that are generating errors will be updated.
Checking registration information ..... 
Error updating registration information.  Details: Registration information
