Found with OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev 3259fdc435a6ed8687e9572f7f05285caa47da2a

We setup a server and import an ldif file in which dns contain spaces, such as:
dn: uid=scarter, ou=People, dc=example,dc=com

Then we perform the following search:

./opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w password -T -b uid=scarter,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com  "(objectclass=*)"
dn: uid=scarter, ou=People, dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: person
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
...



The dn is returned as in the ldif file, with the spaces between the comma and the text, which is different from what we had before where whitespaces were stripped out.
