To reproduce, just need to run the following command:

/path/to/opendj/setup --acceptLicense --cli -p 1389 --adminConnectorPort 4444 -D cn=myself -w password -b dc=com -d 10 -n



Here is the error reported in the temporary setup log:
[30/10/2015:10:18:56 +0000] category=org.opends.quicksetup.util.ServerController seq=115 severity=INFO msg=server: [30/Oct/2015:10:18:56 +0000] category=CORE severity=NOTICE msgID=org.opends.messages.core.139 msg=The Directory Server has sent an alert notification generated by class org.opends.server.core.DirectoryServer (alert type org.opends.server.DirectoryServerShutdown, alert ID org.opends.messages.core-141): The Directory Server has started the shutdown process. The shutdown was initiated by an instance of class org.opends.server.core.DirectoryServer and the reason provided for the shutdown was An error occurred while trying to start the Directory Server: The administration connector self-signed certificate cannot be generated because the following error occurred: The following error occurred when generating a self-signed certificate using the alias admin-cert-ec: null

It seems that openjdk system libraries does not contains the elliptic curve certificates so server fails to generate keys and crashes.
To solve this issue, we should perform a test to know if elliptic curve provider is available on the running system.
If not, we have to decide wether we:

	Log a clean error and ask user to install elliptic curve provider librairies
	Continue without supporting this kind of certificate
