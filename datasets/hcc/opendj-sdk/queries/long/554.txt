LDAP searches cause the SNMP dsApplIfReadOps and dsApplIfSearchOps counters to be incremented. This is a bit too crude - searches should be subdivided into dsApplIfOneLevelSearchOps and dsApplIfWholeSubtreeSearchOps; I'm not sure if updating ReadOps ever makes sense for LDAP.

This matches what we report in our LDAP connection handler statistics.

But our network groups monitoring stats are richer:


bin/ldapsearch --port 4444 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w secret -b "cn=default,cn=Network Groups,cn=monitor" -X -Z "(objectclass=*)" | egrep 'dn|ds-mon.*total-count'
