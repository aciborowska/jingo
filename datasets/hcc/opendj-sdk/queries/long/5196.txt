Straight forward to reproduce:

1. Setup an opendj server with affected version 
2. Run backup, restore, import-ldif, export-ldif or rebuild-index with the --offline option and some connection options:

$ bin/rebuild-index --offline -h localhost -p 4444 --baseDn dc=example,dc=com -i uid
[18/06/2018:08:44:56 +0200] category=BACKEND seq=0 severity=FINE msg=JE backend 'userRoot' does not specify the number of cleaner threads: defaulting to 2 threads
[...]
[18/06/2018:08:44:57 +0200] category=BACKEND seq=39 severity=INFO msg=Rebuild complete. Processed 12 entries in 0 seconds (average rate 173.9/sec)



Observed behavior: Indexes are rebuilt offline and connection options are ignored.
Expected behavior: With the provided options on the command line, there is an ambiguity so the tool should ends with a client error and prints a user friendly message explaining the issue.
