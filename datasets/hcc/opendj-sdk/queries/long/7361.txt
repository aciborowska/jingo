I need to explain to users how to create base Docker images that are equivalent to the Docker images in gcr.io/forgeops-io, which are produced by the DS team. I assume that image does not have production mode enabled, because I don't see anything in the forgeops artifacts that resets the unauthenticated-requests-policy property.

(If I'm wrong about that, please let me know.)

I wrote up instructions to create a DS image  based on the samples/docker/README.md - see step 4 here: https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/build/site/forgeops/deployment-base-docker-images.html#cdg-customization-docker-deploy

However, I got an opinion from Mark Craig that an image created this way would have DS in production mode. 

If that's the case, then we either need to change setup.sh to put DS in non-production mode before creating the Docker image, or to change the doc to have users run steps to take DS out of production mode after running setup.sh and before creating the Docker image.

It would be easier for users not to have to run an additional command, and I think it would be better if setup.sh produced the same Docker image that's being put in gcr.io/forgeops-io. 

Please let me know how to proceed.
