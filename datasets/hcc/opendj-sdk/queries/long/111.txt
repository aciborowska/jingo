The current approach for deriving the value for a changeLogEntry's changeInitatorsName is somewhat "innovative".

The value for the attribute is parsed from the LDIF representation of the update message. However, the parsing is flawed because it uses the platform specific EOL character sequence to find the end of line, whereas LDIF is always generated using '\n' as a line separator. The implication is that this parsing phase will fail 100% of the time on Windows or Mac with an IndexOutOfBoundsException (the exception is caught and logged, but may go unnoticed).

The easy fix is to simply replace the usage of EOL with '\n'. However, this approach is not 100% bullet-proof since there is an underlying potential pathological bug that impacts all platforms (i.e. Unix included): if any attribute happens to contain the string "creatorsName" or "modifiersName" then this could potentially confuse the parsing algorithm.

The correct fix is not to parse the LDIF at all: the replication update messages contain all the required information in a much more accessible format.
