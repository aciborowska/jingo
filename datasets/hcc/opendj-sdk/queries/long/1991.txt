While trying to verify indexes against a pluggable backend from the control panel (Indexes -> Verify Indexes...), the verify failed with error code 1:

At least we should completely removed from the UI the deleted indexes 'id2children' and 'id2subtree', but even without these indexes, the verify fails.
