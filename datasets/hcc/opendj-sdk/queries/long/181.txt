After a replication server has started sometimes we are seeing the following message several times in the error logs.

[26/May/2011:14:26:43 +0200] 0 caught error thread=
{Replica replay thread 3(83)}
 threadDetail=
{parentThread=main(1) isDaemon=false }
 method=
{equals(AttributeValues.java:226)}
 caught=
{org.opends.server.types.DirectoryException: The provided value "cn=all-servers,cn=Server Groups,cn=admin data" has an invalid length for a UUID.  All UUID values must have a length of exactly 36 bytes, but the provided value had a length of 45 bytes}

Don't know what this means so raising issue to track this,
