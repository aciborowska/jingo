An anonymous search on monitoring endpoints returns a lot of detailed information, including JVM threads and database/backends details.

Monitoring endpoints requiring protection include:

	cn=monitor LDAP endpoint
	/metrics/api HTTP endpoint
	/metrics/prometheus HTTP endpoint



Interestingly, the only additional information that cn=directory manager gets is the server version and list of SSL ciphers, which may be interesting to publish in any case...

Either an ACI or a privilege should be put in place to limit the exposed data.
