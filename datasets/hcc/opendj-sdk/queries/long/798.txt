Servers A, B, C, D all replicate dc=example,dc=com

Requirement is for A & B to replicate dc=example,dc=org and for C & D to replicate a different dc=example,dc=org

Attempting to set that up using dsreplication results in all servers sharing the same dc=example,dc=org contents.

The documentation (9.2) suggests this configuration is possible:

The set of replicas sharing data in a given suffix is called a replication topology. You can have more than one replication topology. For example, one topology could be devoted to dc=example,dc=com, and another to dc=example,dc=org. Directory servers are capable of serving more than one suffix. They are also capable of participating in more than one replication topology.
