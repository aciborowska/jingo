Found using trunk (revision 10996).

I have a 2.6.0 replication topology with 2 servers (DS/RS) and I try to upgrade/migrate this topology to 2.7.0.
I upgrade the servers one after the other and after each upgrade I perform some operation (add, modify, modifyrdn and delete) on both servers to ensure that the replication is still working.

Scenario:
*********
1. install 2 servers (2.6.0) and enable replication
2. do add, modify, modifyrdn and delete operations on server1 and server2
=> works fine for all the operations
3. upgrade server1 to 2.7.0
4. do add, modify, modifyrdn and delete operations on server1 and server2
=> works fine for add and delete operations but not for modify and modifyrdn ones (the operations are not replayed on the other server)
5. upgrade server2 to 2.7.0
6. do add, modify, modifyrdn and delete operations on server1 and server2
=> works fine for all the operations
