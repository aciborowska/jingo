control-panel with -V/--version option reports an error (Argument -V is not allowed for use with this program) but this option is listed in the command-line usage.


$ ./opendj/bin/control-panel -V
An error occurred while parsing the command-line arguments:  An unexpected error occurred while attempting to initialize the command-line arguments:

...
General options:

-V, --version

The same problem appears with the following tools:

	backup
	control-panel
	create-rc-script
	dsjavaproperties
	encode-password
	export-ldif
	import-ldif
	ldapcompare
	ldapdelete
	ldapmodify
	ldappasswordmodify
	ldapsearch
	ldif-diff
	ldifmodify
	ldifsearch
	list-backends
	make-ldif
	manage-tasks
	rebuild-index
	restore
	stop-ds
	verify-index
	setup



For these tools the option -V/--version returns the help or nothing:

	base64 => help
	dbtest => nothing
	dsconfig => nothing
	dsreplication => nothing
	manage-account => nothing
	status => nothing



For these tools the option -V/--version is ignored:

	uninstall => uninstall is performed
	upgrade => upgrade is performed
