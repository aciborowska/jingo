At some point the server started logging over 1600 lines of the following:


[07/Aug/2013:20:03:01 -0700] category=SYNC severity=MILD_ERROR msgID=14876681 msg=Internal Error : Operation ModifyOperation(connID=-1, opID=195193, dn=code=5060,uid=75860,ou=people,dc=example,dc=edu) change number 000001405bdf892b24e100654708 was not found in pending list



All the logging was for different DNs with different change numbers.

The server then "completely stopped responding" (no stack traces are available); after restarting replication status showed the server was in sync.

It isn't clear if the errors are related to the server not responding, but they're unusual.
