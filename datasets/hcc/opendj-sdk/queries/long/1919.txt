I discovered following error message in Directory Server replication and error log file and also appeared in server.out during investigation on failing test on test branch:


[01/Apr/2015:23:02:03 +0100] category=SYNC severity=ERROR 
msgID=org.opends.messages.replication.145 
msg=Timed out while trying to acquire the domain lock for domain "dc=com". 
         The connection attempt from replication server RS(28097) at dj-robot-linux.*/* to this replication server RS(18218) will be aborted. 
         This is probably benign and a result of a simultaneous cross connection attempt



I can't identify the root cause, because the error appears in random replication tests during many runs.
