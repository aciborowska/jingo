Running setup to create 2 base DNs in a suffix sometimes results in a userRoot with a reported "1 entries" instead of 2. An analysis of the indexes reveals that in the "1 entries" case one of the DN2ID indexes is empty.

Running rebuild-index will correct the problem.

Attached is a script which will repeatedly run setup and exit when a failure is detected. Run it in an empty directory. It took 14 attempts to fail here.
