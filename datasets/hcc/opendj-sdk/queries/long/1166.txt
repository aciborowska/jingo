Currently we have three cases when the instance is not configured:
1. tools which are not expected to work but the error message should be updated to explain that the instance must be configured to use this tool:

	backup (on local instance, without -h ... -p ... options)
	control-panel
	dbtest
	dsjavaproperties
	export-ldif (on local instance, without -h ... -p ... options)
	import-ldif (on local instance, without -h ... -p ... options)
	list-backends
	rebuid-index (on local instance, without -h ... -p ... options)
	restore (on local instance, without -h ... -p ... options)
	status
	start-ds (see issue OPENDJ-1157)
	stop-ds (on local instance, without -h ... -p ... options)
	uninstall
	upgrade
	verify-index



2. tools which don't work but which should work (if they don't have dependency on config/schema):

	backup (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	control-panel (against a remote instance which is configured, with -r option see issue OPENDJ-1122)
	dsconfig (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	dsframework (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	dsreplication (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	encode-password
	export-ldif (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	import-ldif (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	ldifmodify
	ldifsearch
	make-ldif
	manage-tasks
	rebuild-index (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	restore (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)



3. tools which works:

	base64
	create-rc-script
	ldapcompare (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	ldapdelete (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	ldapmodify (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	ldappasswordmodify (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	ldapsearch (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	ldif-diff
	manage-account (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	stop-ds (against a remote instance which is configured, with -h ... -p ... options)
	windows-service



In case 1 and 2, the tools fails with the following message:


The version of the installed OpenDJ could not be determined because the
version file 'null/config/buildinfo' could not be found. Restore it from
backup before continuing


or


The version of the installed OpenDJ could not be determined because the
version file
'<instance_path>/opendj/config/buildinfo'
could not be found. Restore it from backup before continuing



==> this error message should be updated to explain that the instance must be configured to use the tool
