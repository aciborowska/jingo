Authenticated InternalClientConnections register themselves in the AuthenticatedUsers table but are never removed.

Internal client connections are only intended to be short-lived temporary objects and users of them do not expect to have to close/finalize them. Therefore we should not change the existing code to explicitly finalize internal connections, since this will only result in similar problems later when new code is added which again forgets to clean up internal connections.

Note also that we cannot rely on the GC to deregister the connection via a finalize() method, since the connection will never be GC'd because a reference is maintained to it from the authenticated users table.

The proposed fix is to not register internal client connections in the authenticated users table: these connections are transient objects which do not require referential integrity to be performed.
