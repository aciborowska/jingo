Steps to reproduce:

	modify the Dockerfile in opendj-ldapaas/common/docker/Dockerfile to install the ds-evaluation profile
	follow the instructions in the README.md to deploy a 3 way topology
	although the DS containers start there are many errors in the logs and the data cannot be accessed.



There are a number of problems that should be addressed:

	the ds-evaluation profile should not be encrypting data
	the ds-empty Docker image does not support encrypted data added during Docker build when the run-time master-key is different to the master-key used during the build
	the DS containers appear to have started but are unusable.



This bug will address the third item above. We could fix it by:


	refusing to start if an active symmetric key cannot be decrypted. The question is, how do we know which keys are active?
	refusing to start if an encrypted backend can be opened, but its entries cannot be decrypted. We could simply try reading the first entry in the DB.



We should also check whether the changelog performs any pre-flight checks as well.
