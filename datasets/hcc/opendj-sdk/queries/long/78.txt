In some cases (targetattr!=xxx) ACI clauses granting read access to attributes do not seem to work. They should grant access to all attributes not present in the clause.

We use this sort of ACI in the global ACI for allowing read access to non-sensitive attributes:

(targetattr!="userPassword||authPassword||changes||changeNumber||changeType||changeTime||targetDN||newRDN||newSuperior||deleteOldRDN||targetEntryUUID||targetUniqueID||changeInitiatorsName||changeLogCookie")(version 3.0; acl "Anonymous read access"; allow (read,search,compare) userdn="ldap:///anyone"
