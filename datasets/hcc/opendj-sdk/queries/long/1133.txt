After installing the OpenDJ RPM, there are two files under /usr/share/doc/opendj-2.7.0/ that are not present with Debian packaging, namely README_WINDOWS.txt and rfc2605.txt.



# ls /usr/share/doc/opendj-2.7.0/
CDDLv1_0.txt        OpenDS.LICENSE  README_WINDOWS.txt  THIRDPARTYREADME.txt
example-plugin.zip  README          rfc2605.txt



I don't think these files should be included in the package.
