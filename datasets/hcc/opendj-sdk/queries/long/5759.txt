When running supportExtract without passing the serverPID argument, the tool will consider the server is not running and hence won't collect monitoring data or JVM stack dump.
This bug has been introduced in 7.0.

How to reproduce:

./opendj/bin/supportextract -w password --outputDirectory . --bindDN "cn=Directory Manager"
......
No monitoring data can be collected when the server is not running or no
server interaction is allowed
No JVM stack dump can be produced when the server is not running  or no server
interaction is allowed
......
