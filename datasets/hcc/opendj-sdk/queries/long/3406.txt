Issue OPENDJ-3330 addressed the support of TLSv1.2 for client tools.
Support is now ok, but dsreplication status hangs during the connection timeout period when client uses TLSv1.2 and server uses TLSv1.1.
It is expected to fail, because there is a mismatch between the versions of TLS, but the error should be related to failing SSL handshake. Instead, it is failing with a connection timeout error:


Could not connect to localhost:4444. Check that the server is running and that
it is accessible from the local machine.  Details: Connect Error: The
connection attempt to server localhost/127.0.0.1:4444 has failed because the
connection timeout period of 30000 ms was exceeded


Not that the error is correctly reported when client uses TLSv1.1 and server uses TLSv1.2.
