Found using OpenDJ-3.0.0 (revision 12335).

Scenario:
************
1. install 2 servers (2.6.x version) and enable replication
2. check replication is working (add an entry, modify it, rename it (modrdn) and then delete it)
3. upgrade first server
4. check replication is working(add an entry, modify it, rename it (modrdn) and then delete it)
5. upgrade second server
6. check replication is working (add an entry, modify it, rename it (modrdn) and then delete it)

=> at this point the add operation is not replicated on the second server
=> no errors in the logs
