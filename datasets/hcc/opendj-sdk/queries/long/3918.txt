Per contract RequestFilter and RequestHandler are allowed to throws any Exception.

By allowing multiple RequestFilter to be chained, the RequestFilterChain must ensure that prior RequestFilter are notified whenever an Exception occurs in a filter executed after them.

Currently the Exception are not caught by the RequestFilterChain meaning that any exception occurring in the  RequestFilter or RequestHandler will be caught by the RequestFilterChain caller directly by skipping all the RequestFilter.
