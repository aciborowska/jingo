I discovered that dsconfig in interactive mode forces users to use --trustAll parameter.

See following scenario:

./bin/dsconfig
>>>> Specify OpenDJ LDAP connection parameters
Directory server hostname or IP address [mono]: 
Directory server administration port number [4444]: 
Administrator user bind DN [cn=Directory Manager]: 
Password for user 'cn=Directory Manager': 
Server Certificate:
User DN  : CN=pyforge.example.com, O=OpenDJ RSA Self-Signed Certificate
Validity : From 'Fri Jan 12 08:48:30 CET 2018'
             To 'Thu Jan 07 08:48:30 CET 2038'
Issuer   : CN=pyforge.example.com, O=OpenDJ RSA Self-Signed Certificate
Do you trust this server certificate?
  1) No
  2) Yes, for this session only
  3) Yes, also add it to a truststore
  4) View certificate details
Enter choice: [2]: 
Unable to connect to the server at mono on port 4444. In non-interactive mode,
if the trustStore related parameters are not used, you must use the
'--trustAll' option for remote connections


The server is running.
Moreover I tried to run status tool and when I tried to answer the question if I trust certificate it doesn't take my answer and prompted again. I did this few times and it exhausted my RAM on my laptop.
