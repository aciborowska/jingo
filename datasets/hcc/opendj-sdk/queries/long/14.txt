Hi Ludovic,

Unfortunately, there is another problem to report after the upgrade to the latest night build. I opened the directory with my LDAP browser, the root DSE was there, but the naming context that was supposed to be there doesn't show up. I checked the db files, they still appear to be in their original form (as far as I know the upgrade script doesn't touch them).

To make sure I'm reproducing the problem correctly I did a clean install of OpenDS 2.2.1, loaded the sample data with 2000 entries, and then ran an upgrade to OpenDJ 2.4.0-20101214. Again the entries disappeared. Note that the "namingContexts" in the root DSE is still shown correctly.


PS: Why is the vendorName in the root DSE still shown as "Sun Microsystems, Inc." ?
