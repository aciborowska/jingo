[03/May/2018:09:02:55 +0200] category=BACKEND severity=WARNING msgID=624 msg=Proxy backend 'proxyRoot' cannot register itself against base DN uid=Monitor because this base DN is already registered against backend 'monitorUser'
[03/May/2018:09:02:55 +0200] category=BACKEND severity=NOTICE msgID=621 msg=Proxy backend 'proxyRoot' automatically registered itself against the base DNs [o=example, uid=Monitor]. It was previously registered against the base DNs []



On the first log message, the proxy failed to register uid=Monitor but the second log actually declares uid=Monitor as being registered.

Problem seems to come from here where all newBaseDns are considered to be fully registered while some might not have been registered (as the log extract shows): https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/OPENDJ/repos/opendj/browse/opendj-server/src/main/java/org/opends/server/backends/ProxyBackend.java#578
