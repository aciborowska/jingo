500 Internal Server Error from null input param to Flowable#fromIterable when a resource does not have a reference for the reverse reference we are searching on.

 

An example is this query GET users?_queryFilter= manager/_id eq Jason&_fields=/reports. We want to get all the users who report to Jason, or put another way get all the users whos manager is Jason. It is possible that Jason has no reports, so when this search request searches for Jason and gets Jason's reports ldap reference attribute there will be no reference attributes since Jason has no reports.
