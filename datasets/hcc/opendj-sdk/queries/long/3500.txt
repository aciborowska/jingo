I started OpenDJ-4.0.0.SNAPSHOT (revision 48b4370dd38139a8e6c024c9a794b957d343d1dd)  and enabled publisher  "File-Based Access Logger".

I configured new access log filtering criteria with this publisher and I set following properties:

--set connection-port-equal-to:1389 --set log-record-type:CONNECT



After that I have purged access log and run an ldapsearch

ldapsearch -h pyforge.example.com -p 1389 -D cn=myself -w password  -b "ou=Legacy,dc=com"  "uid=user.0" 



After this command I checked the access log and there was no message.

To quickly reproduce the issue, use attached script.

NOTE: We are hitting same issue also with csv and JSON log publishers and only with 4.0.0.
