The dsrepl tool may not be finished for initialize from non-exists/not-at-topology server.

Steps to reproduce:

	Set up  two instances at replication topology (DJ1 and DJ2) (could be used https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/QA/repos/pyforge/browse/PyBot/OpenDJ/testcases/functional/replication_group1/DsRepl.py for set up) and start instances
	Reproduce only with run dsrepl initialize from non existing/not at topology server (randomly on my notebook)
	
		First time call dsrepl initialize from non-existing server

./dsrepl initialize --fromServer dj-none -h localhost -p 4444 -D "uid=admin" -w "password" -X --baseDn dc=com

Starting initialization from 'dj-none' to 'dj1' for base DNs: 'dc=com'
Starting initialization for base DN: 'dc=com'
An error occurred during initialization. Last log details:
[16/Jun/2020:09:54:38 +0200] severity="ERROR" msgCount=1 msgID=null--1
message="Other: "RS(dj1, 8989) for domain dc=com cannot route message of type
InitializeRequestMsg to replica dj-none because it is unreachable. Reachable
replicas: [dj1, dj2]"; [16/Jun/2020:09:54:38 +0200] severity="NOTICE"
msgCount=2 msgID=org.opends.messages.backend-414 message="Initialize From
Replica task dsrepl-initialize-1 finished execution in the state Stopped by
error". Task state: STOPPED_BY_ERROR
Check the server error logs for additional details

		Second and next times call dsrepl initialize from non-existing server - it can has same response as above (if yes try again) or tool freeze and show only:

 ./dsrepl initialize --fromServer dj-none -h localhost -p 4444 -D "uid=admin" -w "password" -X --baseDn dc=com
Starting initialization from 'dj-none' to 'dj1' for base DNs: 'dc=com'
Starting initialization for base DN: 'dc=com'

	Reproduce when any initialize and initialize from non-exists server is preformed at the same time
	
		Call dsrepl initialize (toAllServers, toServer or fromServer)

./dsrepl initialize --fromServer dj2 -h localhost -p 4444 -D "uid=admin" -w "password" -X --baseDn dc=com
Starting initialization from 'dj2' to 'dj1' for base DNs: 'dc=com'
Starting initialization for base DN: 'dc=com'
145 entries processed (87 % complete).


		Before above initialize finished start initialize from non-exists server

./dsrepl initialize --fromServer dj-none -h localhost -p 4444 -D "uid=admin" -w "password" -X --baseDn dc=com
Starting initialization from 'dj-none' to 'dj1' for base DNs: 'dc=com'
Starting initialization for base DN: 'dc=com'
An error occurred during initialization. Last log details:
[16/Jun/2020:10:43:51 +0200] severity="NOTICE" msgCount=0
msgID=org.opends.messages.backend-413 message="Initialize From Replica task

Check the server error logs for additional details

		Wait for finished first initialize

Starting initialization from 'dj2' to 'dj1' for base DNs: 'dc=com'
Starting initialization for base DN: 'dc=com'
145 entries processed (87 % complete).
164 entries processed (99 % complete).
Done

		Run again dsrepl initialize from non-exists server (it every times freeze on my machine)

./dsrepl initialize --fromServer dj-none -h localhost -p 4444 -D "uid=admin" -w "password" -X --baseDn dc=com
Starting initialization from 'dj-none' to 'dj1' for base DNs: 'dc=com'
Starting initialization for base DN: 'dc=com'

Actual result:
Dsrepl initialize is able to freeze at case initialize from non-existing server. I was run it over night and it was not finished.

Expected result:
Dsrepl initialize should not run that long without response/results. It should return every times that it is unreachable or import/export already in progress.
