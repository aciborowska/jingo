This issue is related to OPENDJ-5381. In this one, we had 2 API endpoints deployed with the same json definition example-v1.json except one of this two had a slightly different schema description for "frapi:opendj:rest2ldap:user:1.0".

It seems to work well for the embedded http connector of DJ (enpoints are partitioned): you can have two API endpoints having different definitions for the same schema (for instance for "frapi:opendj:rest2ldap:user:1.0").

But not for the Rest2Ldap gateway: you can't have two API endpoints having different definitions for the same schema (for instance for "frapi:opendj:rest2ldap:user:1.0"). We've got a stacktrace java.lang.IllegalStateException: The given Schema name 'frapi:opendj:rest2ldap:user:1.0' already exists but the Schema objects are not equal.
That's due to the fact the servlet doesn't partition the endpoints.

NOTE: if ever a customer had an issue with that, one workaround would to deploy the endpoints within different servlet containers (1 Tomcat or Jetty per endpoint).
