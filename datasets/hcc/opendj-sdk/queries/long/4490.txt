When used with the -n, --no-prompt option, dsconfig and manage-tasks are prompting the user for the bind password if it has not been provided in command line parameters or in property file:

noformat
$ /path/to/opendj/bin/manage-tasks -p 4444 -D cn=directory\ manager -X --no-prompt
Password for user 'cn=directory manager': 
noformat
Even if the command has no chances to succeeded, tools used with the -n, --no-prompt option should never perform interactive actions since such option is meant to be used in scripts.

The exepected behavior for such command is the one we had with versions 5.5.0 or lower:

$ /path/to/opendj/bin/dsconfig -p 4444 -D cn=directory\ manager -X --no-prompt
The LDAP bind password was not specified and cannot be read interactively
