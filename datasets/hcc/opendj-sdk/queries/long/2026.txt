Navigating to:

http://docs.forgerock.org/en/opendj/2.6.0/configref/index.html

Then -> QOS Policy -> Network Group leads to:

http://docs.forgerock.org/en/opendj/2.6.0/configref/network-group.html

Which is a 404.

But actually it seems that this was intentionally hidden as per OPENDJ-337 and the related QOS Policy functionality should also be given the same treatment until equivalent functionality is added in the future.
