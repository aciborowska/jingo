When doing some actions from UIs, we have the oppurtunity to display equivalent command lines. The following image show an example for a standard setup:

unfortunately, if we copy/paste suggested command line in a shell, the command fails because there is some incorrect blank space characters.

In addition, an improvement could be to comment all lines which are not part of command lines. (e.g "Equivalent non-interactive command to setup the server:" should be "# Equivalent non-interactive command to setup the server:" or "rem Equivalent non-interactive command to setup the server:" for windows)
