ConfigurationBackend, SchemaBackend, TruststoreBackend and TaskBackend do not stop modification requests from happening during backup.
 org.opends.server.api.LocalBackend#createBackup implementation of each of these backends do not use any locking mechanism to prevent modification requests from happening during a backup.

This is dangerous because the resulting backup can be corrupted.

This issue can be closed once the backends mentioned above support "atomic" backup.
