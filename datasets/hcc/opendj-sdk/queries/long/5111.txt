We spotted an issue, when running functional tests, with authrate tool.

In the test we run a simple authrate command:


./authrate -h dj-robot-linux.internal.forgerock.com -p 1389 -D "{2}" -w password -d 10 -b ou=people,dc=com -S -f -c 10 -i 1 -g "rand(0,99)" "(uid=user.{1})"

which is documented here: https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/6/reference/#authrate-1

It returns following error, but it used to work before:


The provided value "{2}" could not be parsed as a valid distinguished name
because character '{' at position 0 is not allowed in an attribute name
