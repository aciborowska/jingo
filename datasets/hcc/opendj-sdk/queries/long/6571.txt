Step to reproduce:

Run the setup tool to setup a proxy server by running the ds-proxy-server profile interactively, first specify to forward only requests targeting some specific base DNs:

You will be prompted for the LDAP request forwarding configuration. 
You can configure the proxy to forward only requests with target DNs under
specific base DNs.
If you choose not to do so then requests will be forwarded to all public
naming contexts of the remote servers.
Do you want to specify target DNs (yes / no) [yes]: 
Base DN: dc=test,dc=com

Add another base DN (yes / no) [yes]: 
Base DN: dc=example,dc=com

Add another base DN (yes / no) [yes]: n


Few steps after, the profile parameters are summarized and you realized that you made a mistake and ask to be prompted again:

Directory Server Customization Parameters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[...]
Configure server for profile 'DS proxy server'                       
Replication server                                                   opendj.example.com:5444
Replication server                                                   opendj.example.org:6444
Securing connections to remote servers                               ssl
[...]
Accept these choices and continue? (yes / no) [yes]: n


This time, you decide to simply forward all requests to all public
 naming contexts of the remote servers:

[...]
Do you want to specify target DNs (yes / no) [no]: 

Directory Server Customization Parameters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configure server for profile 'DS proxy server'                       
[...]
Replication domain group ID (empty implies all servers are primary)  12
Forward requests under           

Accept these choices and continue? (yes / no) [yes]: 


Although the Forward requests under is quite suspicious and is also a bug in UI, no base DNs are printed on the summary screen nor in the equivalent command line so you might think that it is ok apart from the UI.
 More problematic than the UI issue, after setup, the proxy backend is actually configured as follow:

>>>> Configure the properties of the Backend "proxyRoot"

         Property                           Value(s)
         ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    1)   backend-id                         proxyRoot
    2)   base-dn                            "dc=example,dc=com",
                                            "dc=test,dc=com"
    3)   bind-connection-pool-idle-timeout  10 s
    4)   bind-connection-pool-max-size      1024


Whereas expected configuration would be:

>>>> Configure the properties of the Backend "proxyRoot"

         Property                           Value(s)
         ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    1)   backend-id                         proxyRoot
    2)   base-dn                            Unless route-all is enabled, a
                                            proxy with empty base DNs does not
                                            handle any requests. This helps
                                            incrementally building a proxy's
                                            configuration.
    3)   bind-connection-pool-idle-timeout  10 s


Acceptance criteria

This bug can be close when the actual UI problem noticed above which is a smell of the issue will be fixed and when the proxy backend configuration will match user choices made during setup.
