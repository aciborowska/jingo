I have big problem in my company with opendj. The problem is solved now but we need to find out what was the cause.
We have 4 nodes on CentOS with OpenDJ and OpenSSO.
OpenDJ-2.6.0.
java version “1.6.0_45”

What was the problem:
1.
On every Node we had very high disk consumption by opendj proces (from iotop):


sso 3555 1 76 20:28 ? 02:00:14 /../java -server -Dorg.opends.server.scriptName=start-ds org.opends.server.core.DirectoryServer –configClass org.opends.server.extensions.ConfigFileHandler –configFile /../config.ldif



iostat -x give us 90 – 99 %util
This was mainly READ operations.

2.
Database ../db/userRoot/ in opendj grow 3 times bigger. Normally it have 8G but during breakdown 20G – 30G

3. We tried to get information about the state of the index. But it lasted for hours.

4. We`ve tried to change memory parameters:
-d64 -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=1 -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -Xloggc:/…/logs/gc.log -XX:-PrintGC -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -XX:+PrintHeapAtGC -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution -XX:PrintFLSStatistics=1


sso 3555 1 76 20:28 ? 02:00:14 /../java -server -d64 -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=1 -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -Xloggc:/…/logs/gc.log -XX:-PrintGC -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -XX:+PrintHeapAtGC -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution -XX:PrintFLSStatistics=1 -Dorg.opends.server.scriptName=start-ds org.opends.server.core.DirectoryServer –configClass org.opends.server.extensions.ConfigFileHandler –configFile /../config.ldif



But it didn't change anything.

5.
We did an export of ldif, it has only 6,5G!
Build new config and import it. Next after replication on rest of the Nodes, everything works for now.

We also have many of this, in ldif export:


ds-sync-hist: accountno:00000152f87b94e13700344d08:add:9191762
ds-sync-hist: modifytimestamp:000001ef87b94e13703494d08:repl:20160217135955Z
ds-sync-hist: modifiersname:00000152ef874e13700394d08:repl:cn=D,cn=Root DNs,cn=config



I ask for help in determining the cause. Does someone have similar symptoms? Any Idea what could make OpenDJ grown like that? How can I check whats wrong, how to secure from it?

Can I force opendj to for weight loss?

There is also topic with that problem: https://forgerock.org/topic/opendj-high-disk-consumption-io/#post-8779
But it didn't help me solve the problem.
