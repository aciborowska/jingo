The proxy logs the following message:

' do not allow connections for replication server group 'Replication Service Discovery Mechanism'



This message presents three problems that all need to be fixed:

	The warning message is not precise enough when describing the current problem. The admin is left wondetring how to fix this.
	It should not be doing multiline logging
	At the end of the message, 'Replication Service Discovery Mechanism' really is the name of the replication service discovery mechanism, but the message falsely leads us to believe this is the name of the replication server group.



This warning message is logged by ReplicationServiceDiscoveryMechanism.buildReplica().

Acceptance criteria

This issue can be closed once all 3 problems listed above have been resolved.
