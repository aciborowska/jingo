The fr-idm-managed-user-explicit objectClass has been defined as a subclass of inetOrgPerson.

That implies that it cannot be used with any other objectClass that also subclass inetOrgPerson. Most of our customers are typically subclassing inetOrgPerson, when defining the schema for their users. So in effect fr-idm-managed-user-explicit is incompatible with our customers' data and schema.

A solution (and the best practice) is to define fr-idm-managed-user-explicit as an Auxiliary objectClass, so it can be added to any person entry (or even to non person entries).

Also, the objectclass fr-idm-managed-user-explicit contains in its list of allowed attributes 3 attributes that are coming from the Password Policy schema (pwdCheckQuality, pwdMinLength, pwdExpireWarning) and that have very specific meanings and effects on the behavior of the server. When used in the fr-idm-managed-user-explicit, the server will do no processing with them. This may create confusion to the administrators, that could expect the attributes to drive the same behavior regardless of how they are used.

I will strongly suggest to change these attributes to ones that only have a meaning for IDM.
