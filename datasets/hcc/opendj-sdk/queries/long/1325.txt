I will upgrade from Opendj-2.5.0 Express1 to Opendj-2.6.0. I download the last version of Opendj-2.6.0 on 30 January 2014.

After stop opendj instance I make a copy from the directory OOpenDJ-2.5.0-Xpress1 to copy OpenDJ-2.6.0. Make a symbolic Link "opendj" from OpenDJ-2.6.0. Start ./opendj/upgrade and "OpenDJ was successfully upgraded from version 2.5.0.8087 to 2.6.0.9086"
By the next action "rebuild index" I become follow error:

Before I start the rebuild-index the file was avail. But now it's not avail. I check the directory ./db/userRoot and a second file is also missing. I can not find a log file where perhaps more information could be of this error.
