Found with OpenDJ 4.1.0 rev (4234594f03b)

Return code for ldapsearch in case of wrong combination of parameters for ssl  has changed again.
When using a server configured to have ssl enabled with blind trust manager, if we use the ldap port and the trustall options together, we use to have an 81 return code before 4.0.0.
Then we had 82 in 4.0.0.
Now in 4.1.0, we have 81 again:


\DJ1\opendj\bat\ldapsearch.bat -h dj-robot-windows2 -p 1389   -b "dc=com" -X -Z "uid=user.340" postalCode 	
03:54:01.673 	WARN 	ERROR:
-- rc --
returned 81, expected 82
-- stdout --
# The LDAP search request failed: 81 (Server Connection Closed)



Is it expected to have rc=81 again here?
