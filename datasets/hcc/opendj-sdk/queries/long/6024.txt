Steps to reproduce:

	Setup a server with the root user "uid=admin":


$ ./setup --serverId                docker \
          --hostname                localhost \
          --adminConnectorPort      4444 \
          --ldapPort                1389 \
          --enableStartTls \
          --ldapsPort               1636 \
          --httpPort                8080 \
          --httpsPort               8443 \
          --rootUserDn              uid=admin \
          --rootUserPassword        password \
          --monitorUserDn           uid=monitor \
          --monitorUserPassword     password






	Perform an LDAP search as uid=admin:


$ ./bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D uid=admin -w password -b "cn=monitor" -s base "(objectclass=*)" ds-mon-server-id
The LDAP bind request failed: 49 (Invalid Credentials)





Diagnosis:

Error log indicates that the user was not found. Inspection of the root user LDIF shows that the entry violates the server's schema because it does not contain a "cn" attribute.

There are two problems here:

	the root user entry should conform to the schema
	the LDIF backend initialization is silently failing. It is performing schema validation and silently rejecting invalid entries. Firstly, it should not perform schema validation and secondly it should not silently reject entries.
