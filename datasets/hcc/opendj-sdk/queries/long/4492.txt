During manual tests on 3.5.3, we noticed a problem with establishing a replication topology using setup gui.

Steps to reproduce:

	Setup first server via GUI and let the instance be a part of topology
	Try to setup second instance
	At topology page:
	
		Fill all fields about first server
		click Next - at this point a pop up window appears with error message Invalid Credentials
	
	



The expected behavior is obviously a working replication topology.

In logs:
