Issues OPENDJ-427 and OPENDJ-673 could cause application threads to hang. It would be better if we "completed" pending futures when errors like this occur. It should still be pretty easy to diagnose the problem since the exception will be logged and the ErrorResultException will also contain the internal error as its cause.
