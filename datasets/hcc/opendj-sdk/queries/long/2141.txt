Found by Christophe's functional tests.
This is a regression, it used to work.

Scenario


	Several modifications are performed on two combined DS/RS
	Search is performed on cn=changelog with a filter on changeNumber >= x, retrieving changelogCookie attributes for 3 entries with values cookie, cookie2 and cookie3
	Another search is performed on cn=changelog with a filter on changelogCookie = (|(cookie1)(cookie2)(cookie3))



Actual result
No entries are returned.

Expected result
The same 3 entries returned by the search with the changeNumber filter should be returned.
