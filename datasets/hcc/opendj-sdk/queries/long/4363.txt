In dsml and rest2ldap, under WEB-INF/lib, jars have their version in their name such as:

activation-1.1.jar                       
forgerock-util-22.0.0-RC2.jar            
json-resource-22.0.0-RC2.jar
api-descriptor-22.0.0-RC2.jar
...



whereas in dj, the version is not visible:

forgerock-util.jar
json-resource.jar



This would be better to have consistent names.
