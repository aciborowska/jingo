Performance is significantly worse for rest read operations with OpenDJ version 7.0.0 than with version 6.5.* It happens with default and changed password storage schema. Difference is between 6-13% on my locale machine.

This problem could be reproduce with the suite "Perf Comparison.RestOperationsComparison".

./run-pybot.py -c perf -v -s perf_comparison.RestOperationsComparison* OpenDJ

I know that default password storage schema at version 7.0.0 was changed. But when used same password storage schema for both version, I expected that average throughput should be similar.

Result for one of runs on my localehost:
  
 opendj_rest2ldap_ReadUserAsAdmin_20200206-124352.out  opendj_rest2ldap_ReadUserAsAdmin_20200206-123225.out  opendj_rest2ldap_ReadUserAsAdmin_20200206-122045.out 

Range of average throughput on my machine:

	4200 ~ 4700 for NEW_DJ (default)
	4400 ~ 4800 for NEW_DJ2 (change)
	4700 ~ 5100 for OLD_DJ (default)
