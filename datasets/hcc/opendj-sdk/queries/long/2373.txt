The property user-is-not-member-of does not work in the right order.

For example:

Provide basic ldapsearch command using credentials of user.0 which IS member of group cn=Admins,dc=example,dc=com
In log appears the right message.

Provide basic ldapsearch command using credentials of user.1 which IS NOT member of group cn=Admins,dc=example,dc=com
In log appears the right message.

Set filtering criteria for user-is-member-of as below:
dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D 'cn=Directory Manager' --no-prompt -w password set-log-publisher-prop --publisher-name "File-Based Access Logger" --set filtering-policy:inclusive
dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D 'cn=Directory Manager' --no-prompt -w password set-access-log-filtering-criteria-prop --publisher-name "File-Based Access Logger" --criteria-name "Log messages which are not provided by users of group Admins" --set user-is-not-member-of:cn=Admins,dc=example,dc=com

Provide basic ldapsearch command using credentials of user.0 which IS member of group cn=Admins,dc=example,dc=com
In log does not appear message. -> OK

Provide basic ldapsearch command using credentials of user.1 which IS NOT member of group cn=Admins,dc=example,dc=com
In log does not appear message. -> BUG
