The last couple of days, the doc tests have failed in a dsreplication configure command that worked previously.

The error context is the following:
Initializing registration information on server localhost:14444 with the
 contents of server localhost:4444 .....
 Error launching initialization with contents from server localhost:4444.
 Details: Invalid DN Syntax: Invalid DN provided with the Initialize taskOther:
 No domain matches the provided base DN 'cn=admin data'
 See /tmp/opendj-replication-18163894785271468070.log for a detailed log of
 this operation.
(/tmp/opendj-replication-18163894785271468070.log is an empty file, by the way.)

To reproduce the problem, try the attached script, setup-dsrs-and-ds.bash.
