Steps to reproduce:


	download OpenDJ 4.0.0
	unzip it
	read the README in order to find out what to do next.



Unfortunately the README is quite misleading for a couple of reasons:


	it claims that OpenDJ is an open source project under the CDDL license which is not the case:

OpenDJ - Open Source Directory Services in Java

This archive contains OpenDJ, an open source, high performance, highly
available, secure, directory server in Java.

This product includes software available under the Common Development and
Distribution License (CDDL).  The complete text for this license, and for
alternate licenses of included components, may be found in the legal-notices
directory.


	the instructions for using the "setup" tool are out of date. They refer to the GUI mode and the CLI mode. In particular, the CLI instructions don't work:


$ ./setup --cli
An error occurred while parsing the command-line arguments:  Argument --cli is
not allowed for use with this program

See "setup --help" to get more usage help
