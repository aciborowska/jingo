When using the UpgradeCli class to upgrade older versions of OpenDJ which are acting as OpenAM's embeddedDS, HTTP Connection handler is added to the config.  This breaks Tomcat6 since it relies on the javax.server-api.jar.  There should be an option to leave this out of the config if OpenDJ is acting as an embeddedDS inside Tomcat.
