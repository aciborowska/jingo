When trying to start OpenAM's embedded OpenDJ, after upgrading it with the UpgradeCli class, a warning is thrown:  org.opends.server.types.InitializationException: The Directory Server could not acquire an exclusive lock on file <openam install directory>/opends/./locks/server.lock:  The attempt to obtain an exclusive lock on file <openam install directory>/opends/./locks/server.lock was rejected because an exclusive lock was already held on that file.  This generally means that another instance of this server is already running

During the upgrade process the method org.opends.server.tools.upgrade.Upgrade.checkIfServerIsRunning gets an exclusive lock, but this lock is never released before the upgrade process ends.
