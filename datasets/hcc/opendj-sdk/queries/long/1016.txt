When using the control panel to create a static group, it will create a group using the groupOfUniqueNames objectclass and with uniqueMember attributes.
According to the docs:

When creating a group entry, use groupOfNames or groupOfEntries where possible.


Also this part of the doc is quite vague on why using groupOfUniqueNames is not recommended.
