Reported on 3.0.0, reproducible on 5.5.0.

DS checks disk space using java.io.File.getUsableSpace (as expected), but logs java.io.File.getFreeSpace.

 

E.g. with disk-low-threshold set to 680 GB (for test purposes)

	When getUsableSpace dropped below 680 GB, this was logged:





[24/Nov/2017:14:00:47 +0800] category=CORE severity=NOTICE msgID=org.opends.messages.core.139 msg=The Directory Server has sent an alert notification generated by class org.opends.server.extensions.DiskSpaceMonitor (alert type org.opends.server.DiskSpaceLow, alert ID org.opends.messages.core-749): The disk containing directory /home used by userRoot backend is low on free space (729832792064 bytes free). Write operations are only permitted by a user with the BYPASS_LOCKDOWN privilege until the free space rises above the threshold. Replication updates are still allowed

 

	The getUsableSpace() and getFreeSpace() of /home at the time was:
