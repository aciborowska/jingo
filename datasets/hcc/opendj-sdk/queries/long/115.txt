There are many cases like this in the replication code: 500ms is way too small and is a likely cause of some of our intermittent unit test failures (think GC pauses). We should consider a) longer timeouts and/or b) polling servers concurrently using executors. In the latter case the total time taken e.g. to monitor N servers will be max(S1, S2, ..., Sn) instead of S1+S2+...+Sn.

In addition, the timeouts may impact tools like dsreplication.
