I noticed that if I create plugin and put it into ./lib/extensions, such jar is not visible then in the classpath. So I am getting errors like this:

"IOException parsing XML document from class path resource [application-context.xml]; nested exception is java.io.FileNotFoundException: class path resource [application-context.xml] cannot be opened because it does not exist."
and my plugin doesn't load on startup.

In Windows environment I can set the CLASSPATH variable (with /lib/extensions/*) before I start start-ds.bat script and it works fine.
The problem exists on Solaris, because my existing CLASSPATH variable is overwritten in /lib/_script-util.sh:
set_classpath() {
  CLASSPATH="${INSTANCE_ROOT}/classes" 
...
}

I'd recommend to either add jar files from extensions to the classpath in set_classpath() method or include existing CLASSPATH value into new CLASSPATH.

Thanks,
Greg
