The changes from OPENDJ-625 allow any user (even anonymous) to change an RDN as long as it matches the old value. For example:

dn: uid=user.9,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: moddn
newrdn: uid=USER.9
deleteoldrdn: 1



To fix this issue, a minimal change to AciHandler.java is required. I will immediately provide a patch for it.
