In SDK, a schema definition with a NAME field containing one or more spaces is rejected.
For example, this definition:


"( 2.5.6.4 NAME 'full rule' DESC 'ommit parenthesis' "
                  + " OBSOLETE"
                  + " AUX posixAccount "
                  + " MUST cn "
                  + " MAY dc "
                  + " NOT x121Address )"


is rejected because "full rule" contains a space.

According to RFC 4512, space characters are allowed in the NAME field.
This server implementation handle it correctly.
