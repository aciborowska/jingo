Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev 606ce749ba6

Scenario
1. setup a server with "dc=com" suffix
2. create a new backend "myBackend" with suffix "dc=batchmode,dc=com"
3. import data in this new backend
=> import succeeds but we get the following error in the errors log:

[26/Feb/2017:22:37:08 +0100] category=CORE severity=ERROR msgID=578 msg=Base DN dc=batchmode,dc=com has been deregistered from the Directory Server for backend myBackend. This base DN had both superior and subordinate entries in other backends, and there might be inconsistent or unexpected behavior when accessing entries in this portion of the hierarchy because of the missing entries that had been held in the de-registered backend
