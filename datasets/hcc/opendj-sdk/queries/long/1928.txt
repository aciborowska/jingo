During investigation of OpenDJ's 3.0.0 failed tests I discovered that sometimes when cn=schema is edited by changing 99-user.ldif the change is not replicated to other instances of opendj in same topology.

Base points are:

	Setup two instances of opendj 3
	Enable replication
	Stop all servers
	Modify 99-user.ldif file using ldifmodify tool to add new objectclass or attribute on instance 1
	Start all servers
	Try to add new entry on instance 2 -> this step fail



I have attached commands to reproduce the issue.
