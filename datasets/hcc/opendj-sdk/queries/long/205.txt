Currently there are just NYI stubs.

It should be possible to pass in a call-back for processing rejected and skipped records. It would be really nice if these call-backs were passed a list containing all the warnings/errors associated with a record, rather than just the first.

Also need to check whether the schema validation support is complete. It looks like it only does attribute syntax/constraint validation, but not object class (i.e. entry level) validation.
