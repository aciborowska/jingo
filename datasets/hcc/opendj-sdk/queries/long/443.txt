The dsconfig tool only returns error code 0 on success, and 1 on failure.

This range of error code returns are limited, we should consider distinguishing between different types of error.

For example.
0) success
1) unable to connect / connection failure
2) authn/authz failure
3) client side errors
4) other failure.
