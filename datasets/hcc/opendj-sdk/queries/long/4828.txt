Rounding is ok for equality indexing because indexes are probablistic and may return false positives. However ordering indexes are always expected to correctly order their keys. At the moment the number normalization is rounding numbers to 6 decimal places. This is sufficient for equality matching, but may result in the wrong ordering for very small numbers.

Suggested fix:


	Normalize numbers using a mechanism similar to the existing IntegerOrderingMatchingRuleImpl. Specifically:




	sign bit: 1 = positive, 0 = negative
	the rest is left as an exercise for the reader 



Basically, I think we need to normalize the number so that we end up with a mantissa which is between 0 and 1 and an exponent. Then encode the sign, exponent, and mantissa.
