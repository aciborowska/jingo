In order to fix OPENDJ-6543, I had a look at the dsreplication unconfigure --unconfigureReplicationServer command. The online help makes it sound like this unconfigures the RS, leaving the DS replicating with other servers:

-a, --unconfigureReplicationServer
    Unconfigure the replication server.  The replication port and change log
    will be unconfigured on the specified server 

That is not what I see when trying the command on a build from the master branch today. Instead, it seems to stop replication completely for the target server.

To reproduce:

	Install two servers and get them replicating as DS/RS of each other. (I used setup2dsrs.sh.)
	Run the command against the first server.
	Modify a user's description on the first server, and then read the result on the second server: no change.
	Modify a user's description on the second server, and then read the result on the first server: no change.
	Try dsreplication status on both servers: only the second server shows a result.
	Compare the config.ldif files: On the first server, the cn=Multimaster Synchronization,cn=Synchronization Providers,cn=config entry still looks good, but there are no longer any entries under cn=domains,cn=Multimaster Synchronization,cn=Synchronization Providers,cn=config.
