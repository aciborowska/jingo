2.6.4 of the SDK was built against server 2.7.0-SNAPSHOT which contains some minor API changes to InternalClientConnection. These changes mean that 2.6.4 of the SDK is not binary compatible, with 2.6.0 of the server.

A simple fix would be to restrict the dependency resolution of the SDK adapter to 2.4-2.6 and force it to build against 2.6 of the server.
