Over the last week, doc tests have been updated for changes to the expected value of Additional Information:

	A few messages are now prefixed with the human-readable translation of the LDAP error code.
	A couple of messages now have what seem to be spurious brackets ([ ]) around a nested message.



It would be nice to align additional information messages to follow the same pattern throughout, as was the case at least for all messages that showed up in the 5.5 docs.
