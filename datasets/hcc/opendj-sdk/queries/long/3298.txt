I was trying to demonstrate the use of log filtering and created a new access log filtering criteria, in interactive mode with the --displayCommand option.

Interactively, I created a new criteria with the following parameters :
log-record-type: search
search-response-is-indexed: false
response-etime-greater-than: 5000

But the displayed command only contains the first option set, never all of them as illustrated below :
dsconfig create-access-log-filtering-criteria \
          --publisher-name File-Based\ Access\ Logger \
          --set log-record-type:search \
          --type generic \
          --criteria-name Costly\ Search \
          --no-prompt

The config is correctly created, but the equivalent command misses all but one parameters.
I've verified this issue with different configuration elements.
