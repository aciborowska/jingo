Found using OpenDJ 5.5.0 RC2

When unzipping the Password Sync Plugin archives the licenses files are not in the correct folder.


$ ls legal-notices/opendj-openidm-account-change-notification-handler/
CDDLv1_0.txt               Forgerock_License.txt      copyrights.txt             third-party-copyrights.txt third-party-licenses



=> the licenses files should be under legal-notices folder
