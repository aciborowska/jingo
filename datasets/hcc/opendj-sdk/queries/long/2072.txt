In the new reference http://opendj.forgerock.org/opendj-server-legacy/doc/bootstrap/reference/index.html, references are numbered with Roman numerals, and appendices with letters.

Unfortunately the last appendix is numbered I., which comes just before the last reference which is numbered III.

Even though I wrote the thing, I was scratching my head for a while before I realized that II.'s not missing.
