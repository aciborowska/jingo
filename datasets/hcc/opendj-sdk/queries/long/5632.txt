Found with rev  	OpenDJ 6.5.0-SNAPSHOT (00fd47957e5)

In our replication test suites, we have a test that performs a binary copy.
In order to do so, it uses the dsreplication pre-external-initialization command to then import a ldif on one DJ, back it up, and restore this back up on second DJ then runs dsreplication.bat post-external-initialization.

During the pre-external-initialization step, we got an error in the log:


DJ1\opendj\bat\dsreplication.bat pre-external-initialization -h dj-win2008r2.internal.forgerock.com -p 4445 -b dc=com -I admin -w password  -X -n 	
05:47:27.471 	INFO 	SUCCESS:
-- rc --
returned 0, effectively in [0]
-- stdout --

Preparing base DN dc=com to be initialized externally ..... Done

Now you can proceed to the initialization of the contents of the base DNs on
all the replicated servers.  You can use the command import-ldif or the binary
copy to do so.  You must use the same LDIF file or binary copy on each server.

When the initialization is completed you must use the subcommand
'post-external-initialization' for replication to work with the new base DNs
contents.

This is a regression.
