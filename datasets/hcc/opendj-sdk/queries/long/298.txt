I've just tried to install OpenDJ using the JNLP installer and IF I selected the "This server will be part of a replication topology" option, then the Review screen shows the Runtime Options panel again, instead of showing the Review panel. If you choose the standalone server option magically the Review panel will show up correctly.

(BTW which component is this in JIRA?  )
