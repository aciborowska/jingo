When editing a configuration object such as a backend:


[...]
>>>> Select the Backend from the following list:

    1)  adminRoot
    2)  userRoot

    a)  show advanced components and properties
    q)  quit
    c)  cancel

Enter choice [c]: 2


>>>> Configure the properties of the userRoot

         Property                 Value(s)
         ---------------------------------------------
    1)   backend-id               userRoot
    2)   base-dn                  "dc=example,dc=com"
    [...]



dsconfig interactive mode use the component name in the message before printing component property list:

>>>> Configure the properties of the userRoot



Depending of which type of object, the message may appear to be odd to read for a user (as for the backend above).
A more common formulation would be to put quotes around component name and prefix it with its parent type such as:


>>>> Configure the properties of the JE Backend "userRoot"
