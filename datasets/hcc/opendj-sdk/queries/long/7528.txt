A bug in verify-index code makes it consider valid VLVIndex as being corrupted.

How to reproduce:

	Setup DS with dsEvaluation profile
	Add a VLV Index named description with filter(&), whole-subtree and sort key +description*
	rebuild-index --degradedIndex
	verify-index -b "dc=exmple,dc=com" -i vlv.description



On step 4, verify-index generates tons of error message about the VLV Index being corrupt while it has just been rebuilt.

Acceptance criteria:

	A VLVIndex must not be considered as being invalid by verify-index if it has been rebuild using rebuild-index
