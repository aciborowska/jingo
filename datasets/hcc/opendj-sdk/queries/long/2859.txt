i have created a new password policy (see attached file with the value of lockout-failure-count:3)
and attached to some user i have created .(according the user.ldif + userObject attached files).
i folwoed the instructions according to this url :
http://idmdude.com/2014/04/22/understanding-openam-and-opendj-account-lockout-behaviors/

after i do the same steps described in the url , i notice that the attribute for 
pwdAccountLockedTime updated with the current date.however , the attribute 'inetuserstatus' remain ACTIVE.
so, in this case ,the  account remain active although it has to be locked
