Scenario
1. Install OpenDJ in interactive mode:

./setup --cli --backendType pdb --baseDN dc=com --sampleData 4000 --ldapPort 1389 --adminConnectorPort 4444 --rootUserDN cn=dm --rootUserPassword www --no-prompt --noPropertiesFile --acceptLicense
...
Do you accept the License Agreement?yes
See /tmp/opendj-setup-8224594245514485708.log for a detailed log of this
operation.

Configuring Directory Server ..... Done.
Importing Automatically-Generated Data (4000 Entries) .......... Done.
Starting Directory Server ........ Done.

To see basic server configuration status and configuration you can launch
/home/user/opendj/bin/status


Result: The file mentioned in setup output "/tmp/opendj-setup-8224594245514485708.log" doesn't exist.

2. Install another instance of OpenDJ using GUI.
Result: /tmp/opendj-setup-*.log file mentioned at the end of setup GUI process exists.

Expected behavior
Log files generated by setup tool should be handled in same way as in command line setup. 

Actual behavior
In comparison with expected behavior the GUI tool doesn't remove the /tmp/opendj-setup-*.log file. In case of command line setup, the file is removed (see OPENDJ-2540's comments).

Note
I didn't notice this behavior in 2.6.3 version. With OpenDJ 2.6.3 we have /tmp/opendj-setup-*.log file in both cases (command line setup and GUI setup).
