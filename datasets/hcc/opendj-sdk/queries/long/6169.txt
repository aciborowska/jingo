On daily test, we encountered issue with default root_dn user on `security_group/LockdownMode`. Test runs alright on Linux, only Windows causes problem. 
Here is link to Jenkins run we made to test this issue: https://ci.forgerock.org/view/PyForge/job/pyforge_tests_debug_windows/99/

There is 1 DJ instance configured. 

Problem happens during Setup phase, when Lockdown mode is applied. Seems like it is problem with default root_dn:

ldapmodify.bat -h dj-win2012r2.internal.forgerock.com -p 1391 -D "uid=admin" -w password 
dn: ds-task-id=Enter Lockdown Mode,cn=Scheduled Tasks,cn=tasks 
objectClass: top
objectClass: ds-task
ds-task-id: Enter Lockdown Mode
ds-task-class-name: org.opends.server.tasks.EnterLockdownModeTask
ERROR:
-- rc --
returned 53, expected to be in [0]
-- stdout --
# The LDAP modify request failed: 53 (Unwilling to Perform)
# Additional Information:  Only users with the SERVER_LOCKDOWN privilege connected from a loopback address may place the server in lockdown mode



Command to reproduce:

./run-pybot.py -s security_group.Lockdown* opendj
