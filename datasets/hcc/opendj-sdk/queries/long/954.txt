DS1, DS2, connected to RS, replication is enabled and initialized. replication-purge-delay is reduced on RS to make testing quicker.


	Shut down DS2.
	Add <o=parent,dc=example,dc=com> on DS1
	Add <ou=child,o=parent,dc=example,dc=com> on DS1
	Wait for the replication-purge-delay period to expire.
	Restart DS2.



On DS2 I see <entryuuid=b8bbac47-f4c8-4122-a06e-cb6872165798+ou=child,dc=example,dc=com> but no evidence of the parent entry. The conflict is logged.

Replication status shows no missing changes, but reports one more entry in DS1 than DS2.
