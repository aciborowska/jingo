Two 5.5.0 DS+RS nodes are replicating correctly.

The nodes are upgraded in a rolling upgrade, as per the upgrade instructions.


	Node 1 is stopped and upgraded to DS 6.0. Node 1 is restarted.
	Node 2 is stopped and upgraded to DS 6.0. Node 2 is restarted.



There are no errors on startup.

Entries added at this point on node 1 are replicated to node 2, and vice versa.

However dsreplication status reports "No replication information found.":


$ dsreplication status \
          --hostname acheron.local \
          --port 4444 \
          --adminUid admin \
          --adminPassword ****** \
          --trustAll \
          --no-prompt
No replication information found.


If you create and replicate 2 new DS 6.0 servers, dsreplication status does work as expected.
