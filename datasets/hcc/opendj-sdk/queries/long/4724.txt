A filter such as (&(objectclass=*)(changeNumber>=xxx)(changeNumber<=yyy)) is treated by the ChangelogBackend as a search in the ChangeNumberRange { xxx, -1 }, and we can indeed see the server cursoring from xxx to the end of the index.

The logic in optimizeSearchUsingFilter appears to have been improved by commit c1a746a37c. It looks fixed to me, though the TODO comment in the code suggests otherwise. We should backport this.
