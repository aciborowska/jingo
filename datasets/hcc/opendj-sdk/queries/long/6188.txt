When the server detects that the backend's disk is hitting the low threshold mark, we currently return an Unwilling to Perform error with a "There are insufficient resources to perform the operation" error message.
Unwilling to Perform is a permanent type of error, and it prevents applications from understanding that they could failover the operation to another server (typically our SDK's connection pools).
 We should be returning an Unavailable result code which is a transient error (and treated as such by our SDK).
