On couple of attempts out of many DS servers are not timing out and switching over when the RS process is stoppped (kill -STOP)

Example have 4 servers DS1, RS2, RS3, DS4.

start process = kill -CONT

Steps

	stop process on RS2, watch for connections from DS1,DS4 switch to RS3
	start process on RS2, stop process on RS3 before DS1 switches back to RS2 (best server)
	stop process on RS3, DS1/DS4 never switch to RS2.



All operations on DS1/DS4 are then unwilling to perform, no replication server available.

This is difficult to reproduce.
