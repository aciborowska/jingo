After I moved the ACI allowing proxied authz from a global ACI to an aci on dc=example,dc=com the evaluation profile, https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/OPENDJ/repos/opendj/browse/opendj-server/resource/setup-profiles/DS/evaluation/7.0/base-entries.ldif#38 , doc tests validating DS proxy account access to the DS/RSs started failing with "unavailable critical extension" for the proxied authz control.

Not sure if it makes any difference, but the proxy account in this case uses the "best practice" of authenticating with a certificate, rather than a simple bind.

To reproduce the issue, run the doc tests:

$ git clone ssh://git@stash.forgerock.org:7999/opendj/opendj-docs.git
$ cd opendj-docs
$ mvn clean -Ptest -Dskip.docker.build=false verify -Dexec.args="install-guide/setup_proxy.bats"

(I'm currently trying to fix those tests, so search for this Jira ID in the source to see if you need to comment out a workaround or two.)
