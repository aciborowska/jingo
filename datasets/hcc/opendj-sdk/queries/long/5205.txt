 The encode-password command outputs additional characters:


Encoded Password:  "{FOO}bar"

This makes it a pain to use in shell scripts - where the additional prefix characters need to be stripped using sed.  The output should look like:


{FOO}bar

There is no need for the additional prefix - the user already knows the purpose of the command. If error information is required, it should be written to stderr, and a non zero exit code produced.
