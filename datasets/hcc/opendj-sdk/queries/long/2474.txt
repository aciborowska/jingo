Found using OpenDJ 3.0.0 rev 1e0c0d14ac782f000c08b622585dbd73390d4157

Scenario

	install old DJ version (2.6.3 for instance)
	stop the instance
	extract the new DJ version
	start the server before doing the upgrade
=> so we expected the start to fail with a message "Please run upgrade before continuing"
