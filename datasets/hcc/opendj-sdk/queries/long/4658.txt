All tools using InitializationBuilder to start part of the DirectoryServer becomes unusable as soon as the configuration is using attributes from a 3rd party schema.
 This should include (while not tested): BackendStat, BackUpDb, EncodePassword, ExportLdif, ImportLdif, RebuildIndex, ReplicationServerSetup, RestoreDb, VerifyIndex.

Here an example output with import-ldif when the OpenIDM plugin is installed:

./bin/import-ldif --offline -n userRoot -c -l ~/ldifs/500k_entries.ldif
An error occurred while attempting to initialize server components to run the
tool: An error occurred while attempting to initialize the password policy
components:  An error occurred while trying to decode the managed object
configuration entry cn=OpenIDM Notification Handler,cn=Account Status
Notification Handlers,cn=config: The Openidm Account Status Notification
Handler could not be decoded due to the following reasons: The
"certificate-subject-dn" property must be specified as it is mandatory; The
"openidm-url" property must be specified as it is mandatory
