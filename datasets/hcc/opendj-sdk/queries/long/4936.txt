Duration metrics (Attribute type with syntax: 1.3.6.1.4.1.36733.2.1.3.4 DESC 'Duration in milli-seconds' X-SUBST '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27') are outputted as metric_name_time_seconds in Prometheus but are not converted to second, the outputted value is still in millisecond. 
 This issue can be closed when (in preferred order):

	The duration is converted to second
	Or the suffix is changed from "_seconds" to "_milliseconds"
	Or the suffix ("_seconds") is removed
