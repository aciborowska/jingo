Matt noticed there was a lock held on org.opends.server.backends.task.TaskScheduler.schedulerLock, and it seems to happen on a directory server shutdown in the JVM.

It may have been caused by https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/OPENDJ/repos/opendj/commits/310447cb2c3f39dd2f6b39ab38c14bcbe2493406 .
