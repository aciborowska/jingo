NOTE: this problem may also apply to the other profiles.

The AM CTS profile adds indexes for common user attributes including cn, sn, etc. These include substring indexes which have a very high performance impact. In addition, the AM CTS profile is also adding an index for etag, which is very dubious because it is a virtual attribute.

Robert Wapshott Craig McDonnell - was there any reason why AM documentation asks users to add an index for the LDAP "etag" attribute? This attribute is a virtual attribute which cannot be indexed. However, I'm wondering if there's a typo in the doc - perhaps another etag-like attribute should be indexed?
