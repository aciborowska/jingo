Reported by Chris Clifton:

When performing a PUT where none of the user details have changed, I get the following response:


{
    "code": 400,
    "reason": "Bad Request",
    "message": "Constraint Violation: Entry uid=user.1,ou=People,dc=internal,dc=forgerock,dc=com cannot be updated because the request did not contain any modifications"
}


I'm not easily able to tell when no changes have been made. Is there a way I can get OpenDJ to either:

	Not return an error when no modifications are made
	Get an error message which contains some information I can use to identify this case. I could parse the above message field to get this information, but obviously that isn't ideal.



This is in effect similar to what the permissive control modify is doing, but the permissive control modify explicitly restricts itself to LDAP add and LDAP deletes.

Rest2LDAP should return a status code 200 in such case.
