When installing using QuickSetup.jnlp, I suffered from a couple of problems:

1) First I chose a folder that did not exist (/apps/OpenDJ) when the installer was about to download OpenDJ-2.4.1BETA1.zip, it simply gives an error:

See /tmp/opends-setup-5062204517782811433.log for a detailed log of this operation.
 Downloading ..... Stopping Directory Server ..... 
    Could not retrieve zip file OpenDJ-2.4.0BETA1.zip. The input stream is null. 

(log attached)

2) Then I reopen the Installer and point again to /apps/OpenDJ but now the folder exists. Same error on screen, new log attached opends-setup-792985265173697375.log)


Will simply download the zip and install it directly.
