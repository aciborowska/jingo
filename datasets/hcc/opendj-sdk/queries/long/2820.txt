Found with OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev 10f0e9c1ad2e1296678c3706152a84437da35a78

We install and set up a server.
Then we try to use the list-backends command without any options.
We get a NullPointerException:


./DJ1/opendj/bin/list-backends 
An error occurred while trying to read backend information from the server
configuration:  NullPointerException(ListBackends.java:424)
