Currently online tasks backend restore fails with this error:
 There are no tasks defined with ID '20180522180350507'

We discussed with Matthew Swift and agreed we would not support online restore of tasks backend.
 Instead of a misleading error message we should output something like "online restore is not supported for the tasks backend"

Step to reproduce:
Â  - start DJ

$ backup  -d <path-to-bakup-dir> --backendId "tasks" -p 4444 -w password -X
$ restore -d <path-to-backup-dir>  -p 4444 -w password -X
