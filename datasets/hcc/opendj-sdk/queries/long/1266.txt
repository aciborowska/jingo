Using a server with 2000 sample entries, I created an equality index for "description" and built the index.

I used dsconfig to delete the index and then stopped the server.

Using DbDump -h db/userRoot -l | grep description I verified that the index data had been deleted.

But I ran DbDump -h db/userRoot -s dc_example_dc_com_state -p and saw:


VERSION=3
format=print
type=btree
dupsort=0
HEADER=END
 _aci.presence
 \01
 _cn.equality
 \01
 _cn.substring
 \01
 _description.equality
 \01
[...]



It doesn't look like the state index got updated correctly, or at all.

This causes problems in the future if the same index is recreated; the index state of the new index will come from the previous index's state, which is unlikely to be correct.
