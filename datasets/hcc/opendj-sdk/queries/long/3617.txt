ldifdiff is missing key options that the older version ldif-diff has.

The following are missing from the new ldifdiff:



-a, --ignoreAttrs {file}
    File containing a list of attributes to ignore when computing the
    difference
--checkSchema
    Takes into account the syntax of the attributes as defined in the schema
    to make the value comparison.  The provided LDIF files must be conform to
    the server schema
-e, --ignoreEntries {file}
    File containing a list of entries (DN) to ignore when computing the
    difference



These options can be critical if being used to diff configuration files for changes.  Not having --ignoreAttrs and --ignoreEntries is key if ldifdiff is being used to apply updates from one cn=config etc. backend to another.  In many cases, --ignoreAttrs and --ignoreEntries are required in order to save time and to avoid errors.

They are also crucial in being able to ignore various elements that cannot be applied to existing config such as all operations attributes:


	modifyTimestamp
	modifiersName
	createTimestamp
	creatorsName
	entryUUID
	and so on.
