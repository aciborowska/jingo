In admin guide, procedure to enable debug logging includes a step 3 to restart the server.  (https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/6/admin-guide/#troubleshoot-enable-debug-logging).
However, this is not necessary, the change is applied immediately at runtime.
I think this is the case since issue OPENDJ-1289 has been fixed.
