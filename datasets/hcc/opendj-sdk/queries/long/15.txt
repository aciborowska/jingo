This issue was detected when trying to import legacy schema from old versions of OpenSSO project.
When adding schema over LDAP to an OpenDJ server, if there are 2 definitions of objectclasses both AUXILIARY, one being a superior of the second, the server would reject the schema with the following error :
$ bin/ldapmodify -D cn=directory\ manager -w secret12 -p 1389 -h localhost -f ~/dummy.ldif 
Processing MODIFY request for cn=schema
MODIFY operation failed
Result Code:  21 (Invalid Attribute Syntax)
Additional Information:  When attempting to modify entry cn=schema to add one or more values for attribute objectClasses, value "( 999.1.1 NAME 'my-managed-filtered-group' DESC 'Managed Filter Group OC' SUP my-managed-group AUXILIARY X-ORIGIN 'test' )" was found to be invalid according to the associated syntax:  The definition for objectclass 999.1.1 is invalid because it has an objectclass type of AUXILIARY but this is incompatible with the objectclass type STRUCTURAL for the superior class my-managed-group

The superior objectclass is in fact declare as AUXILIARY as in the attached dummy.ldif file.
