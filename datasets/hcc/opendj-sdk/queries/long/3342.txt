Scenario
With OpenDJ installed and HTTP connection handler enabled I tried to access administration endpoints and request for API description.

I received HTTP Response with status code 200 and with content.

When I look more on the content itself I noticed is totally same for both endpoints (/admin/config and /admin/monitor).

Current behavior
Doing a request on /admin/config endpoint like:

http://pyforge.example.com:8080/admin/config/?_crestApi


and doing a request on /admin/monitor endpoint like:

http://pyforge.example.com:8080/admin/monitor/?_crestApi



works well, but the received contents are same.

In fact doing request on /admin endpoint returns same description like above requests.

Expected behavior
I expect 
1. different descriptions of those endpoints and some type of aggregated description when doing request on /admin endpoint from /admin/config and /admin/monitor.
or
2. Only one description on /admin . I don't see why we should have two additional endpoints (/admin/monitor and /admin/config) when we returns every time same description.

Note
I attached both outputs from above requests.
