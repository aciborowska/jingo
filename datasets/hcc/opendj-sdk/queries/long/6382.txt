When admin tool (e.g dsconfig, import-ldif,...) does not have the same version as the remote server, an error message is printed and the tool return a non zero error code, e.g:

Tool version '7.0.0' does not match remote server version '6.5.0'. Please use
the same tool version as the server one
$ echo $?
1


Return code 1 is associated to ERROR_UNEXPECTED which is not really helpful and misleading for the user.
Acceptance criteria

This issue can be closed when a result code will have been created for the use case described above and all impacted tools will use this new error RC when their version mismatch with server version.
