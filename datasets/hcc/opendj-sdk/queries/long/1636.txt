Disabling anonymous access (by setting reject-unauthenticated-requests to true) makes HTTP Connection Handler to fail with Error 500: "Operations Error: Rejecting the requested operation  because the connection has not been authenticated" on every requests.
Stack Trace:

It looks like it tries to execute the requests even though authentication wasn't performed.

I isolated the issue by testing the following:
1. Installed OpenDJ 2.6.0 with standards parameters and pre-populated with generated entries.
2. Enabled HTTP Connection Handler
curl --user user.0:password localhost:8080/users/user.1 works fine here
3. Disabled Anonymous Access by setting reject-unauthenticated-requests:true
4. The same curl request now fails on 500.
