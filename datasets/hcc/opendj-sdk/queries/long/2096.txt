Found using OpenDJ 2.8.0 in revision 12403.

Scenario:
************
1. install 2 servers
2. enable replication
3. run dsconfig in interactive mode, choose option 35 (Replication Server) and you get the following entries:

>>>> Replication Server management menu

What would you like to do?

    1)  Show the null
    2)  Create a new Replication Server
    3)  View and edit the Replication Server
    4)  Delete an existing Replication Server

    b)  back
    q)  quit

Enter choice [b]: 



=> title for first entry is wrong ("Show the null") and should be "List existing Replication Servers"
