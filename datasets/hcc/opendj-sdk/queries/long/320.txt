If the log-file-permissions property of a Log Publisher is set to 640, the log file will unfortunately have the permission 600.

I tested out some combinations and found out that the group permission is always set to the "other" permission (the third digit).
This means that the group permission is always wrong when the second and third digit in log-file-permissions are different.

I looked through the sources and maybe I found out what causes this issue:
In the FilePermission class, the setPermissions method prefers using the setUsingJava method instead of using the setUsingUNIX method. The setUsingJava method differentiates only between "owner" and "other" whereas the "group" permission is ignored.

Would it be possible to prefer the setUsingUNIX method, if "group" and "other" permissions are different? Or is there another way to set the correct permissions for the log files?
