When using "changeNumber=X,cn=changelog" as a baseDN for ldapsearch, it doesn't return an error for invalid changenumbers. Instead, it returns an empty string with RC=0.

Steps to reproduce:

	Setup two replicated DJs
	Make some modifications to generate changes in changelog
	Try searching for a specific change, using it as baseDN for ldapsearch





./bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w password -b "changeNumber=18,cn=changelog" "(&)"


4. Try the same, but use an invalid changenumber

Current behavior:

Returns empty string, RC=0

Expected behavior:

No Such Object (RC=32)


# The LDAP search request failed: 32 (No Such Entry)
# Additional Information: The search base entry 'changeNumber=#,cn=changelog' does not exist
# Matched DN: cn=changelolg
