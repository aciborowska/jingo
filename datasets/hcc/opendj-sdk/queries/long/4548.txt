There is a regression in our clu tests suites for ldapmodify used with a bad filename. It used to return 89, now it returns 80.


/DJ1/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h nameserver.example.com -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w password  -f bad

-- rc --
returned 80, expected 89
-- stdout --
# The LDAP modify request failed: 80 (Other)
# Additional Information:  An error occurred while attempting to open the LDIF file bad for reading:  bad (No such file or directory)
