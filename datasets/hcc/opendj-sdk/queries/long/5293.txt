OpenDJ 5.5.0 server setup as a Proxy server with the "Replication Service Discovery Mechanism" enabled. The replication servers defined in the "Replication Service Discovery Mechanism" are both OpenDJ 5.5.0 Replication only servers.
The Proxy server is logging these warnings in it's errors log at every "discovery-interval" as defined in the "Replication Service Discovery Mechanism".
EX:
Errors logged on proxy from my test server:
[18/Jun/2018:14:06:43 -0400] category=CORE severity=WARNING msgID=766 msg=Settings for Replica 'SearchResultEntry(name=cn=Johns-MacBook-Pro.local:7444,cn=Servers,cn=admin data, attributes=["hostname":["Johns-MacBook-Pro.local"], "ldapport":["-1"], "ldapsport":["-1"], "ldapEnabled":["false"], "ldapsEnabled":["false"], "startTLSEnabled":["false"]], controls=[])' do not allow connections for replication server group 'Replication Service Discovery Mechanism'

[18/Jun/2018:14:06:43 -0400] category=CORE severity=WARNING msgID=760 msg=Replication server 'Johns-MacBook-Pro.local:4444' references server 'cn=Johns-MacBook-Pro.local:7444,cn=Servers,cn=admin data' that could not be parsed correctly; the definition will be skipped

All functionality is working, the proxy is routing traffic as it should and replication is also working.
It is just a matter of these WARNING messages filling the log needlessly.

**Note that if the server defined in the "Replication Service Discovery Mechanism" is configured as a DS+RS server then the WARNING messages are NOT logged.**

I can provide detailed steps to recreate the issue but basically you just need to do the following.

	Create one DJ RS only server(7444) and one DJ DS+RS server(4444).
	Setup a OpenDJ 5.5 proxy server.
	Enable and configure the "Replication Service Discovery Mechanism" on the proxy server with settings similar to those below:"Replication Service Discovery Mechanism"
Property                           : Value(s)
----------------------------------:------------------------------------------
bind-dn                            : "cn=admin,cn=Administrators,cn=admin data"
bind-password                      : -
bind-password-environment-variable : -
bind-password-file                 : config/replication_bind_password
bind-password-property             : -
discovery-interval                 : 1 m
key-manager-provider               : -
primary-group-id                   : -
replication-server                 : Johns-MacBook-Pro.local:4444,Johns-MacBook-Pro.local:7444
ssl-cert-nickname                  : -
trust-manager-provider             : Blind Trust
use-ssl                            : false
use-start-tls                      : true



Afterwards you should see the WARNING messages logged for the RS only server but not the DS+RS server.
