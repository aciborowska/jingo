I am connected to a remote Linux machine via SSH - my local desktop is Windows and has no X server running, although Putty client is configured to forward X protocol (I do have X server installed, but in this case, I didn't have it running). The remote environment had the DISPLAY variable set:


	echo $DISPLAY
localhost:11.0



Steps:
unzip -d /opt OpenDJ-2.4.3.zip
cp -pR OpenDJ-2.4.3 ds-1
cd ds-1
./setup -i -b "dc=example,dc=com" -a -p 389 -w password123 -O -n

OpenDJ 2.4.3
Please wait while the setup program initializes...


X connection to localhost:11.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).


Note the "-i" parameter which should run the setup only in CLI mode, however it fails being unable to establish connection with the X. If the DISPLAY variable is unset, it works properly.
