Found with rev (00fd47957e5)

We have a split DS-RS topology of 2 DS - 2 RS, installed with 2.6.4 version, with data.
We check replication is working by performing some operations which populate the changelog.
We upgrade servers one by one.
Then we check the changelog and sometimes, the changelog is missing some entries and is not consistent between servers:

...
# Total number of matching entries: 9
