Running a server built from trunk, r12248 installing from the .zip under opendj-server-legacy, I encounter an error trying to initialize replication.

The dsreplication command does not recognize its initialize-all subcommand, despite including it in the list of available subcommands.


$ /path/to/opendj/bin/dsreplication initialize-all            --hostName laptop.example.com            --port 4444            --baseDN dc=example,dc=com            --adminUID admin            --adminPassword password            --trustAll            --no-prompt
An error occurred while parsing the command-line arguments: The provided
argument "initialize-all " is not recognized

...

Available subcommands:

...

initialize-all
    Initialize the contents of the data under the specified base DN on all the
    servers whose contents are being replicated with the contents on the
    specified server.  This operation is required after enabling replication
    for replication to work ('initialize' applied to each server can also be
    used for this purpose)
