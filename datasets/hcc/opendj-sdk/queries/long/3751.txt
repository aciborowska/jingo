There are three way in which we have to react on bad data coming from the client:

	The client sends an invalid ASN1 structure (e.g: random data): The Asn1Reader will detect invalid ASN1 content and throw a DecodeException which will close the client connection.
	The client sends a correctly formatted request but the content is invalid from a LDAP point of view (e.g: Search request with an invalid Dn). In that case the LdapListener must invokes the ReactiveHandler with an InvalidRequest.
	The client sends a valid LDAP message which is not a know request (e.g: a valid LDAP response object). The LdapListener must invokes the ReactiveHandler with an UnknownRequest
