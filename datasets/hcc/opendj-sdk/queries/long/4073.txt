When trying to deploy OpenAM to WildFly the following WARNING is emitted:

2017-06-07 08:56:47,586 WARN  [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-6) WFLYSRV0059: Class Path entry slf4j-jdk14-1.7.21.jar in /path/to/wildfly/standalone-1/deployments/openam.war/WEB-INF/lib/opendj-ldap-toolkit-4.1.0-M3.jar  does not point to a valid jar for a Class-Path reference.


The issue appears to be related to the fact that OpenAM excludes slf4j-jdk14 from the list of dependencies when bringing in opendj-server.
slfj4-jdk14 for most of the OpenDJ project is used as a test scope dependency, however for opendj-ldap-toolkit it becomes a compile time dependency, and as such it will be included in the toolkit ZIP artifact as well.

It would be good if we could make sure that slf4j-jdk14 doesn't get added to the MANIFEST's Class-Path entry. One way to do that would be to remove the maven-jar plugin configuration from opendj-ldap-toolkit/pom.xml, however this commit message suggests that it was intentionally added there in the first place.

Given that the ZIP has all the shell scripts necessary to add all JARs to the classpath (_script-util.sh appears to take care of this), maybe we can just remove this plugin definition from the POM altogether?
