Currently it is possible to edit any configuration file with dsconfig offline, this includes configuration files intended to be used by a different version from dsconfig itself. 

Because the configuration framework, hence dsconfig, is built on specific schema, dsconfig offline must be used on a config file that follows the same schema. 

With incompatible versions, dsconfig offline will allow non-schema-compliant modifications to the config file.

This issue can be closed once we have a mechanism to detect version mismatch between the binaries and the config file when using dsconfig offline.
