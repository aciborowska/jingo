On a topology with two servers, running dsreplication initialize may fail if run from the server not being the source, saying:


Error reading data from server local:4444.  There is an error with the
certificate presented by the server.
Details: simple bind failed: local:4444



Given two servers (M1 and M2), this happens when using M2/bin/dsreplication from M2, specifying as source server M1 and destination server M2.
Running inside instance M1 M1/bin/dsreplication, with the same source and destination server as before, works.
RC is most likely the fix for OPENDJ-2033, where resetting the connection info goes too far...
Note this is evident in interactive mode, since we need to accept user information. Script mode does not use the same objects hence it does not seem to be affected
