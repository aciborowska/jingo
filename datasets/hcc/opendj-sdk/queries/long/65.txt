This could be dsreplication itself or a side-effect of domain names being stripped in the replication monitoring or state.

This is a major issue in multi-site environments. In this case the user was not using SSL. They had configured replication with multiple replicas and using FQDNs throughout. When dsreplication enable was used to add a new replica they reported seeing that the host domain was stripped from the hostname during configuration.

It took them a while to debug the issue as it's pretty subtle. For this reason, and because it occurs during deployment, it may frighten new users and, in the worse case, result in replication updates being sent to the wrong host. Priority: major.
