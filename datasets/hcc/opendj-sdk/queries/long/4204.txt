Found using OpenDJ 4.1.0 (rev 0b7da454b79944f54e66daf3f591cefb5d77165b).

Due to recent changes on IDM side the IDM certificate owner has changed from:

CN=localhost, O=OpenIDM Self-Signed Certificate, OU=None, L=None, ST=None, C=None


to:

CN=openidm-localhost, O=OpenIDM Self-Signed Certificate, OU=None, L=None, ST=None, C=None



So we should update the value for "ds-cfg-certificate-subject-dn" field in the "openidm-accountchange-plugin-sample-config" file delivered in the PwdSyncPlugin to reflect that change.
