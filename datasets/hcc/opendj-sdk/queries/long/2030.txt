While trying to setup replication between two freshly installed server instance via dsreplication in interactive mode, the password for second server's administrator (not admin since here isn't any) is not asked:


> bin/dsreplication
What do you want to do?

    1)  Enable Replication
    2)  Disable Replication
    3)  Initialize Replication on one Server
    4)  Initialize All Servers
    5)  Pre External Initialization
    6)  Post External Initialization
    7)  Display Replication Status
    8)  Purge Historical

    c)  cancel

Enter choice: 1


>>>> Specify server administration connection parameters for the first server

Directory server hostname or IP address [mwood.local]:

Directory server administration port number [4444]:

Global Administrator User ID, or bind DN if no Global Administrator is defined
[admin]: cn=directory manager

Password for user 'cn=directory manager':
Replication port for the first server (the port must be free) [8989]:

Do you want replication to use encrypted communication when connecting to
replication port 8989 on the first server? (yes / no) [no]:



>>>> Specify server administration connection parameters for the second server

Directory server hostname or IP address [mwood.local]:

Directory server administration port number [4444]: 5444

Global Administrator User ID, or bind DN if no Global Administrator is defined
[admin]: cn=directory manager

Server Certificate:

User DN  : CN=mwood.local, O=Administration Connector Self-Signed Certificate
Validity : From 'Mon May 18 15:46:48 CEST 2015'
             To 'Sun May 13 15:46:48 CEST 2035'
Issuer   : CN=mwood.local, O=Administration Connector Self-Signed Certificate


Do you trust this server certificate?

    1)  No
    2)  Yes, for this session only
    3)  Yes, also add it to a truststore
    4)  View certificate details

Enter choice [2]:

You must choose at least one Base DN to be replicated.
Replicate base DN dc=example,dc=com? (yes / no) [yes]:



It seems to reuse the password of the first server for the second server too.
