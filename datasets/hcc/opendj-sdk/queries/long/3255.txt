Description
When I have run manual test for Control-Panel I discovered that if I click on Monitoring > General Information > Entry Cache,  the GUI became unresponsive to next selections of items from the list of General information sections.

 When the window (General information) is closed and re-opened again a user can not choose anything.
 A workaround is to close control-panel and re-run it.

Actual behavior
When click on Entry Cache section the GUI is not responsive and a user need to restart control-panel to be able select any other section.

Expected behavior
Show an info about 'Entry Cache' or do not show this section at all.
