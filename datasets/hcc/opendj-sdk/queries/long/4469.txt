In the tuning section of the OpenDJ admin guide:

https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/5.5/admin-guide/#perf-java
-Xmn

Set the new generation size between 1-4 GB for high-throughput deployments, but leave enough overall JVM heap to avoid overlaps with the space used for DB cache.

-XX:NewSize

If an OpenDJ server handles high throughput, set the new generation size large enough for the JVM to avoid promoting short-lived objects into the old generation space (-XX:NewSize=512M).
-Xmn and -XX:NewSize are different names for the same setting. -Xmn is the preferred setting to use. There is contradictory advice between the two settings, the advice on -XX:NewSize seems correct according to my discussions with Matthew Swift.

Perhaps this part of the docs should replace these two sections with:
-Xmn

If an OpenDJ server handles high throughput, set the new generation size large enough for the JVM to avoid promoting short-lived objects into the old generation space (-XX:NewSize=512M).
Please double check with Matthew Swift who knows a lot more about this than me
