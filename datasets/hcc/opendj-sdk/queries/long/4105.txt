Just unzip opendj zip file and run ./bin/start-ds
 The startup fails with the following error message:

The Directory Server could not acquire an exclusive lock on file /Space/Tests/XX/opendj/locks/server.lock: 
The attempt to obtain an exclusive lock on file /Space/Tests/XX/opendj/locks/server.lock was rejected 
because the attempt to create the lock file failed: 
IOException(No such file or directory). This generally means that another instance of this server is already running


The diagnostic is correct: "No such file or directory", because the instance hasn't been created yet, but the conclusion is erroneous and confusing.
