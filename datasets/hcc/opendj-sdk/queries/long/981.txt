Bug reported on the OpenDJ mailing list:

Hi

We are using OpenDJ embedded in servlet.
We use org.opends.server.util.EmbeddedUtils.startServer() to start the server, and org.opends.server.util.EmbeddedUtils.stopServer() to stop it.

After stopping it, the thread “Monitor Provider State Updater”  is still running. Looking at the OpenDJ source code, it is evidently an OpenDJ thread – see MonitorProvider.java

It looks like the MonitorProvider class should register itself as a ServerShutdownListener.
Then in the implementation of processServerShutdown(), it should call SCHEDULER.shutdownNow().
