https://backstage.forgerock.com/#!/docs/opendj/2.6.0/dev-guide#install-latest-sdk mentions the Nightly Builds page, rather than BackStage.

http://opendj.forgerock.org/doc/bootstrap/dev-guide/index.html#proc-roll-your-own-sdk has a mixup of SVN and git.

http://opendj.forgerock.org/doc/bootstrap/dev-guide/index.html#opendj-ldap-sdk-examples calls for a directory listing, which is not allowed at that site for example.

In general, the release docs really should not mention the nightly builds pages or getting the source code from svn/git as those are not ways to get a supported build.
