Index's trusted value is cached inside Index class to prevent systematic db lookup. 
The cached value might becomes incorrect if the transaction modifying the trusted flag is finally aborted through a rollback.



public final synchronized void setTrusted(WriteableTransaction txn, boolean trusted) throws StorageRuntimeException
{
  this.trusted = trusted;
  if (trusted) {
    state.addFlagsToIndex(txn, getName(), TRUSTED);
  } else {
    state.removeFlagsFromIndex(txn, getName(), TRUSTED);
  }
}



This problem might be marginal for JE since rollback should never happen.
In other hand, PDB rollback more often due to it's optimistic lock approach.
