Chapter 5 of the release notes uses two queries to provide the list of fixes in a release, and the list of known issues in a release.

The latter query needs to take account of how we create linked 'backport' issues. eg a trunk bug may have affectedVersions of 2.6.0 and 3.0.0, but now the trunk bug will only have a fixVersion of 3.0.0 and there will be a separate linked backport issue which has a fixVersion of 2.6.x.

This may be tricky to achieve.

We could consider changing affectedVersions on the original bug to only include 3.0.0, however this would lose us some potentially useful information about the scope of the bug.

An alternative would be to keep all the versions in the original bug's affectedVersions, and just move some to the backported bug when that is created.
