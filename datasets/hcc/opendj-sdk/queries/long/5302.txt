This issue follows up the issue #OPENDJ-5275: the migration from java.io to java.nio has some side effect in the exceptions thrown and how they are reported to the user.

	with the java.io API, a java.io.FileNotFoundException is thrown with a detailMessage set to the filename + "(No such file or directory)" (for Linux) or "The system cannot find the file specified)" (for Windows)
	with the java.nio API, a java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException is thrown with a detailMessage set to null




Steps:

	Setup a 6.5.0
	Start the instance
	Setup a working keystore with a password
	Run the following command (where /tmp/yourkeystore is the keystore):


./dsreplication reset-change-number \
    -h opendj.example.com \
    -p 4444 \
    -P /tmp/yourkeystore \
    -T fookeystore \
    -I "cn=Directory Manager" \
    -w password


	Choose menu [3] ("Yes, also add it to a trustore")
	Fill in a fake trustore path (eg "/foo/barkeystore")
	Fill in any password
	We may expect to have a specific output like that:


Password for keystore '/foo/barkeystore': 
Unable to trust the certificate permanently, certificate will be trusted only
for this session. Error details: /foo/barkeystore (No such file or directory)


but instead of ^^ we have:


Password for keystore '/foo/barkeystore': 
Unable to trust the certificate permanently, certificate will be trusted only
for this session. Error details: /foo/barkeystore


The end of the message is missing.



NOTE: the expected message was there prior to the refactoring that moved from java.io to java.nio. I've been able to get it with revision "cf670d07003a6410cf757ab079d233692b74936e".
The behaviour for versions before 6.5.0 seems to be different...

But I guess indicating the file does not exist may be helpful for the user.

NOTE2: once we've been mistaken with the path, the interactive mode starts from the beginning.
