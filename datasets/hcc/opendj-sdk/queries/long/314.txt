On Windows (in this case Windows server 2008r2 64 bit) if OpenDJ is enabled as a Windows service then there is an error when stopping the server with the control panel. OpenDJ java process is still running afterwards, but service manager indicates service has actually stopped.

Starting the server with control-panel works.

Plus seems ok with command line tools (bat\stop-ds.bat and bat\start-ds.bat)

Also possible to start/stop OpenDJ using Windows service manager.

It could be that just the starting/stopping services takes a hugh amount of time and control-panel gives up waiting. I notice on starting in the control-panel there is a --timeout 0 passed to start-ds. Did not see the same when stopping with control-panel.
