Although they are listed in the tools reference, the following are missing from the chapter on supported LDAP Controls, https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/6.5/reference/#chap-controls (and in the master branch as well):

2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.17 - real attributes only
 2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.19 - virtual attributes only

Note: The CSN control (and Get Symmetric Key extop) are for internal use, so not described in the reference.
