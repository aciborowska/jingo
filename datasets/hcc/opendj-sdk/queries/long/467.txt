Built two directories.  Installation was fine, running them is fine, but when I tried to setup replication, I get a failure.  The issue is the password.  When I change the directory manager password to one that doesn't have "$" or "." it works.  The password is fine for everything else, but replication/dsreplication fails with the password.
