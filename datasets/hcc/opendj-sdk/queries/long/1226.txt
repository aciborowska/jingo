This is an issue that was described in a blog post by Azimut Labs : http://azlabs.blogspot.fr/2013/11/openam-1100-upgrade-embedded-opendj.html
2.6.0 upgrade throws an exception when getting an invalid file under config/schema but had a different file suffix.
The schema config manager only reads .ldif files, and ignore the others. Likewise, the upgrade should ignore other files.
