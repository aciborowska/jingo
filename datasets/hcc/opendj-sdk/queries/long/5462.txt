Using DS 6.5.0 rev. afc92a1a0f404ad928fd0edad575592d64546a0f to setup it for AM as CTS with profile am-cts, I noticed it leads to incompatible configuration.

After configuration of AM (Default conf) and configuration of AM to use DS CTS configured with profile am-cts according to doc cts-openam-guide , I am not able to log in to AM as amAdmin which was possible before connecting AM with DS CTS.

I have attached am-cts-deployment.zip, with prepared scripts and configfiles to install DS and AM:

	step by step according to doc for CTS and AM configuration
	with profile am-cts



The README.md file contains all additional steps to validate functionality of DS as CTS for AM. However with profile am-cts I was't able to achieve working configuration.

NOTE: To be able to run scripts you need to download following archives: OpenAM-6.5.0-SNAPSHOT.zip, opendj-6.5.0-SNAPSHOT.zip, apache-tomcat-8.5.31.zip and put them to archives folder.
