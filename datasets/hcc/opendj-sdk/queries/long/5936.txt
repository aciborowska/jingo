The amount of memory allocated to the JE shared cache is the amount of memory available maintained by the MemoryQuota object.
Due to a bug in JEStorage, the amount of memory specified into the ds-cfg-db-cache-size is mistakenly reserved from MemoryQuota which makes it unavailable for the JE shared cache.
