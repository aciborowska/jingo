The org.opends.server.tools.ImportLDIFTestCase unit test was failing in the nightly builds because the org.opends.server.tasks.TestImportAndExport test was accidentally leaking the temporary shared JE environment used for performing DN validation.

The problem is caused by the Importer which fails to close the temporary environment in all error conditions (e.g. missing LDIF import file).
