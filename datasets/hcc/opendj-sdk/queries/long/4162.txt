The customer has the old File Based Access Logging enabled, as well as the new JSON audit logger. Both logs are being produced, and rotated as expected.

However the customer is seeing very frequent errors logging of:



[14/Jul/2017:12:32:39 +0000] category=org.opends.messages.external severity=ERROR msgID=1 msg=Unexpected failure exception=NullPointerException (Objects.java:203 Arrays.java:3813 Arrays.java:3800 TimeStampFileNamingPolicy.java:113 SizeBasedRetentionPolicy.java:33 JsonFileWriter.java:484 JsonFileWriter.java:367 JsonFileWriter.java:315 Executors.java:511 FutureTask.java:308 ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:180 ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:294 ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142 ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617 Thread.java:745)



It looks like this was fixed in commons audit in 870293fc2fd, so the bug should not be present in OpenDJ master.
