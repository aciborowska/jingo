When there are nested backends, hasSubordinates is set incorectly, eg :


<c=AU>  db/userRoot
   <o=South,c=AU>  db/southRoot
   <o=North,c=AU>  db/northRoot



The entry for c=AU will have hasSubordinates: false

Note that the parent c=AU backend is actually literally empty, it exists only to provide common referencing to the subordinate backends.

Each subordinate backend is replicated differently, so needs to be separate under the current replication model.

This confuses the GUI client (Apache Directory Studio) as it does not check for children of the baseDn, unless hasSubordinates of the parent is true.
