The need to inform user about this was implemented by https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENDJ-5856 but since merge of https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/OPENDJ/repos/opendj/pull-requests/4724/overview  the warn is no more part of restore tool help output. 

 

To reproduce the issue configure server with default values and run:

/path/to/opendj/bin/restore --help | grep offline

There is new tool dsbackup but it's help output is almost empty, so I think we should have this warning in restore until the new tool is fully functional.
