Found with opendj 6.0.0 rev (059b28312ae)

We setup a server with some data.
Then we use export-ldif with -i and a selection of attributes:


./DJ1/opendj/bin/export-ldif --offline -l /tmp/export_includeattr.ldif -n userRoot -i "dc" -i "cn" -i "ou" -i "sn" -i "uid"



In the ldif file produced by the command, all the object classes are missing:


dn: dc=com
dc: com

dn: dc=example,dc=com
dc: example

dn: ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
ou: People

dn: uid=tmorris,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
sn: Morris
cn: Ted Morris
ou: Accounting
ou: People
uid: tmorris
...



It used to include them correctly in previous versions.
