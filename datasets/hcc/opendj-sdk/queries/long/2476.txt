Scenario

	install 2 servers and enable replication
	set the purge delay to one hour
	run a modrate on the first server



After one hour (when the purge starts) we can see that the changelog size stops growing as expected.
But after some times it seems that the purge becomes very slow and the changelog size grows again.
