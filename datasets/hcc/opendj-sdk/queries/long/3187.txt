Scenario
1. Install OpenDJ-2.4.5
2. Unzip OpenDJ-3.5.0-OEM-RC1 over it (rev 90fe40d67ad97ed369c05acdf0d52950240aff81)
3. run upgrade

Current behavior
During upgrade I hit FAIL status when the tool tries to copy http-config.json.

Expected behavior
Due to changes in rest2ldap endpoints configuration the file http-config.json should not be copied by the upgrade tool and instead of that should be created a correct folder with name "rest2ldap" and with it's known structure and content.
