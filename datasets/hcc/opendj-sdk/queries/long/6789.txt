The bootstrap-replication-server property for a Replication Synchronization Provider does essentially the same thing as the replication-server property for a Replication Service Discovery Mechanism.

The former takes host:repl-port and the latter takes host:admin-port.

The setup command has an option for the former, --bootstrapReplicationServer, but when setting up a proxy server you must --set ds-proxy-server/replicationServers in the profile instead.

The configuration would be easier to understand if these discrepancies were eliminated.
