On a search request to cn=changelog (changeNumber mode, a.k.a. draft mode), when the changelogCookie attribute is requested, computing its value require cursoring through all the changes from the start of the replica DBs, which is highly inefficient when replica DBs are very large.

The most efficient solution would be to position the cursors on each replica DBs on the record that comes immediately before theÂ CSN read from the change number index DB.
