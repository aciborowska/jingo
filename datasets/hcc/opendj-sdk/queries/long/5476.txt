DS proxy servers perform load balancing for the following purposes:

	Distributing data across multiple shards to scale out (distribution)
	Consistently sending requests for the same entry to the same server (affinity)
	Equitably routing requests based on directory servers' available capacities (least requests)
	Routing requests around servers that are not available (failover)



This must be very clear in the documentation.

Best practices must be clear as well:

	Configure failover to route requests to local servers first, remote servers if necessary
	Use affinity if at all possible. Many applications need a consistent view of the data they change, even if they read immediately after writing.
	Use least requests only if you cannot use affinity.
	Use distribution when you have reached your limit scaling up and need to scale out instead.
