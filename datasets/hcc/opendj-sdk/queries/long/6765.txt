I found this issue, while I was writing test for OPENDJ-6644 which allows to configure replication during setup using --bootstrapReplicationServer and --replicationPort options.

In one of them I extract and setup two DJs (one of them with sample data) with --bootstrapReplicationServer and -replicationPort options, and then start them.
 After that I tried to run dsreplication initialize-all but it failed due to Invalid credentials - but the credentials were correct.

I also tried to to skip initialize-all and just run ldapsearch to see if the entries were replicated, but it found entries only on one of the servers (one which was setup with --sampleData option)

I am not sure if you want to fix this in dsreplication as it is planned to be replaced by dsrepl tool.
