Trying to connect to remote OpenDJ instances using a local OpenDJ 'control-panel'

On the server-side configure an OpenDJ instance.

On the client just unzip OpenDJ distro (e.g. zip-archive).

On the client launch 'control-panel' with '--remote' parameter, e.g.

"./control-panel --remote -h opendj26-1.enteprise.com -p 3444"

This will result in ...

"The version of the installed OpenDJ could not be determined because the
version file '/OpenDJ-Deployment/opendj-260/./config/buildinfo'
could not be found. Restore it from backup before continuing"
