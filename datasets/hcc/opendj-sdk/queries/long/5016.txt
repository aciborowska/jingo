In OpenDJ 3.5.3, syslog messages were sent using the process name as "OpenDJ"

However, in DS 5.5, syslog messages are being sent using the syslog_process name as "Forgerock"

We had a ticket where they complained that this change is not documented and as a result, they had not adjusted for the change, causing them to miss the logs related to a high priority incident.
