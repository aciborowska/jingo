When a commons-config expression using the "file:" pattern is used on Windows OS, the path value is not correct due to path separator "\" used by Windows, which is interpreted as an escape character by the commons-config API.

As a result,Â "&
{file:some\path}
" is interpreted as the relative path file "somepath" and the file is not found.
