After changes for OPENDJ-4501 the README for the example-plugin should be updated.

Currently we have the following steps:

# 6. Copy the example-plugin's content into the parent OpenDJ installation:

     cp -r target/opendj-server-example-plugin-*/* ..

# 7. This will copy the following files:

#     lib/extensions/opendj-server-example-plugin-*.jar
#     lib/extensions/commons-lang3-3.3.2.jar      (included to demonstrate how to include a 3rd party dependency)
#     config/example-plugin.ldif
#     config/schema/99-example-plugin.ldif
#     README.example.plugin



Using a fresh install the schema folder is no more "config/schema" but "db/schema" so the "cp" command mentioned in step 6 is not more valid for a fresh install.
But this command is valid if we have upgraded the instance to 6.0.0.

So we should mention these 2 cases in the README.
