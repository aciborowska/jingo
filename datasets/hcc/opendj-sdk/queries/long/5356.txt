As part of -OPENDJ-5006-, a 6.5 upgrade task was added to move admin-backend.ldif from db/admin/ to db/adminRoot/ (see this PR)

This was to align the adminRoot backup directory name with adminRoot backend directory name. 
 We agreed with Matthew Swift that moving files around during upgrade is error prone and should be avoided.

This issue can be closed when one of the following has been done, in the preferred order:

	Keep admin-backend.ldif in db/admin for older versions upgraded to 6.5 and have admin-backend.ldif in db/adminRoot for fresh 6.5 installs. (This may not be technically possible).
	Revert the changes introduced this PR (keep admin-backend.ldif in db/admin for all versions).
