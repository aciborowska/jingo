Found on 2.7.0 (revision 11222) and 3.0.0 (revision 11227).

Problem appears with both je and file-based changelog.

Scenario:
*********
-install 2 servers with some automatically-generated data and enable replication

	add 5 entries
	search on cn=changelog => 5 changes
	set purge delay to 20s on each server
	wait 60s
	search on cn=changelog => still 5 changes
