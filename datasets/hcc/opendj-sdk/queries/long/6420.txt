Since commit 859c3c05f68, dsconfig and server tools ensure that configuration and server full version (i.e including the SCM revision) are the same before running.

Since at the moment, dsconfig and server binary version are read from different sources (Version.getSdkVersion() and BuildVersion.binaryVersion()), we might end up while developing to build an archive where version mismatch:

~/git/opendj $ mvn clean install
~/git/opendj $ git commit --amend ...
~/git/opendj $ cd opendj-server
~/git/opendj/opendj-server $ mvn clean install
~/git/opendj/opendj-server $ ... # setup server
~/git/opendj/opendj-server $ ... # dsconfig fails with:
...
Other: There was an error trying to read the remote server version: Other:
Tool version does not match remote server version. Please use the same tool
version as the server one.
Tool version: '7.0.0.b1588d164a5b8f4a3e9a192723ca062a8908d1f4'
Server version: '7.0.0.150a26649d97e233f8a9b65d117b0b765cb26406'


This is annoying since it forces developers to rebuild the whole project each time a commit is made.
Acceptance criteria

This issue could be closed when the server will get its binary version from the same source as dsconfig, i.e Version#getSdkVersion().
