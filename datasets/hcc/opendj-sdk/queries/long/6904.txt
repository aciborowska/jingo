When used setup or setup-profile with option --help, then the temporary file is created however the command passed and the temporary file is not deleted. 

Steps to reproduce:

	Download and unzip latest OpenDJ 7.0.0 snapshot
	Run setup command with help option

./setup --help

	
		opendj-setup-*.log file created at tmp folder  opendj-setup-12434153121549115695.log
	
	
	Run setup-profile command with help option

./bin/setup-profile --help

	
		opendj-setup-profile-*.log file created at tmp folder  opendj-setup-profile-17084554331605443090.log
	
	



I suppose that temporary file should not be created or should be removed after successful finish command.
