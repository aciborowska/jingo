The documentation for REST queryFilters is a little hard to follow. The use of braces and negation is almost an aside right at the end, and could perhaps do with examples.

Perhaps a set of examples comparing LDAP filters with their equivalent REST filters would be helpful?

The QueryFilter javadoc is reasonably concise and easy to follow if you can read ABNF.
