The 2.5.0 functional tests are sometimes failing due to OpenDJ not
shutting down, specifically this is with the replication tests.

Looking at the stack there seems to be little in there. I've added
some addition info. to the tests to see what server is doing at
shutdown, but in meantime i've attached stacks from consecutive days
in case anything obvious leaps out.

Stack trace shows that the only live thread is the replication heartbeat monitor which is currently sleeping for 10s intervals:
