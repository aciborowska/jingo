A single backend contains <dc=first,dc=com> and <dc=second,dc=com> suffixes, each with at least 20k test users. Both servers have this same configuration.

Use dsreplication initialize-all to initialize both suffixes from the source server to the target server.

At the same time the initialize-all is working, start a bulk add of new entries to under <dc=second,dc=com>.

After the work is all complete, there will be one replication conflict logged on the target server for every entry added by the bulk add when <dc=first,dc=com> is being initialized. As soon as <dc=first,dc=com> is finished and <dc=second,dc=com> starts being initialized, the replication conflicts stop.


[26/Nov/2013:15:07:54 +0000] category=CORE severity=NOTICE msgID=458891 msg=The Directory Server has sent an alert notification generated by class org.opends.server.replication.plugin.LDAPReplicationDomain (alert type org.opends.server.replication.UnresolvedConflict, alert ID 15138885):  An unresolved conflict was detected for DN cn=julee miltenburg,ou=test,dc=second,dc=com



The entries do end up on the target server, so the errors seem spurious.

If you repeat this, but with each suffix in a separate backend, you don't get these spurious replication conflicts.
