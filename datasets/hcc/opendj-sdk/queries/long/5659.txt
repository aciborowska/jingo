Found with RC2.

We set up a proxy with 3 DJs and define some partition base dn under o=example which is the base dn for DJs.
We try to modify this base dn through the proxy.
It fails as expected but the error message is dumped on stdout and was expected to be written on stderr.


./PROXY/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h nameserver.example.com -p 1392 -D "uid=data admin,o=example" -w password 	
dn: o=example
changetype: modify
add: description
description: MODIFY THROUGH PROXY 	

-- rc --
returned 71, effectively in [71]
-- stdout --
# The LDAP modify request failed: 71 (Affects Multiple DSAs)
# Additional Information:  The request cannot be processed because it is above all the partition DNs
