Found using OpenDJ dev branch (revision 11306).

I configured a server and enabled the SNMP connection handler.

Then I tried to do a snmpwalk on the mib and I got the following error:

$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c OpenDJ@OpenDJ localhost:11161
iso.3.6.1.2.1.66.1.1.1.1 = STRING: "OpenDJ 3.0.0 - 20141114102029Z"
Error in packet.
Reason: (genError) A general failure occured
Failed object: iso.3.6.1.2.1.66.1.1.1.1



I tried all the get all the oid and the problem seems to be with dsServerDescription (iso.3.6.1.2.1.66.1.1.2.1):

$ snmpget -v 2c -c OpenDJ@OpenDJ localhost:11161 iso.3.6.1.2.1.66.1.1.2.1
Error in packet
Reason: (genError) A general failure occured
Failed object: iso.3.6.1.2.1.66.1.1.2.1



I attached a script to reproduce the problem (don't forget to get jdmkrt.jar).
