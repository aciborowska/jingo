Running a modrate test against DJ2.8 (including fix for OPENDJ-2136 => checkpoint 15s), on a 5M users DB (persistit), we get good performance for 10h (between 25k and 30k ops/sec) then the performance unexpectedly drops with no obvious cause (see modrate throughput chart in attachment):

	no apparent peak for system resources usage (cpu, mem disk IO)
	DB size pretty constant during the whole run
