Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 RC5.

Found this issue while validating the MSI package for which the default the installation is "C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenDJ".
After installation with MSI package, I tried to setup an instance and the server failed to start:

...
Validating parameters..... Done
Configuring certificates..... Done
Configuring server..... Done
Starting directory server.....Error......
Error Starting Directory Server.
