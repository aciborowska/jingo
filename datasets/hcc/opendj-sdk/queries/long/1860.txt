Found using revision r11800.

When we start the server (with SNMP enabled) we have the following messages:

[26/Feb/2015:16:40:01 +0100] category=ADMIN severity=NOTICE msgID=org.opends.messages.extension.571 msg=Loaded extension from file /tmp/opendj/lib/extensions/snmp-mib2605.jar' (build 3.0.0", revision 11800)
...



==> for the first message "Loaded extension from file..." the category is wrong  and should be "EXTENSIONS"
