Client tools allow a user to provide a key store within the command line options in the case where the remove server needs SSL client auth.

Before 6.5.0 and OPENDJ-4740, the only option available was -K, --keyStorePath {keyStorePath}.

With versions >= 6.5.0, we now have the following ones:

	--useJavaKeyStore {keyStorePath}
	--useJceKeyStore {keyStorePath}
	--usePkcs12KeyStore {keyStorePath}
	--usePkcs11KeyStore



To handle use case where a key store contains multiple certificate, the option -N, --certNickname {nickname} can be used to disambiguate certificate(s) to send to the server.

The issue is that when the nickname option is not provided on the command line, the key store option which may have been provided will simply gets ignored, in other words key store will never be loaded and transferred to the SSLOptions used for connection to the server.

Fixing this issue would imply to handle the following use cases:


	Then, if the key store contains only one private key entry , automatically select the associated certificate public key during SSL client auth
	Otherwise (i.e either the key store does not contain private key entry or it contains multiple private key entries so that there is an ambiguity), print a meaningful error message explaining the issue on the console
