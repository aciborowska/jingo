When navigate to pbkdf2-iterations property for PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 at dsconfig interactive then we can see option "Reset to the default value: 10000", however default value was changed to 10 (OPENDJ-6855). If try this option or call equivalent non-interactive cmd than the property is changed to 10000.

Steps to reproduce:

	Download, unzip and setup & run latest snapshot OpenDJ 7.0.0
	Use dsconfig tool in interactive mode




	
	
		After specify OpenDJ ldap connection parameters select Password Storage Scheme (28) > View and edit ... (2) > PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (9) > pbkdf2-iterations (2)
		We see option "Reset to the default value: 10000" so try it:
 
		The option was changed to "10000" (check in interactive):
 
		Change the property back to the value "10"
	
	


	Try equivalent non-interactive cmd


./bin/dsconfig set-password-storage-scheme-prop --scheme-name PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 --reset pbkdf2-iterations --hostname localhost --port 4444 --bindDn uid=admin --bindPassword password --trustAll --no-prompt





	
	
		Check the property value so we see that it is "10000"
	
	



I except that it should change it to new default value "10", not to old default value "10000".
