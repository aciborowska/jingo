Found using OpenDJ 6.0.0-SNAPSHOT rev bfceb6e10fe

Scenario
1. configure 2 DSRS servers with 7 entries
2. add/del rate of small entries on the first DSRS instance without limiting the throughput (doing around 11k/s)
3. let the test run for 12 hours
4. and we notice a divergence on the number of entries in the backend at the end of the test
=> the first instance contains 7 entries and the second instance 10650 entries
5. we also noticed the following error in the errors log for the first instance

However, if we limit the add/del throughput to be lower than the changenumber indexer throughput there is no divergence at the end of the test.
In this specific case/run the changenumber indexer throughput was around 9k/s.
