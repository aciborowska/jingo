Found with 7.0.0-SNAPSHOT rev. 34ba032f063894183622f87a0074d122af9bbb3b.

I discovered that it is not possible to disable generation of user entries like it is said in setup interactive.


The interactive setup says:

Configure server for profile 'DS evaluation'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Import generated user entries (uid=user.0, uid=user.1, uid=user.2 and so on)?
Generated user entries are a good fit for performance testing with tools like
addrate and searchrate.Enter 0 to disable import of generated entries. 
Number of generated users to import [100000]: 0

Doing that I hit an issue once finishing the interactive setup:

operation.
Please report this error and provide the log file mentioned above.      

The same can be reproduced in non-interactive setup with following command:

/path/to/opendj/setup \
          --serverId ds2 \
          --deploymentKeyPassword password \
          --rootUserDn uid=admin \
          --rootUserPassword password \
          --hostname pyforge.example.com \
          --adminConnectorPort 5444 \
          --ldapPort 2389 \
          --enableStartTls \
          --ldapsPort 2636 \
          --httpsPort 9443 \
          --replicationPort 9989 \
          --profile ds-evaluation \
          --set ds-evaluation/generatedUsers:0

Looks like the edge case is not covered in this profile. When 0 is set it doesn't create the ldif and following import fails. I would expect that this is covered in the profile or the value is forced to be 1 or greater.
