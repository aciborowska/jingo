When running the Azure AD with Powershell Connector sample it was discovered that the MSOnline module used by the scripts are deprecated and unsigned by Microsoft.

The install link in the documentation https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100) has many warnings about deprecation and the install link form that page https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/collaborate/connect-redirect?DownloadID=59185 states that Microsoft Connect has been retired.

Error encountered when trying to use the module and having to set unrestricted execution:

Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help
 topic at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
