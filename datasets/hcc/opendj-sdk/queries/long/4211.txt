OpenAM requires a persistent search against OpenDJ for several critical operations.

If you runÂ dsreplication --initialize-all (to correct problems) on a replica, then any p-searches against that replica are not closed properly. This means that the client running the p-search will not get notifications of changes on the p-search.

In the case of OpenAM, this can mean that OpenAM instances...

	...are not notified when new tokens are written to the CTS
	...are not notified when configuration is changed
	...are not notified when identities are modified in any way.



As OpenAM has caches for all of the above, it can result in an OpenAM instance running with out of date information in production.

I recommend closing p-searches before unsafe operations take place.
