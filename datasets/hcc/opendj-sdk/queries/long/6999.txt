Found in daily. OpenDJ 7.0.0-SNAPSHOT (e041bae9568)
In the suite we use two djs - DS and a client, in each test we setup them with different TLS versions.
tests are failing after the ldapsearch in the end of the test with:
 ERROR:


-- rc --
returned 255, expected to be in [0]
-- stdout --
-- stderr --
TLSv1.2 was unexpected at this time


To reproduce run:


./run-pybot.py -v -s security_group.TLSv3 dj
