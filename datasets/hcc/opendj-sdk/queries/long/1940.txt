sberthol@brie:bin$ ./dsconfig


>>>> Specify OpenDJ LDAP connection parameters

Directory server hostname or IP address [Unknown
(java.net.UnknownHostException: brie: brie: unknown error)]: brie.internal.forgerock.com

Directory server administration port number [4444]:

Password for user 'cn=Directory Manager':
