This is causing the upgrade tool to lose ds-cfg-character-set values.

The <cn=Character Set,cn=Password Validators,cn=config> entry in 2.5.0-Xpress1 (and earlier) has a ds-cfg-character-set attribute with 4 values by default:


ds-cfg-character-set: 1:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ds-cfg-character-set: 1:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
ds-cfg-character-set: 1:0123456789
ds-cfg-character-set: 1:~!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:,.<>/?



Note that two values differ only in case. When you upgrade to 2.6.0, one of those two values disappears, resulting in a slightly different configuration.

The attribute is defined as a directory string but with case sensitive matching.

Initial investigation shows that the LDIFEntryReader object is returning an entry with only 3 ds-cfg-character-set values.
