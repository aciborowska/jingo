Violette noticed that I'd included the wrong schema definitions in http://opendj.forgerock.org/doc/admin-guide/index.html#collective-attributes

My quotas.ldif wasn't the correct version. Looks like it was some sort of intermediate cleanup of my in progress mess. 

In comments at the top of Example.ldif is the correct version that should be in the docs.
