Scenario to reproduce:

	Setup an opendj instance, start the server, launch control-panel
	Go to Shema -> Manage Schema...
	Try to filter some elements by name with the filter "ds-cfg-*"



We expect to get all server configuration schema elements but we only have a "No Matches Found" message.
Note that this bug looks filter kind (Name, Type, Superior Class...) or search pattern (with or without wildcards...) independent.
