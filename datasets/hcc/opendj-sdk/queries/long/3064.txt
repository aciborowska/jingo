Found with OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev 27d6fa4d5acd2cb46d620876f65a6633b82c6be8

In our replication tests, we have a test suite around schema.
This suite sets up 2 servers, one with data, then we enable replication and initialize all.

One test adds a new objectclass and a user using this freshly created objectclass.
It then deletes the object class, and the user that has been created previously with this objectclass.

We have an error in errors log of both servers:

/tmp/replication_group/Schema/DJ1/opendj/logs$ grep -i error *

The index seems to be corrupt and is now operating in a degraded state. The index must be rebuilt before it can return to normal operation



This is a new error.

Script in attachment to reproduce it.
