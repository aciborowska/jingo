1. Do we have to provide legal-notices in the DS-cddl-sources-5.5.0-RC2.zip archive?
2. As all the archives for DJ (zip, dsml war,...) are built from the same repo, the copyrights files should be the same for all the archives no?
3. In the eval version we have an extra jar for Call Home ("opendj-backstage-connect-plugin-5.5.0-RC2.jar") we should also mention it in the copyrights file right?
