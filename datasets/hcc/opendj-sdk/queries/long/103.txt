Replication on the 2.4 branch and trunk is no longer compatible with 2.4.0 and 2.4.1.

The problem was introduced in an earlier change which improved the shutdown of TLSSocketSessions so that the SSL session would be terminated gracefully. However, graceful termination causes additional network traffic which then confuses the 2.4.0/1 peer which is not prepared for it.
