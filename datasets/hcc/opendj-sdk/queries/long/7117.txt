Our tools such as ldapsearch support a generic way of providing controls with the -J flag i.e. -J name:criticality:value See com.forgerock.opendj.ldap.tools.Utils#getControl()

However the approach to encoding the value part is generic and simplistic: any text in the value is just converted to UTF-8 and encoded as an OCTET STRING. That doesn't work for the ProxiedAuthV1 control, as its controlValue is explicitly wrapped in a SEQUENCE, viz



   proxyAuthValue::= SEQUENCE {
           proxyDN LDAPDN
   }



In other words, in order to pass any useful value to this control you have to encode it as BER, base64 encode that, and use -J name:criticality::base64 to pass that value.

This limits the usability of this particular control.

In our test case we were trying to pass an empty DN, which we ended up having to write as -J ProxiedAuthV1:true::MAIEAA== Trying to pass other DNs is even more awkward.
