When opening a backup or restore window from the control panel (respectively Directory Data -> Backup... and Directory Data -> Restore...), we got the same error panel in the window:


Note that the error message is printed every time we open a new Backup window and only the first time we open a Restore window.
In both window the error message is removed after a refresh time laps < 20sec (see OPENDJ-1960)
