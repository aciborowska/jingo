How to reproduce.

Setup OpenDJ with 20 generated entries.
Add a subEntry. In our case, we added a Collective Attribute entry.

dn: cn=Priv For Admins,dc=example,dc=com
cn: Priv For Admins
objectClass: extensibleObject
objectClass: collectiveAttributeSubentry
objectClass: top
objectClass: subentry
structuralObjectClass: subentry
ds-privilege-name;collective: password-reset
subtreeSpecification: 
{base "ou=people", specificationFilter "(isMemberOf=cn=Adm
 in,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com)"}

Now add new entries to the server.

Do a search with filter (|(objectclass=*)(objectclass=SubEntry))
Only the entries added up to the Subentry are returned.

Looking at the code, there's a bug in the code checking to return entry, which evaluated the present of ldapSubEntry in the filter as presence of the SubEntry control.
