Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev 5e9caa5055a

Some of the CAUD handlers depend on external jar files like the JDBC one which depends on database specific connector jar files (mysql-connector-java-5.1.34.zip for instance for MySQL).

Currently there is no clean way to add these jar files to the OpenDJ classpath:

	the jars placed under lib/extensions (not extension "format") and lib (only bootstrap.jar is added) folders are not added to the classpath
	so the only solution is to unpack these jar files to the classes folder
We should provide a clean mechanism to load/add to classpath this kind of jar files.
