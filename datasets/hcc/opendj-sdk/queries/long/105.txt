The changes introduced in 2.4.2 mean that we send a StopMsg whenever we close a replication session. While this is always handled correctly by the peer, it is not expected while performing a handshake (in other words 2.4.2 introduces a minor change to the protocol) and results in the above error message (there's similar one while getting the topology).

We could back out the changes which cause a StopMsg to always be sent on session termination, however I believe that the new design is cleaner and more robust against bugs:


	there is less code duplication: the logic which sends a StopMsg is in one place only
	less risk that a developer forgets to add code which sends a StopMsg



Since the error message is benign and the StopMsg is handled safely even if it is unexpected, I think we should keep the change and just trap the StopMsg during handshake.

From an interoperability point of view, 2.4.0 / 2.4.1 instances will potentially report the error message but will continue to behave correctly.
