When a new connection handler is added to a Directory server, it is:

	Initialized
	Added to the list of elements to be monitored by the health-checker
	Started, its listen addresses are resolved and it starts listening for requests
	Added to the list of connection handler in the config manager



If the connection handler fails to start, for example, because its listen addresses cannot be resolved, the connection handler is:

	Initialized
	Added to the list of elements to be monitored by the health-checker
	started (fails)



In this case, the connection handler is never removed from the list of elements to be monitored by the health-checker. Despite not being active (the configuration add operation have failed) it is still in memory and its health will still be reported by the health-checker. Only a server restart can fix the problem.
