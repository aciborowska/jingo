During upgrading from OpenDJ 2.6.3 to OpenDJ 3.0.0, I noticed that the path to the upgrade.log at the end of upgrade process points to instance path (not correct), but the log file is put in instance_path/logs folder (which is correct from my point of view). 

The log file is correctly placed to the instance_path/logs instead of install_path/logs, but the message should also points to the right place (same where the log is generated).
