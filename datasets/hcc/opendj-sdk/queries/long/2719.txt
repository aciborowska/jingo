It is impossible to add an entry larger than 4MB to a PDB backend. For example, adding a static group of 150k members results in this error from ldapmodify:


Processing ADD request for cn=Large Group,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
ADD operation failed
Result Code: 80 (Other)
Additional Information: Unchecked exception during database transaction: Requested size=8298822 exceeds maximum size=4194304



Attempting to add the same entry to a JE backend succeeds.

NB: the LDAP connection handler being used in both cases had its max-request-size property increased to 10mb.
