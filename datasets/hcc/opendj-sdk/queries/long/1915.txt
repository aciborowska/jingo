From the HttpServlet JavaDoc:

Servlets typically run on multithreaded servers, so be aware that a servlet must handle concurrent requests and be careful to synchronize access to shared resources. Shared resources include in-memory data such as instance or class variables and external objects such as files, database connections, and network connections. See the Java Tutorial on Multithreaded Programming for more information on handling multiple threads in a Java program.

Looking at the DSMLServlet it appears that there are several fields in the class, however most of them are either thread-safe or just simply only initialized in the init() method (which is only invoked exactly once per servlet object). The few exceptions that aren't thread-safe:


	documentBuilder instance -> this one is only used for newDocument invocations which looks to be thread-safe, but DocumentBuilders in general aren't thread-safe.
	messageFactory instance -> several SOF posts say that it's not documented to be thread-safe, hence the assumption should be that it isn't.
	proxyAuthzControl -> this one is really not thread-safe, the value assignment is done within doPost and then the value is read in performLDAPRequest,
