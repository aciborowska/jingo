Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev a50f5f780e7

After applied workaround for issues OPENDJ-3516, OPENDJ-3517 and OPENDJ-3518, I tried to create a JDBC audit handler and I got the following error:

$ opendj/bin/dsconfig -h localhost -p 4446 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X create-log-publisher --publisher-name "JDBC Access Log Publisher" --type external-access --set enabled:true --set config-file:/tmp/jdbc-handler-config.json -n	
-- rc --
returned 1, expected 0
-- stdout --

-- stderr --

The External Access Log Publisher could not be created due to a communications
problem: Other: The attempt to apply the configuration add failed. The
preliminary checks were all successful and the entry was added to the server
configuration, but at least one of the configuration add listeners reported an
error when attempting to apply the change: Error while creating or updating
common audit log publisher cn=JDBC Access Log Publisher,cn=Loggers,cn=config:
com.zaxxer.hikari.pool.HikariPool$PoolInitializationException: Failed to
initialize pool: Communications link failure

The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. The
driver has not received any packets from the server.
