This patch removes some logic where the  mustChangePassword function was checking the password policy state and making-up the state of the user's "must change password"-ness instead of just returning the state of the user's account. The presence of this logic prevented a user from being in the "must change password" state even when they should be in the "must change password" state depending on the complex intersection of some password policy configuration.

It should be possible for a user to be in the "must change password" state independent of their psssword policy. For example, maybe we want to reset a user's password and then force that user to use an administrative interface (like psync) to change their password away from the "must change password" state, while specifically disallowing that user from changing their own password.
