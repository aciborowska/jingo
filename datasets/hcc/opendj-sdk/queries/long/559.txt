The UTCTime syntax has a 2-digit field for the year, which creates parsing ambiguities.

X.509 (2008) and RFC 3280 both resolve this by specifying that digits 00-49 represent 2000-2049 and digits 50-99 represent 1950-1999.

The default SimpleDateFormatter seems to parse 00-31 as 2000-2031, and 32-99 as 1932-1999. I'm not sure what's special about 1932.
