Uses of check_expected_regex_matches_output in the doc non regression tests probably match too much.

Otherwise OPENDJ-5975 would've been caught when the code changed.

It's not clear that there's anything wrong with this bash function itself, as it only does what is advertised. It is, however, quite heavily used in the non-reg tests:

$ grep -R check_expected_regex_matches_output . | wc -l
456


So there might well be other errors if the pattern for setting up regular expressions was too lenient, and now gets fixed.
