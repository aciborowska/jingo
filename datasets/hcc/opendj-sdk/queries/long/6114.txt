The doc about REST to LDAP mapping configuration, https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/ds/rest-guide/index.html#mappings-json, does not specify that REST to LDAP resource type names, e.g. frapi:opendj:rest2ldap:user:1.0, can only be reused when they refer to the same resource type definition.

When the same names is used with different definitions, REST to LDAP can misbehave in different ways. For example, if the mappings are in separate file system directories, the configuration can fail to build the OpenAPI spec description of the APIs. The message logged does not point to the cause in any obvious way:
