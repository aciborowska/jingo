Found with OpenDJ 3.0.0 rev b788d2300f238000fd39ca6f0cc4b24ac211157a

We install and setup a server with some self-generated entries.

When checking the Monitoring > General Information > Database environment screen in the control-panel, we have noticed that nothing is displayed apart from the following message:


	No Database Environment Data Found -



This is also the case in 2.8.0.
