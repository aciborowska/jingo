Found using OpenDJ 2.8.0 (revision 12540).

Scenario:
************
1. install a server
2. stop the server
3. copy the binaries for the new version
4. run upgrade tool

$ .\opendj\upgrade.bat -n
...
Removing file  C:\\\opendj\\lib\\je.jar'     FAIL
...
$ echo $?



First the upgrade should exit with rc=1.

In the upgrade log we have:
[22/Jun/2015:06:48:43 +0100] category=UPGRADE sq=96 severity=SEVERE src=org.forgerock.i18n.slf4j.LocalizedLogger error msg=An error occurred while deleting file 'C:\\opendj\lib\je.jar'. Check that you have the rights to delete this file and that there is no other application using it
