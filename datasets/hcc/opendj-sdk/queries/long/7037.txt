This test tries to reproduce OPENDJ-4598:
In this test we use 3 instances of OpenDJ: DJ1, DJ2 and DJ3 after they are setup

	replication is configured and initialized between them like this:
DJ1-DJ2
DJ1-DJ3
	Then we run modrate
	uncofigure replication



This is run in a loop 10 times

Test fails in the end when it checks log files of DJ3
