Revision 58a67b030b23a4c49e73eccb40c488f13e0f8339 changed the alias of the SSL from ssl-cert to opendj-ssl because it was found that DJ was failing to find the SSL cert with alias ssl-cert when deployed as part of forgeops.

Considering that the Docker image actually includes an SSL cert with the correct alias, it would have been better to investigate why the forgeops deployed DJ was not using it. It looks like forgeops is still using hard-coded SSL keys published in a Git repo and using these to replace the keys provided by the Docker image. See https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgeops/tree/master/helm/ds/secrets

There also seems to be a script that's generating some certs, but it's unclear at first glance how it interacts with the files in helm/ds/secrets. See https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgeops/blob/master/helm/ds/cfssl.sh
