Testing with todays' nightly build, when running setup, I can see new WARNING messages that are duplicated and can be confusing:


[20/Apr/2015:16:54:03 +0200] category=UTIL severity=WARNING msgID=org.opends.messages.extension.636 msg=The EC_EC key with alias 'admin-cert' was not found for 'Administration Connector'
[20/Apr/2015:16:54:44 +0200] category=UTIL severity=WARNING msgID=org.opends.messages.extension.636 msg=The EC_EC key with alias 'admin-cert' was not found for 'Administration Connector'


These messages are no longer showing up after stop and start of the server.
