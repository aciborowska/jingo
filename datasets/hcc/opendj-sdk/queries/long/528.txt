After upgrading a database from OpenDS 2.2, customer discovered that specific subtree searches were not returning any entry, while a top search or the same filter down the subtree would match and return 2 entries.
As all indexes had been rebuilt, and searches done as directory manager, we ruled out some ACI or DIT issue.
After exporting the data and reimporting it, the issue was no longer exercised.

The search turned out to be a complete unindexed one (filter on unindexed attribute, and subtree scope showed that the number of children entries was also exceeding index limits).
In that case, the server scopes search candidates using the DN2ID system index, iterating through a range of keys.

Examination of the defective DN2ID index showed that the order was based on the OpenDS 2.2 algorithm, even after a rebuild of the index.
Looking at the code, it appears that the index is not deleted and recreated, but truncated, and therefore the sorting comparator is not updated to the latest version.
