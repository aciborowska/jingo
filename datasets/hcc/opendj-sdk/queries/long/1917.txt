	Problem:
	
		User can search without previous set of his password while the force-change-on-reset is enabled.
	
	
	Prerequisite:
	
		OpenDJ 3.0.0 deployed.
		Property force-change-on-reset enabled
		Reset user's password with admin account.
	
	
	Steps to reproduce:
	
		Provide basic ldapsearch with password used with ldappassword command from prerequisite.
	
	



I have attached script to quickly reproduce the problem.  

	Download
	Put into "XY" directory
	Copy OpenDJ-3.0.0.zip to "XY" directory
	From "XY" directory run ./reproduce.sh
