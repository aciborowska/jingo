Chapter â†ª 5.4. Configuring Access Control (http://docs.forgerock.org/en/opendj/2.6.0/admin-guide/index/chap-privileges-acis.html#configure-acis) 

1. This section gives an explanation for the Global ACI's but does not reference the actual ACI's themselves.  This can confuse admins as they try to understand which ACI's they can either change or eliminate.

Default global ACIs set up the following access rules.

	Users can employ LDAP controls and perform extended operations.
	Anonymous read access is allowed for most user data attributes.
	Users can read password values on their own entries after binding. (Also by default, password values are hashed.)
	Anonymous read access is allowed for schema-related operational attributes.
	Anonymous read access is allowed for root DSE attributes describing what the server supports.
	Anonymous read access is allowed for operational attributes related to entry updates and entry identification.
	Access to replication data is denied.



The above should include the ACI's for comparison.

2. The above list only shows 7 of the 10 actual ds-cfg-global-aci included with a default config.ldif.
