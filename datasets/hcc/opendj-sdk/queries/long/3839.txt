Mark found out that If an EL expression is used incorrectly, starting a server may print a message like:

 Directory Server: An unexpected error occurred while attempting to process the Directory Server configuration file /Users/fabiop/scratch/opendj/ssl/opendj/config/config.ldif: null



that is not very helpful. Nothing else is logged, since the server is still reading the configuration file
