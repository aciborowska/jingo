I installed a fresh copy of 2.6 on Windows.

    Told setup.bat to run as a windows service
    Launched control-panel at the end of setup.bat using the link provided

I was able to stop and start the service from that control-panel launched after setup. As soon as I close that control-panel however, and launch a new control-panel.bat, it is unable to start or stop the service.

It gives an error:

An error occurred starting the server. Error code: 255
Equivalent command line:
C:\Users\Matt\Desktop\OpenDJ-2.6.0\opendj\bat\start-ds.bat "--timeout" "0"

\Java\jdk1.7.0\bin\java.exe\logs\ was unexpected at this time.

The same error is displayed for stopping the server from control-panel

Equivalent command line:
C:\Users\Matt\Desktop\OpenDJ-2.6.0\opendj\bat\stop-ds.bat

\Java\jdk1.7.0_51\bin\java.exe\logs\ was unexpected at this time.

Even when running the control-panel.bat with "Run As Administrator" this problem seems to still exist.

when I change start-ds.bat to show all the commands (take out echo off), I saw that it was messing up on the line

set TEMP_LOG=%TEMP%\logs\

I added a line above that in my start and stop scripts just to see if it would work:
set TEMP=%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp

And it did. I can now stop and start the server from the console by setting %TEMP% to a good value. It seems like before it was setting %TEMP% to \Java\jdk1.7.0\bin\java.exe

And I don't know why because my Environment Variables have TEMP set for User and System level â€“ to a directory (Not anything to do with Java or Java.exe).

From the command prompt in Windows , echo %TEMP% gives the correct value of some path to \temp\ , however from inside the control-panel %TEMP% evaluates to the java.exe
