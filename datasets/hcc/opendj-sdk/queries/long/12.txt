Discussed on #opends IRC channel, the customer found that dsreplication disable was failing with error 53.

UNEXPECTED'.  Details: javax.naming.OperationNotSupportedException: [LDAP: error code 53 - You must change your password before you will be allowed to perform any other operations]; remaining name 'cn=hostname.removed.com:4444,cn=Servers,cn=admin data'

This indicates that Password Change on Reset or Password Change on Add was enabled.
Looking at the cn=admin entry in the "Admin Data" backend it turns out, there is no specified password policy for the administrative account which then falls into the default password policy like all other users.
