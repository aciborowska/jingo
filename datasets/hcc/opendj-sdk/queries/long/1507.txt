The two diagrams (repl-topologies-right.png and repl-topologies-wrong.png) are continuing to cause confusion.

In the second "wrong" diagram, the big no-entry sign obscures the diagram a bit too much, especially as it is a black shape on top of other black shapes. More colour would help here perhaps. The other problem with this diagram is that it is quite hard to see what's not allowed, so perhaps the two different dc=example,dc=org suffixes need to be distinguished more.

In both diagrams I think it would be helpful if we clearly indicated the triangles were all DSes, and we drew in separate RS servers. Indicating A & B were in a separate datacentre from C & D might also help, so we can see that RSes in each DC do contain all the suffixes.
