If you temporarily disable replication using procedure 9.4 at http://opendj.forgerock.org/doc/admin-guide/index.html#stop-repl and then run "dsreplication status", the server is still listed as enabled.

The server does not get updates (so it really is disabled) but it is hard to reliably discern that from dsreplication status. One possible indicator is that the missing changes value is empty for temporarily disabled servers.
