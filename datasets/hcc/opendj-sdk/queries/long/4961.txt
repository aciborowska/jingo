Found using OpenDJ 6.0.0 M120.4

Scenario
1. install a server
2. enable SNMP connection handler
(set the opendmk-jarfile property to the path to your jdmkrt.jar file for instance /tmp/jdmkrt.jar)
3. upgrade the instance
4. as part of the upgrade task for OPENDJ-4353 the opendmk-jarfile property should be removed from the SNMP connection handler and the jdmkrt.jar file should be copied under the extlib folder
==> after the upgrade the jdmkrt.jar is not copied under extlib and as a consequence the SNMP connection handler is not operational

To reproduce the issue:

$ ./run-pybot.py -s upgrade_group.upgrade_tasks DJ
