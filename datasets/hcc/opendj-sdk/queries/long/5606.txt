When upgrading to DS 6.0.0, it was seen that the process fails while trying to move admin-backend.ldif from /path/to/DS/config/ to /path/to/DS/db/admin, if these two locations are on different filesystems.

According to the Javadocs for the file.renameTo() method:
The rename operation might not be able to move a file from one filesystem to another, it might not be atomic, and it might not succeed if a file with the destination abstract pathname already exists.
This may affect other files being renamed as well.
