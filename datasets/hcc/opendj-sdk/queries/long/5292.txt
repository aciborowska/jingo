When running dsconfig in offline interactive mode, apparently there is no way to edit the replication domain or replication server to replace values with configuration expressions. Instead, dsconfig ends with null after you select an option.

In the following examples, I've set up two servers with a single base DN entry for dc=example,dc=com, configured replication, and stopped the servers:

>>>> Replication Domain management menu

What would you like to do?

    1)  Create a new Replication Domain
    2)  View and edit an existing Replication Domain
    3)  Delete an existing Replication Domain
    4)  List existing Replication Domains

    a)  show advanced components and properties
    q)  quit
    b)  back

Enter choice [b]: 4


>>>> There is only one Replication Synchronization Provider: "Multimaster
Synchronization". Are you sure that this is the correct one? (yes / no) [yes]: 
null


Also:

>>>> Replication Server management menu

What would you like to do?

    1)  Create a new Replication Server
    2)  View and edit the Replication Server
    3)  Delete an existing Replication Server
    4)  Show the Replication Server

    a)  show advanced components and properties
    q)  quit
    b)  back

Enter choice [b]: 2


>>>> There is only one Replication Synchronization Provider: "Multimaster
Synchronization". Are you sure that this is the correct one? (yes / no) [yes]: 
null


In both cases, the command exits after displaying null.
