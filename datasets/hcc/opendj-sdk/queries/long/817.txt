As Dave Koelmeyer observes:


The user FAQ at 
https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/OPENDJ/OpenDJ+User+FAQ 
refers to http://forgerock.org/opendj.html for the latest stable 
version, and I see this page has been partitioned into Enterprise 
downloads (presumably bound by the license you've mentioned) and an 
"Archive of stable community releases".

Following the change to the license for Enterprise products, that page should probably either refer to the forgerock.com site for everything about licensing, or just avoid discussing the topic.
