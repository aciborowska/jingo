On Windows during setup the Runtime Options, Java Runtime Setting proposes in "Other Java Arguments" '-server' argument, which after selecting OK, the Checking Data will fail on Windows as '-server' argument is not supported by Java on Windows.

Message:
Could not use the arguments '-server' using the running Java virtual machine. Check that the Java virtual machine supports this argument.

Workaround is to remove -server argument.
