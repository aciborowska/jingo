Found using revision 11742.

The product name has changed from 'OpenDJ' to 'OpenDJ Directory Server'.

After this change, I tried to use control-panel from previous version (like 2.6.0) to connect to a 3.0.0 server and I got the following error:
"The remote serfver in 'localhost' is cannot be managed by this control panel. The remote server product name is 'OpenDJ Directory Server' and the control panel product name is 'OpenDJ'"

This change also impact the following commands:

$ ./bin/start-ds -F
OpenDJ Directory Server 3.0.0
...




$ ./bin/start-ds
