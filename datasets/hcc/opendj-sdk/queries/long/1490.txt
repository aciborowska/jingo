I upgraded a replication topology and when I tried to restart the servers, the servers fail to start with the following error:


[05/Jun/2014:14:37:48 +0200] category=CORE severity=NOTICE msgID=458891 msg=The Directory Server has sent an alert notification generated by class org.opends.server.core.DirectoryServer (alert type org.opends.server.DirectoryServerShutdown, alert ID 458893):  The Directory Server has started the shutdown process.

The ReplicationBackend class has been removed as part of fix for OPENDJ-1454.
So we should add a task in the upgrade to remove references to this class.
