Since OpenDJ code base uses more and more the SDK connection / connection factories, there is a lot more use of CLIENT_SIDE_* result codes.

The RFC is very clear that "This is for client-side use only and should never be transferred over protocol.".

A RequestFilter should be added in OpenDJ to convert such CLIENT_SIDE_* result codes into result codes that can be transferred over the protocol.
