Since the compact encoding of the file-replica-db, these ones does not contains the replica-id nor the base-dn anymore.
Because of that, the ouput produced by dump-replica-db-file is incomplete (replica-id is set to -1 while the base-dn is simply not displayed)
To help people read these output we propose to add --replica-id and --base-dn arguments which will be used as value for the replica and base-dn so that the output looks consistent.

These options should be optional and the options used to generate the dump must be part of the dump itself. The reason is that since these arguments cannot be validated, the reader of the dump must known which options have been used to produce it.
