To reproduce:

1) Install two 3.5.0 servers with replication
2) Make sure the global admin password is different to the Directory Manager password
3) Attempt to use dsreplication status

Result:

dsreplication status will attempt to bind with Directory Manager instead of the admin user. This fails and the command gives up. It does not seem possible to run the command successfully. Using the Directory Manager password still fails, as it will attempt to then bind as the admin user. 

Changing the passwords so they match can be used as a workaround.
