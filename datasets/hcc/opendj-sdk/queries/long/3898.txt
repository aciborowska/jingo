Found with opendj 4.0.0 rev 75ee4635651742521e7f21e9ed0b8b26b4cd1e20

We unzip the opendj archive.
From the opendj directory, we use the setup tool once in interactive mode, to install the directory server with default values.

Then we run the setup tool in interactive mode again.
It prompts for the license, asks for directory server or proxy server installation, we choose directory server again.

We enter a new instance path, it creates an instance.loc file with this new path, the  proceed with questions and finally install a second server this way.

We can do that a third time but the instance.loc being already created, it does not overwrite it and when trying to start the server, it claims it's already started.

The setup tool should be more robust and prevents the user to run the setup tool multiple times from the same place to avoid any confusion.
