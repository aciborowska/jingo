Found using OpenDJ 3.0.0 and pluggable backends.

Scenario:
***********

	install a server with some automatically-generated data and pdb backend for instance (same with JE pluggable)

$ ./opendj/setup -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w password --adminConnectorPort 4444 --ldapsPort 1636 --generateSelfSignedCertificate -b dc=com -t pdb  -d 10 --cli -n


	try to rename entry "user.0" to "User.0"

$ ./opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w password
dn: uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=com
changetype: modrdn
newrdn: uid=User.0
deleteoldrdn: 1

-- rc --
returned 68, expected 0
-- stdout --
Processing MODIFY DN request for uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=com

-- stderr --
MODIFY DN operation failed
Result Code:  68 (Entry Already Exists)
Additional Information:  The entry cannot be renamed to 'uid=User.0,ou=people,dc=com' because an entry with that name already exists





The operation works fine with local-db backend.

NOTE: same problem when doing subtree move (newsuperior)
