When running the setup in non-interactive mode (setup -n), the license is automatically accepted and in that case the file Legal/licenseAccepted is not created (this file is an empty file to indicate that the license has been accepted).

From my point of view the setup tool should not accept automatically the license (this needs a user interaction).
And we should add a new option to the setup tool (for instance --acceptLicense) to explicitly accept the license (useful for scripting).
