The schema definition of the ChangeLogEntry objectclass contains attributes that are operational attributes.

Operational attributes shouldn't be part of objectclass definitions, as they are not tied to specific objectclasses, and they must be requested specifically (by name or by '+' ).

Further more, the definition of the ChangelogEntry objectclass with these attributes is not matching the one defined in the IETF internet-draft for the changelog.
