Added an fr-idm-uuid index in order to improve very poor observed performance with AM 7.0 using the DS idrepo profile.  The fr-idm-uuid attribute is showing up in unindexed searches. It effectively hangs AM when viewing the Identities UI.

However- it is not 100% clear if AM should in fact be using this attribute to search for users. Yannick Lecaillez is investigating.

Note that in order to get the unit test to pass, the index needed to be added to both the 7.0 and 6.5 IDM profiles (a demonstration profile used only for development, and not supported in production) 

Possible outcomes:

	The 6.5 IDM profile should be removed in 7.x, as it is not supported in production (customers should use the 7.x profile)
	The unit tests should be split up into one for 6.5, one for 7.x (currently the same unit test is used for both).
	The unit test should tolerate additional indexes being present.
	The fr-idm-uuid attribute can be added to the IDM 6.5 schema (it wont be used).
	AM is modified to not require this attribute, and it can be removed from both the 6.5 and 7.0 profiles, and the unit tests.
