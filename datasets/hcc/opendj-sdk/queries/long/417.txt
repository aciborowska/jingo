LDAPListenerOptions only provides the ability to change the SSLContext but not the ciphers, protocols, or client auth settings. In addition, the Javadoc indicates that the settings apply to SSL and StartTLS, but in fact they are only used for SSL. Finally, the functionality provided by these settings is duplicated by the LDAPClientContext.startTLS method, which ignores any settings in the LDAPListenerOptions.
