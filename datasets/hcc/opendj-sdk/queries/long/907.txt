Found using revision 8859.

Currently the lib/set-java-home file is not updated/re-generated by the upgrade tool. 

This file has been updated in OpenDJ-2.5.0 to use OPENDJ_JAVA_* variables instead of OPENDS_JAVA_*

Moreover if a tool is added in the new version (OpenDJ-2.5.0) and/or the default values for JAVA_ARGS have changed, these changes will not be available after the upgrade.

=> it could be fine to re-generate this file during the upgrade process
