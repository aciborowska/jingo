Found using OPENDJ-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT (rev number d4262475f3e099e1023ba0e8c9ba53782268f52a)

Step to follow to reproduce:


	$ bin/dsconfig
	Select 20)  HTTP Endpoint
	Select 2)  Create a new HTTP Endpoint
	Select 3)  Rest2ldap Endpoint
	Enter a test name for the new endpoint (e.g rest2ldap-test)
	Select 7)  Create a new HTTP Authorization Mechanism
	Select 2)  HTTP Basic Authorization Mechanism
	Enter a test name for the new authorization mechanism (e.g http-basic-authz-test)
	Select 1)  true to enabled the authorization mechanism by default
	Select 1)  Exact Match as identity mapper
	Hit enter to f)  finish - create the new http-basic-authz-test



Then the following error occurs:


The HTTP Basic Authorization Mechanism could not be created because of the
following reason:

    *  Unwilling to Perform: The Directory Server is unwilling to add
       configuration entry cn=http-basic-authz-test,cn=HTTP Authorization
       Mechanisms,cn=config because one of the add listeners registered with
       the parent entry cn=HTTP Authorization Mechanisms,cn=config rejected
       this change with the message: The value
       "org.opends.server.protocols.http.authz.HTTPBasicAuthorizationMechanism"
       is not a valid value for the "java-class" property, which must have the
       following syntax: CLASS <=
       org.opends.server.protocols.http.authz.HttpAuthorizationMechanism
