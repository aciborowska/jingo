Such logged messages are useless until we implement LdapClientImpl.toString():

WARNING: Connection factory 'CachedConnectionPool(size=0[in:0 + out:0 + pending:0], maxSize=17, blocked=0, ldapClient=org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.LdapClientImpl@36ab2aec)' is no longer operational: Connect Error: The connection attempt to server ctsstore-0/92.242.132.24:1389 has failed because the connection timeout period of 10000 ms was exceeded


I think this problem was introduced when Connections were switched to become LdapClients.
