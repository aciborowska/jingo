Steps to reproduce:

1) install opendj 3.0.0, with a split instance/install folder

2) configure SNMP, providing a customÂ opendmk-jarfile

3) extract archive of DS-6.0.0 into the install folder and run the upgrade tool

** An error occurred while copying OpenDMK jar file
'/home/viktor/repos/pyforge/PyBot/OpenDJ/testcases/data/upgrade_group/opendmk/lib/jdmkrt.jar'
to
'/home/viktor/repos/pyforge/results/20180430-141714/upgrade_group/UpgradeTasks/DJ_TASKS2/opendj/extlib/jdmkrt.jar':
/home/viktor/repos/pyforge/results/20180430-141714/upgrade_group/UpgradeTasks/DJ_TASKS2/opendj/extlib/jdmkrt.jar 

...

Current behavior:

The upgrade tool tries to copy the jdmkrt.jar into the install directory (.../DJ_TASKS2/opendj/extlib/) and fails to do so, as this directory does not exists

Expected behavior:

The tool should copy the jdmkrt.jar into the instance directory (.../DJ_TASKS2/instance/extlib/)

Script to reproduce:


OPENDJ_VERSION=6.0.0-final
OPENDJ_PREVIOUS_VERSION=3.0.0
OPENDJ_RELOC_INSTANCE=True
./run-pybot.py -s upgrade_group.UpgradeTasks -v -t pre_upgrade_snmp_java9 -t upgrade_tasks -t prost_upgrade_snmp_java9 DJ
