The OpenDJ documentation currently places explanations and procedures for directory servers and for proxy servers in the same documents.

This is not technically wrong. It could however lead readers to think it is okay to configure hybrid servers that both store local data and also forward requests. This is tempting because dsconfig will let you do it.

But hybrid configurations are not supported, partly because it is not currently possible to mix access control models. There are no doubt other problems as well.

So if we decide not to support hybrid servers longer term, the docs should be split apart.
