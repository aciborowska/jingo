Hi

I'm about to migrate from SUN Java Directory (with messaging servers) and struggling with all problems that is related to this. I have now successfully imported and modified all schemafiles needed so that the server starts without any errors at all. Thats fine.
Now I'm about to import data from our SUN Java server and get a lot of errors. One of them is the following.


	Entry uid=phz,ou=people,o=oru.se,dc=oru,dc=se read from LDIF starting at line 20243 is not valid because it violates the server's schema configuration:  Entry uid=phz,ou=people,o=oru.se,dc=oru,dc=se violates the Directory Server schema configuration because it includes multiple conflicting structural objectclasses oruPerson and pilotPerson.  Only a single structural objectclass is allowed in an entry



It seems to me that the OPENDJ-server is MUCH more strict then the SUN Java D.
As I understand, an entry must have only one structural objectclass. Typical entries for people are as follows.

objectclass			SUP
--------------------------------------------
top                              -
  person	                 top
    organizationalPerson         person
      inetorgperson              organizationalPerson
        oruPerson                inetorgperson
    pilotPerson                  person

I hope this looks OK after posting it.

All classes iherits from person but pilotPerson are in parallell with organizationalPerson. Is that the problem? I have tried to find the answer in my LDAP-book but I'm not sure what to think about this. If it's not allowed then it means you have to choose between organizationalPerson or pilotPerson and the underlaying classes that extends each of them?

Thanks in advance
