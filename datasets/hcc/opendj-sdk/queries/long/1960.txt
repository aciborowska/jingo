If a user edits an index or a VLV index, he could have a very bad experience if he does not click on 'save changes' button in the right time. It looks like the control panel refresh server informations (aka descriptors) every 20sec. The problem is that it refresh user modified elements as well. We need to 'lock' user modifications to prevent this really bad side effect.  

Note that this issue has been checked on the (VLV) indexes modification, but it is probably appear in other server element modification panels...
