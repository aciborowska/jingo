Found using version 4.1.0-SNAPSHOT (0335286f3731130d89e5f0c80dfcbd4ba841f8f0)
Steps to reproduce:

1. Launch interactive setup from a fresh opendj archive (./setup
2. Choose to setup a proxy server
3. Choose either SSL or StartTLS to secure connections between proxy and directory servers
4. Choose that the proxy should blindly trust remote server certificates
5. When the interactive mode should summarized how the remote server will be discovered, the following error occurs:


How should the proxy trust certificates from remote directory servers?

    1)  Use the JVM truststore
    2)  Use a PKCS#12 truststore
    3)  Use a JCEKS truststore
    4)  Use a JKS truststore
    5)  Blindly trust all certificates (evaluation only - unsafe for
        production)

Enter choice [1]: 5

An unexpected error has been raised during setup: 'Invalid trust method:
BLIND_TRUST'
See /tmp/opendj-setup-5252112818541052649.log for a detailed log of the failed
operation.\
Please report this error and provide the log file mentioned above.


Sample above is for a static list of server, if the replication discovery mechanism is chosen, some other questions will be prompted before that the error occurs.

In addition, if the replication is chosen as discovery mechanism, the way that the proxy should trust remote server certificates is always asked (because replication servers are always contacted on administration port which uses SSL) but is not summarized if the connections between proxy and remote servers does not have to be secured.
