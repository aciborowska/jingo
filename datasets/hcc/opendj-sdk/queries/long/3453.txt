When the server is in lockdown mode, an LDAP search from another host used to return 53. Now it returns 11:

With default (FQDN) hostname:


ldapsearch --port 56830 --baseDN "" --searchScope base "(objectclass=*)" +
The LDAP search request failed: 11 (Administrative Limit Exceeded)
Additional Information:  The attempt to register this connection with the
Directory Server was rejected. This might indicate that the server already has
the maximum allowed number of concurrent connections established, or that it
is in a restricted access mode



With localhost:


ldapsearch --hostname localhost --port 56830 --baseDN "" --searchScope base "(objectclass=*)" +
The LDAP search request failed: 53 (Unwilling to Perform)
Additional Information:  Rejecting the requested operation because the server
is in lockdown mode and will only accept requests from root users over
loopback connections



Perhaps we think that letting people know the server state is leaking information? IMO, it's just helpful and the current message is not helpful.
