A server has 5000 static groups. Many are nested. Some have 80k members.

Frequent modifications to the uniqueMember attribute of one standalone (not included in other groups) group are fast.

Retrieving isMemberOf information for users in these groups is also fast.

However the combination is very slow, and frequent updates to groups result in poor isMemberOf performance and high CPU usage. The server is observed to spend a lot of time in reloadIfNeeded().

Some comments in OPENDJ-1584 suggest ways to improve this, by using information available in the postModifyOperation plugin (i.e. the actual mods) to avoid updating the refreshToken.
