After enabling HTTP connection handler on OPenDJ 2.6.2, we try to generate some load with ab, using the keep-alive option '-k' (keep-alive is supposed to be enabled by default on the connection handler) with:
ab -k -n 100000 -c 100 -H "X-OpenIDM-Username: user.0" -H "X-OpenIDM-Password: password" "http://lab01-fr:10080/users/user.0"

However, using 'netstat -an', we clearly see that a new connection is opened for each operation (which is unexpected)
