While investigating OPENDJ-7236 I noticed that the SearchReactive sample attempts to close the client connection twice, each time attempting to send an UNBIND request. Firstly, I don't understand why it tries to send two requests. What's more puzzling is that neither request made it to the network! The Grizzly layer appears to write the message according to the debugging I did, but I couldn't see the LDAP messages using Wireshark.

It'd be nice to understand what's going on in case it points to a bug in our SDK.
