We have a test with a split DS RS topology.
It upgrades one server at a time (from 3.5.0 to 7.0.0) and checks the replication works fine.
When stopping a server, we sometimes get an error in another server of the topology:


20:38:36.504	INFO	--- Check for error patterns in "/home/jenkins/workspace/OpenDJ-build_master-CPMER56E632EMKNXZEURRUYWFHY72MGZDGZHN7BYLM5SGO6GS6PA/results/20200109-155054/replication_group3/Upgrade/DJ_REPL_DS2/opendj/logs/errors" file ---

To try and reproduce the issue:


./run-pybot.py -s replication_group3.Upgrade -t Replication_Topology_Split_DS_RS opendj
