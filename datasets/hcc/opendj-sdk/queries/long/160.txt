In opendj-project, opendj-docs is a module. In the site goal of opendj-docs, the current implementation copies the generated docs into a doc folder of the parent site.

mvn site-deploy seems to build the top-level site, deploy it, then build the child modules, and deploy them. Thus the top-level site is published before the doc folder is copied to the parent site.

The right way to avoid this issue is probably to keep docs under src of the parent, since docs tend to be transversal across the project anyway. Then the docs would be built before the parent site is deployed.
