Changing the 'mapped-search-bind-password' in LDAP PTA Policy configuration after an existing connection is made does not get picked up in the heart beat.

Connect to local ldap server with a user that has authn delegated to a remote-ldap-server.
./ldapsearch -p 1389 -D "cn=LDAP PTA User,ou=unit1,o=People,dc=Europe,dc=com" -w secret12 -b "cn=LDAP PTA User,ou=unit1,o=People,dc=Europe," "objectclass=*"
The simple bind attempt failed
Result Code:  49 (Invalid Credentials)

Then modify 'mapped-search-bind-password' in in LDAP PTA Policy configuration:

   5)   mapped-search-bind-password                       **********

Connect again:
./ldapsearch -p 1389 -D "cn=LDAP PTA User,ou=unit1,o=People,dc=Europe,dc=com" -w secret12 -b "cn=LDAP PTA User,ou=unit1,o=People,dc=Europe," "objectclass=*"
The simple bind attempt failed

Looking at the heartbeat connection every 5 seconds also is not being authenticated.

Snooping the LDAP traffic with Wireshark is showing that the bind is still using the old password credentials.

Restarting the local ldap server resolves this issue and confirm the issue.
