After creating a new DS instance, the control panel starts up but complains at the top of the main screen:


There should be no warnings on the schema, but instead got 1 warnings: Validation of matching rule definition ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.4.8.1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.3.6 NAME 'enumOrderingMatch.1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.3.6' SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.3.6 X-ORIGIN 'OpenDS Directory Server' ) failed and will be removed from the schema: The matching rule "enumOrderingMatch.1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.3.6" is associated with attribute syntax "1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.3.6" which is not defined in the schema



In addition when viewing entries in "LDIF" mode, all the attributes are in the top panel. I would normally expect a bunch of operational attributes (entryDN, entryUUID, etc) in the "Non-editable Attributes" panel.

The initial warning may have caused all the schema to get ignored.
