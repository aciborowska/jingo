I got the keys backwards in describing encryption of the shared symmetric key replicated around and used by the crypto manager. The docs say:


The symmetric key is encrypted in turn with the server's private key that is also stored with the server configuration (admin-keystore).

The symmetric key is encrypted with the public key for each server so that the server can decrypt it with its private key.
