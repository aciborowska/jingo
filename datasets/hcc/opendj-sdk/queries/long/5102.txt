With clean installation of 2 DSRS servers it's possible to see warning messages in start-ds output:


WARNING msgID=133 msg=Connected to a replication server with wrong group id. We have group id GroupId[default] and replication server id 8314 pyforge.example.com:8992 has group id GroupId[1]. This is for domain cn=schema in directory server 4459

To reproduce the issue:

	install 2 DSRS topology
	stop DS1
	stop DS2
	start DS1 



During point 4, it's possible to see above warning message.

The issue is also reproducible with functional tests:


./run-pybot.py -s replication_group1.basic -t Dsreplication_Status_No_Missing_Changes -v DJ
