When the asynchronous option is used within addrate, searchrate or modrate, tool does not work at all:

bin/searchrate -p 1389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w p -A -F -c 32 -t 4 -s base -d 80 -b "uid=user.%d,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" -g "rand(0,9)" "(objectclass=*)"
Result Code:  91 (Connect Error)
Additional Information:  The connection attempt to server
gaetan-laptop/127.0.0.1:1389 has failed because the connection timeout period
of 30000 ms was exceeded



Note that for addrate sometimes it seems to work until the purge phase.
Purge phase is then very long and it seems that everything is not purged in the server at the end of the addrate run.
