When requesting password modify extended operation via a proxy server, it fails with a strange error. 

Steps to reproduce:

1. Setup a simple PS/DS topology (cn=myself is the rootDN of DS, and the user PS uses for proxied-auth)

2. Send a ldappasswordmodify request


./bin/ldappasswordmodify -h localhost -p 1390 -D "cn=myself" -w password -a u:user.2 -c password -n newpassword


Current behavior:


The LDAP password modify operation failed: 123 (Authorization Denied) Additional Information: An error occurred while attempting to map authorization ID string "u:user.2" to a user entry: An internal failure occurred while attempting to resolve ID string user.2 to a user entry: User dn:cn=internal client,cn=root dns,cn=config specified in the proxied authorization V2 control does not exist in the Directory Server


Expected behavior:

It should find the user based on the uid, and change his password.
