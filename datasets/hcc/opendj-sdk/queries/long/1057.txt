http://opendj.forgerock.org/doc/admin-guide/index/dsconfig-1.html

subsection 'dsconfig Subcommands' states ...

    create-component

    list-components

    delete-component

    get-component-prop

    set-component-prop

http://opendj.forgerock.org/opendj-server/configref/ does not make obvious what 'component' mean.

One may deduce that 'component' mean e.g. 'Plugin'

dsconfig .... list-Plugins does not work as suggested by the doc ...

only

dsconfig ... list-plugins works...

How should one deduce the component name for 'Extended Operation Handler' or 'Administration Connector'?

of course one could use 'recording functionality' of 'dsconfig interactive mode' but IMHO it should be obvious by just reading the doc
