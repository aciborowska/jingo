Found with 6.0.0 rev 8223c75655e

We have a regression in our tests with ldapmodify.
We setup a server with some data.
We use ldapmodify with -f option with an ldif file containing wrong values for changetype or newrdn etc.
We expect to have a 89 return code but it returns 2:


./DJ1/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1390 -D "cn=myself" -w password /tmp/ldapmodify_changes.ldif
# The LDAP modify request failed: 2 (Protocol Error)
# Additional Information:  Unable to parse LDIF change record starting at line 1 with distinguished name "ou=nochangetype,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com" because there was no change type
