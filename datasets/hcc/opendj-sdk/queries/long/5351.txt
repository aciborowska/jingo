In the cloud, the preference for applications is to log to stdout and use dedicated tools for log collection like fluentd, logstash, splunk, rsyslog, etc.

When running OpenDJ in nodetach mode, OpenDJ writes stdout to the console, but it keeps writing to logs/server.out. , i.e. it writes to the container's file-system.

This is pointless since logging already goes to stdout.

 

Moreover, with OPENDJ-5344, this is even dangerous since it can quickly fill the disk (logs/server.out does not rotate and is flushed only on restart).

 

This issue can be closed once OpenDJ no longer writes to logs/server.out in nodetach mode.
