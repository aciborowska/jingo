--type is now needed to distinguish local password policies from pass through authentication policies.

This is reflected in the reference for dsconfig:


dsconfig create-password-policy

Creates Authentication Policies

--policy-name {name}

The name of the new Authentication Policy
--set {PROP:VALUE}

Assigns a value to a property where PROP is the name of the property and VALUE is the single value to be assigned. Specify the same property multiple times in order to assign more than one value to it
-t | --type {type}

The type of Authentication Policy which should be created. The value for TYPE can be one of: ldap-pass-through | password-policy



It should also be covered in the Admin Guide chapter on password policy, specifically Procedure 10.2. To Create a Server Based Password Policy.
