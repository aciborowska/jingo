When using the dsconfig, I probably used the wrong credential or port or what's ever. The interesting part is that the error message at the end is displaying the default port. 

The output of the dsconfiguration should be quite explicit:



Directory server administration port number [4444]: 5444



and the error:



Unable to connect to the server at "sandbox" on port 4444



The full output:


./dsconfig 


>>>> Specify OpenDJ LDAP connection parameters

Directory server hostname or IP address [sandbox]: 

Directory server administration port number [4444]: 5444

Administrator user bind DN [cn=Directory Manager]: 

Password for user 'cn=Directory Manager':

Do you trust this server certificate?

  1) No
  2) Yes, for this session only
  3) Yes, also add it to a truststore
  4) View certificate details

Enter choice: [2]: 

Unable to connect to the server at "sandbox" on port 4444




Note: dsconfig doesn't try to connect to 4444, as I would have a different error. It's really just the error message at the end.
