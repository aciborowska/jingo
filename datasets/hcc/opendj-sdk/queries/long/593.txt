We correctly associated event listeners with the pooled connection, but sadly we never invoke them.


	event listeners should be notified when the pooled connection is closed, not the underlying connection
	errors and unsolicited notifications should pass-through
	event listeners should not be left registered against the underlying connection after the pooled connection is closed.
