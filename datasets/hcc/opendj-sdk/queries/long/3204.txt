Found using OpenDJ 3.5.0 (final RC) and OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev 326568b2dd4

While running the OAuth2 functional tests on the Rest2Ldap Gateway we notice sometimes that the container (in which the gateway is deployed) fails to stop.
Seems to happen when we first configure the Gateway with OpenAM resolver and then with CTS resolver.

Added jstack before container stop and jstack generated by Tomcat's shutdown command.
