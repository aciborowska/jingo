Found with rev (4e6298b4b01)

We have a test that sets up 2 DSs and 2 RSs with 6.5.0 version.
It checks replication is working fine then upgrades the servers one by one.
Everything is going fine but when stopping first server at test teardown, we had the following stack trace in server.out:

--- Check for error patterns in "/home/jenkins/workspace/OpenDJ-build_master-CPMER56E632EMKNXZEURRUYWFHY72MGZDGZHN7BYLM5SGO6GS6PA/results/20191031-180440/rs_group/UpgradeTasks/DJREPL1/opendj/logs/server.out" file ---

Note that it happened only that one time but Nicolas noticed this problem also when running some tests on his laptop.
