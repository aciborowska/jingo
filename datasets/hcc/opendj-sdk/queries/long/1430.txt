RobotFramework functional tests sometimes fail with missing changes in the external changelog changeNumber.
What's puzzling is that sometimes the tests pass, and sometimes the test fail. Moreover, when it fails, the missing change is not always the same.

"OpenDJ.Replication.External Changelog.External Changelog Multiple Add Entries On Multiple Servers" test has been failing since r9820.
