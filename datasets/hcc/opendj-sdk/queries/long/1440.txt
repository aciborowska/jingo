Given
A topology with 2 replica + a freshly started replication server.
The replication server did not generate any changeNumbers yet, nor did it receive any changes or heartbeats from the replica.

When
A new change is received from replica 1 and no change or hearbeat has been received for replica 2.

Then
Actual result
The change is published to the external changelog and a new changeNumber is assigned to it.

Expected result
The change CANNOT be published to the external changelog until a change or heartbeat is received from replica 2.
Moreover, if a change is received from replica 2, it could be published to the external changelog before the change from replica 1 depending on global ordering of the CSNs.
