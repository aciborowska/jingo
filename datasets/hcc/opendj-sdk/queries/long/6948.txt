"Virtual" configuration attributes, such as source-address on replication server configuration objects appear in the Configuration Reference on those configuration objects, although they are no longer to be set on those objects.

The fix also prevents "hidden" properties from showing up in the docs, https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/OPENDJ/repos/opendj/pull-requests/4756/diff .
