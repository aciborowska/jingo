While you can configure the JMX connection handler to use SSL, it does not appear to work correctly.

jconsole cannot connect over SSL, and its fallback of using plaintext also fails.

Pointing openssl s_client at the port shows:


$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:1689 -showcerts -tls1
CONNECTED(00000003)

You get the same behaviour even if you force the certificate nickname in the JMX connection handler to the LDAPS cert.
