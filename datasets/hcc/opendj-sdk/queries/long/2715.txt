When importing entries in offline mode with an exclude filter, the messages written to the "--skipFile" file explaining why entries have been excluded from the import are incorrect.
For example, I import using the following command, provided that the only root suffix of the userRoot backend is o=customer :

$ ./bin/import-ldif -l ldif/ns.ldif -n userRoot --skipfile /tmp/skipped --rejectfile /tmp/rejected --overwrite --skipSchemaValidation --skipDNValidation --excludefilter objectclass=nstombstone

$ grep '^#' /tmp/skipped

The correct message should say entries have been skipped because they match the excludefilter (which is true), not because the DN is not one that should be included (which is false).
