Found using OpenDJ SDK 4.0.0.

When running the *rate tools from SDK 4.0.0 in script friendly mode we have for instance the following header line:

time,recent throughput,average throughput,recent response time,average response time,99.9% response time,99.99% response time,99.999% response time,errors/second



=> first the units are missing for each column
=> moreover changing this header line will break the scripts (customers, QA,...) used to parse, graph the tools ouput

Header line for SDK 3.0.0:

Time (seconds),Recent throughput (ops/second),Average throughput (ops/second),Recent response time (milliseconds),Average response time (milliseconds),99.9% re
sponse time (milliseconds),99.99% response time (milliseconds),99.999% response time (milliseconds),Errors/second



I think that we should change this header line and use the same as SDK 3.0.0.
