To reproduce the issue, launch and addrate session with deletion disabled (i,e --deleteMode off)


$ bin/addrate -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password --deleteMode off addrate.template



Expected behavior:
Entries added by the tool should be purged at the end of the execution

Actual behavior:
No entries have been removed and are still present in the server at the end of the tool execution
