When we try to run a specific build phase of the default lifecycle between mvn [clean] generate-sources and mvn [clean] prepare-package included, the build fails due to the following error:

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.forgerock.opendj:opendj-maven-plugin:4.0.0-SNAPSHOT:generate-config (generate-config) on project opendj-config: XSLT configuration transformation failed: sun.net.www.protocol.file.FileURLConnection cannot be cast to java.net.JarURLConnection -> [Help 1]


Note that building a separate module (e.g cd opendj-config; mvn [clean] test) works fine.
It would be nice to fix this build failure in order to allow a user to run any build phase he wants.
