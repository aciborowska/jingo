Nested groups will no longer function correctly after DS restart.


To reproduce the issue:

1) Create a Dynamic Group and add some test attributes
2) Create a Static Group that is nested under the Dynamic Group and add some test attributes
3) Assign the top level Dynamic Group to a test user
4) Query the test user with ldapsearch.  All attributes from both groups will be returned
5) Restart the server and query the test user again.  Only attributes from the top level group will be returned.


	
	
		The directory entries do not change after the restart, but for some reason nested grouping will no longer work.
	
	



The only way to get it to work again is to delete and recreate the groups
