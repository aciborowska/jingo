With OpenDJ 3.0.0 rev b788d2300f238000fd39ca6f0cc4b24ac211157a

We install the rpm package on a CentOs machine.
We set up the server with the following command:


/opt/opendj/setup --acceptLicense --cli -p 1389 --adminConnectorPort 4444 -D cn=myself -w password -b dc=com -d 10 -n



In the output, we see a log file to get details about the setup:


See /tmp/opendj-setup-3864817818968468282.log for a detailed log of this
operation.



The problem is that this file is empty.
