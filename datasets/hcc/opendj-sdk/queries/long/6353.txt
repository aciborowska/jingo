It appears that the ds-proxy-server:7.0.0 profile has not yet been updated to align with changes to the security model:

Parameter:    keyManagerProvider
Description:  Name of the key manager provider used for authenticating the proxy
              in mutual-TLS communications with backend server(s)
Syntax:       Name or configuration expression
Default:      --set ds-proxy-server:7.0.0/keyManagerProvider:Deployment Key
              Manager
...
Parameter:    certNicknames
Description:  Nickname(s) of the certificate(s) that should be sent to the
              server for SSL client authentication.
Syntax:       Name or configuration expression
Default:      --set ds-proxy-server:7.0.0/certNicknames:server-cert


Deployment Key Manager no longer exists, IIRC. It should probably be something like PKCS12 (or, better yet, could be taken from the keystore that's actually used).

Likewise, server-cert could be ssl-key-pair. It would be nice if setup would check the keystore if one is provided to verify that the referenced key pair is actually present.
