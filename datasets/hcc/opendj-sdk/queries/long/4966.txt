When we have an invalid certificate prompt using the dsconfig tool, the error after not trusting the certificate is quite missleading:

1) setup a DS instance with an invalid certificate (e.g. expired)

2) run a dsconfig command, with truststore, in interactive mode, don't trust the certificate


./bin/dsconfig -P /home/viktor/repos/pyforge/results/20180403-142836/opendj4536/tmp/java-client-truststore.jks -T truststorepass -p 1640 list-backends -h viktor.internal.forgerock.com -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -s
The certificate 'CN=viktor.internal.forgerock.com, O=Forgerock, C=FR' is not
trusted for the following reason: NotAfter: Thu Jan 18 11:20:30 CET 2018

Server Certificate:

User DN  : CN=viktor.internal.forgerock.com, O=Forgerock, C=FR
Validity : From 'Wed Jan 17 11:20:30 CET 2018'
             To 'Thu Jan 18 11:20:30 CET 2018'
Issuer   : CN=*.root-ca.forgerock.com, O=Forgerock, C=FR



Do you trust this server certificate?

  1) No
  2) Yes, for this session only
  3) View certificate details

Enter choice: [1]: 1
1


3) check the error afterwards:


Unable to connect to the server at viktor.internal.forgerock.com on port 1640.
In non-interactive mode, if the trustStore related parameters are not used,
you must use the '--trustAll' option for remote connections


The last sentence does not make much sense, as we are in an interactive mode, and we are using a truststore.
