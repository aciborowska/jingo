When no -clearBackend and -append options are used on import-ldif command line, then:

	when running import-ldif on a JE backend with a single baseDN, then the backend will be cleared prior to importing the ldif. It becomes similar in behaviour to --clearBackend.
	when running import-ldif on a JE backend with multiple baseDNs, then the backend will NOT be cleared prior to importing the ldif. It becomes similar in behaviour to --append.




While creating the pluggable backend, we did not understand this logic nor its impact and we decided to only clear the backend when the --clearBackend option was used with import-ldif command line.


What should we do?
Should we stay compatible with JE backend's behaviour regarding imports?
Should we make import-ldif behaviour more predictable/explicit?

Currently it seems impossible to do a clean import of a single baseDN when a JE backend has multiple baseDNs. Do we want to support such use case?
