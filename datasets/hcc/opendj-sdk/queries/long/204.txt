When I start the JNLP based installer, the JDK will learn the proxy setting from Firefox (this can be verified in the java console). This proxy works well for downloading the data, and should therefore be used in the installer.

However, the installer also tries to open the (default) ports for LDAP (389) and admin (4444) without resetting this browser specific proxy setting. This leads to a error message of the installer, that the port cant be used (cause socks server will reject the listen). However the actual server would not use this proxy setting, and so should not the installer. (or maybe recognize proxy related listen problems.) 

IllegalArgumentException: port out of range 65689

(I am using putty ssh client with dynamic port forward as a socks proxy)
