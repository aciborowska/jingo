Paging offsets in rest2ldap are currently page-based instead of record-based. This is not in compliance with the CREST spec as per QueryRequest#getPagedResultsOffset()


    /**
     * Returns the zero-based index of the first resource which should be included in the query results. An offset of 0
     * (default) will return the first resource in the collection. An offset of {@code 1} will return the second, and so
     * on ...
     * <p>
     * <em>Note:</em> Offsets and cookies are mutually exclusive. When a cookie is supplied only the default {@code 0}
     * offset is supported.
     * <p>
     * Offset must be a zero-based integer denoting the number of records to skip. This is very similar to the
     * <code>LIMIT</code> and <code>SKIP</code> clauses in SQL databases.
     *
     * @return The zero-based index within the result set of the first result which should be returned.
     * @see #getPageSize()
     * @see #getPagedResultsCookie()

    int getPagedResultsOffset();
