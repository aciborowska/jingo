Import can use two types of buffers to perform the operation:

	Off-heap buffers using direct memory access through Unsafe (used by default if Unsafe is available)
	Heap buffers using the JVM heap memory.



The problem happen with the Heap buffers. The computation of available heap memory for those buffers is broken preventing the import to start with error message like:


Insufficient free memory (-99017754 bytes) to perform import. At least 52822016 bytes of free memory is required
