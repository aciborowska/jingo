CME is a result of concurrent access to the connection event listener list while closing a connection. This was introduced while back-porting the fix for OPENDJ-590 - the trunk uses a thread safe list implementation whereas the OpenAM version does not.

Fix is to switch over to CopyOnWriteArrayList as per trunk.
