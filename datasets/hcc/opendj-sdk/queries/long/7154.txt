The DS docs :https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/6.5/reference/index.html#supported-languages  currently say the following:
DS 6.5 software is localized in the following languages:
 French
 German
 Japanese
 Simplified Chinese
 Spanish
As discussed here: https://forgerock.slack.com/archives/C7PUY7W1M/p1588080811496400 , this is misleading as DS is only partially localized.
