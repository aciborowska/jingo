After adding a global-aci allowing Kirsten Vaughan to request a subtree delete, Kirsten cannot subtree delete over HTTP but can over LDAP:


$ curl  --request DELETE  --user kvaughan:bribery  http://opendj.example.com:8080/api/users/nbohr?_prettyPrint=true
{
  "code" : 400,
  "reason" : "Bad Request",
  "message" : "Not Allowed on Non-Leaf: The entry 'uid=nbohr,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' cannot be removed because it has subordinate entries"
}
$ ldapdelete -x -D "uid=kvaughan,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" -w bribery - 1389 uid=nbohr,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
Processing DELETE request for uid=nbohr,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
DELETE operation successful for DN uid=nbohr,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com



BTW, nice RESTful reference to the entry in the JSON response message.
