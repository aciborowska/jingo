When using dsconfig in interactive mode to create a backend, the user is asked to choose a type of backend

>>>> Select the type of Backend that you want to create:

    1)  JE Backend
    2)  LDIF Backend
    3)  Memory Backend
    4)  Proxy Backend

    a)  show advanced components and properties
    q)  quit
    c)  cancel
    ?)  help


The Memory Backend is not a production backend and should not be exposed there.
 Furthermore, there is nothing in the help description that says that the memory backend is for development and testing only, and not to be used in production (see the help description of the null backend).

We should mark Memory Backend as "Advanced".
