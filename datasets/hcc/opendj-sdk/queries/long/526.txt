The current chapter on Samba password synchronization starts too abruptly, http://opendj.forgerock.org/doc/admin-guide/index.html#chap-samba

Instead of diving right into the details, start by providing at least a little context on why someone might use Samba password synchronization in the first place (Hint: because they have to store Samba accounts somewhere, and unless their setup is small or disposable, it might as well be OpenDJ).
