During functional tests, I noticed a new file in the server layout right after extracting the archive.

The file is "lib/opendj-je-backend.jar". I have found that this file has been removed in 4.0.0 as result of the issue OPENDJ-3796.

However, it is not clear when this file appears in the layout (any result of some backport)?
