Was raised against OpenDS (http://java.net/jira/browse/OPENDS-4600).

When doing a delete on a non existing attribute, the server reports an error 16, No Such Attribute.
However if the Permissive Modify control is part of the request, the server should return success and do nothing.

With sample ldif generated by Setup (or MakeLDIF).

$ bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1389 -D cn=Directory\ Manager -w secret12 -J 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1413 
dn: uid=user.0,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com 
changetype: modify 
delete: employeeType 

Processing MODIFY request for uid=user.0,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com 
MODIFY operation failed 
Result Code: 16 (No Such Attribute) 
Additional Information: Entry uid=user.0,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com cannot 
be modified because an attempt was made to remove one or more values from 
attribute employeeType but this attribute is not present in the entry
