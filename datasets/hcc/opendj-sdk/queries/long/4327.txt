Configure the JMX connection handler and assign jmx-read privileges as per the admin guide.

Connect jconsole to OpenDJ as the privileged user and inspect org.opends.server > rootDSE > cn-monitor > cn-Client_Connections > Attributes > connection

If there are no other connections, jconsole will show one connection:


connID="1" connectTime="20170925130002Z" jmxConnID="rmi://127.0.0.1 cn=Directory_Manager 1" authDN="cn=Directory Manager,cn=Root DNs,cn=config"



If you create another connection (eg run ldapmodify in another window, which binds but does not send any modify ops) and refresh jconsole, you will see:


java.lang.String[2]



This does not seem useful or correct. I would expect to see one value per connection.
