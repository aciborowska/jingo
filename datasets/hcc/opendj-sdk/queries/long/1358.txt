An recurring incremental backup task is configured with a non-existent parent ID:


$ bin/backup -h laptop.local -p 4444 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -X -n userRoot -I incremental --incremental -B total --recurringTask "31,32,36,37 14 * * *" -d `pwd`/bak



When the task runs, it fails and logs:


[26/Feb/2014:14:36:00 +0000] category=TOOLS severity=SEVERE_ERROR msgID=10748169 msg=An error occurred while attempting to back up backend userRoot with the requested configuration:  The information for backup /Users/cjr/Documents/workspace/test/opendj/bak could not be found in the backup directory total



It looks like it should read "The information for backup total could not be found in the backup directory /Users/cjr/[...]".
