While trying to evaluate the impact of the fix for OPENDJ-1906, I set up some tests to repeatedly read isMemberOf attributes with some empty static groups. This should show the impact of each group requiring a read lock.


2.6.3 (no patch) 8.4k searches/sec
2.6.4 (patch) 7.3k
3.0.0 (no patch) 2.1k
4.0.0 (patch) 2.5k



The drop from 8.4k to 7.3k seemed about in line with what I expected.

But there's a distinct drop in throughput in 3.0.0 relative to 2.6. Some jstacks appeared to show a lot of worker threads busy converting inside the isMemberOf virtual attribute provider from server DNs to SDK DNs. OPENDJ-1342 may be relevant.

To remove any way for my patch to influence the result, I changed searchrate to only requesting no attributes (1.1).

See the jstacks1.1.txt attachment for a couple of jstacks of the server doing these searches.
So there does look like a general issue unrelated to my patch.
