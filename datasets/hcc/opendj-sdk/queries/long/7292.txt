dsreplication status reports the following overflow error.

Error reading registration information. Details: The provided value
"5277383431" could not be parsed as an integer
See /tmp/opendj-replication-3834834454889324993.log for a detailed log of this operation.



This is approximately the current replication delay as seen in cn=monitor and the uptime.


dn: ds-mon-domain-name=o=example,cn=replicas,cn=replication,cn=monitor
ds-mon-server-id: 22125
ds-mon-current-delay: 5344867760



Looks like an int overrun issue withÂ `asInteger(-1)`



replica.setCurrentDelay(sr.parseAttribute("ds-mon-current-delay").asInteger(-1));
