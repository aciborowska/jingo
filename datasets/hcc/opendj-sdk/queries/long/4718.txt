This issue is a must fix for 6.0.0. It raises a couple of additional issues:

	our tests (unit and functional) are not detecting this non-compliant behavior
	our own client tools hide the problem by de-duplicating the results.



I will raise separate issues for these.

Test case:

	install DJ with default data
	perform an LDAP search using the SDK client against any entry, the bug is independent of the backend type:





$ ldapsearch -p 1389 -h localhost -b "dc=example,dc=com" -s base "(&)"
dn: dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: domain
dc: example



	repeat the search with the OpenLDAP client:





$ ldapsearch -LLL -p 1389 -x -h localhost -b "dc=example,dc=com" -s base "(&)" 
dn: dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: domain
objectClass: top
objectClass: domain
dc: example
