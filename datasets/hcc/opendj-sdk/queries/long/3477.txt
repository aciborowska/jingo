There seems to be a problem viewing user entries in the control panel if those entries are created in DJ outside of the control panel. In my case I do the following:

	create a user in DJ over REST (using IDM's scripted rest connector)
	launch the control panel
	select Manage Entries



I can see that user entry, but attempting to select it just shows No Entry Selected (see attached screen shot).
