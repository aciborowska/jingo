When running the status tool, the only working option now is to use --trustAll, or chose "1) Automatically trust" in the interactive prompt. Both using a truststore, or "3) Manually validate" results in a connection error.

Steps to reproduce:

1) install DS (note I used a FQDN to setup the server viktor.internal.forgerock.com)

2) run the status tool in interactive mode


./bin/status 

>>>> Specify OpenDJ LDAP connection parameters

How do you want to trust the server certificate?

1) Automatically trust
2) Use a truststore
3) Manually validate

Enter choice [3]: 3

Administrator user bind DN [cn=Directory Manager]: 

Password for user 'cn=Directory Manager': 
Unable to connect to the server at "viktor-dell" on port 4444


3) run the status tool providing all options in the command


./bin/status -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -P /home/viktor/repos/pyforge/results/20180228-101825/opendj4536/tmp/java-client-truststore.jks -T truststorepass
Unable to connect to the server at "viktor-dell" on port 4444


The problem is probably with the certificate having a wrong host, the problem is, there is no way to specify the host for the status command. Anyway, even for a wronghost certificate, we should get a prompt explaining what's wrong and allowing to trust the cert.
