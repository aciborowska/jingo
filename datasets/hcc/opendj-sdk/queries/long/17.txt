OpenDJ has a script to generate an RC-script for Linux.

The generated script has several issues (Reported by bignate on OpenDS) :

	It is not chkconfig compliant.
	the --quiet option is outside the quotes and interpreted by the su command and not the start-ds/stop-ds
	when invoking the script as root, from a privileged directory but the
daemon will be run by a non privileged user, the underlying script tries to cd 
to the directory from which it was invoked causing an error:



  /opt/opends/bin/start-ds: line 41: cd: /root: Permission denied
