I updated the rpms on our test setup today and found a small bug
in the RPM.

Opendj version before 2.6.0-1
Opendj status: running
Opendj version after update 2.6.1-1

We configured the service to run under the user id "opendj"
all files under /opt/opendj belong to opendj and the
init.d script is configured to start the opendj process
as opendj

Problem:
I updated the rpm, this show no problems on console. The service
was restarted. But afterwards
the files under /opt/opendj belong to root. And the process
opendj belongs also to root, because the service was automatically 
restarted in the rpm update 

Workaround:

	Stop opendj. (don't use the init.d script because it uses
the opendj account)




	chown the files back to opendj. (otherwise it wouldn't start
again because the logfiles belong to root)




	Start opendj again



Expected:
I think the rpm should not restart the service but give advice to
check the ownership of the files

	or -
The ownership of the files should be considered, and the init.d script
should be used for restart
