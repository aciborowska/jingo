Extensible ObjectClass is a special object class which allows any attributes to be specified.
While the server's ObjectClass class correctly supports extensible objects, the SDK does not.
In particular, its method isRequired(), isOptional and isRequiredOrOptional() should always return true for the extensible object class.
