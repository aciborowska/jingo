The replication connect thread consumes a lot of CPU due to inefficient address normalization. I have seen the thread consuming 5-10% CPU on some systems even when the topology is fully connected.

Possible improvements:


	attempt to connect less frequently, or at least make the frequency configurable. Currently it is 1 second
	skip the connect loop if we determine that the number of connections equals the number of configured servers (i.e. we are fully connected)
	re-order the normalization checks to prioritize cheap tests first and expensive tests later
	cache normalized addresses, although we need to ensure that the cache is refreshed every so often in order to handle network configuration changes.
