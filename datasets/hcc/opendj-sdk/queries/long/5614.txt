While testing write distribution with proxy, we set up 3 DJs, each one in a shard and a proxy configured to distribute ou=people,o=example on all 3 shards.

We add some entries in the proxy and they are distributed on all DJs.
Then we use ldapdelete with deleteSubtree on ou=People,o=example through the proxy and we search through the proxy:


./PROXY/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h nameserver.example.com -p 1392 -D "uid=data admin,o=example" -w password -b "ou=People,o=example" -s sub --countEntries "(objectclass=*)"  dn
dn: uid=user.0,ou=People,o=example
dn: uid=user.1,ou=People,o=example

....
dn: uid=user.99,ou=People,o=example

 # The LDAP search request failed: 32 (No Such Entry) # Additional Information: The search base entry 'ou=People,o=example' does not exist # Matched DN: o=example




ldapsearch fails as it aggregates the search on the 3 shards and one is empty.
It looks a bit confusing.
