The current docs show, how to create a UniqueAttributePlugin for a single type, only.
Wrt. shallow explanation/examples the user might get the impression, that he needs to create a new Instance for every unique attr (also because the create-plugin subcmd does not accept '-add ...' as for basedn:...). So just another example with something like "-set type:uid --set type:mail" would probably help.

Also IMHO docs could be a little bit improved, by adding a note, that if one needs to have unique attributes scoped to a certain set of subtrees aka baseDNs only, one needs to create an instance for each set (e.g. if one has a suffix o=myorg and another o=inet and UIDs below a suffix need to be unique, only).
