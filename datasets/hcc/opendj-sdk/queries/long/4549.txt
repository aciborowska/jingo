Found with 6.0.0 rev 8223c75655e

We have a regression in our tests with ldapmodify.
We setup a server with some data.
We use ldapmodify with -c (continueOnError) option and  -f option with an ldif file containing wrong values for changetype or newrdn etc. 
We expect to have a 0 return code but it returns 2:

BEFORE:

./DJ1/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w password -c /tmp/ldapmodify_changes.ldif

# An error occurred while attempting to read the contents of LDIF file(s):  Unable to parse LDIF change record starting at line 1 with distinguished name "ou=nochangetype,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com" because there was no change type
# An error occurred while attempting to read the contents of LDIF file(s):  Unable to parse LDIF change record starting at line 3 with distinguished name "o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com" because it contained an unrecognized changetype "invalid". The changetype must be one of add, delete, modify, modrdn, or moddn
# An error occurred while attempting to read the contents of LDIF file(s):  Unable to parse LDIF modify record starting at line 8 with distinguished name "ou=ldapmodify,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com" because it contained an unrecognized modification type "invalid". The modification type must be one of add, delete, replace, or increment
# Processing MODIFY request for uid=user.7,ou=ldapmodify,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com
# MODIFY operation successful for DN uid=user.7,ou=ldapmodify,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com
# An error occurred while attempting to read the contents of LDIF file(s):  Unable to parse LDIF modify DN record starting at line 18 with distinguished name "o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com" because there was no new RDN
# An error occurred while attempting to read the contents of LDIF file(s):  Unable to parse LDIF modify DN record starting at line 21 with distinguished name "o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com" because it contained a malformed new RDN "invalid"
# An error occurred while attempting to read the contents of LDIF file(s):  Unable to parse LDIF modify DN record starting at line 26 with distinguished name "ou=ldapmodify,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com" because it contained a malformed deleteoldrdn "invalid"

$ echo $?
0



NOW:

DJ1/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1390 -D "cn=myself" -w password -c /tmp/ldapmodify_changes.ldif
# The LDAP modify request failed: 2 (Protocol Error)
# Additional Information:  Unable to parse LDIF change record starting at line 1 with distinguished name "ou=nochangetype,o=clu tests,dc=example,dc=com" because there was no change type



If we do not use the -c option, before it used to return 89, but now it returns 2.
