Empty EntryIDSet has an inconsistent behavior during serialization/de-serialization which might leads to bugs.
Indeed, de-serializing a serialized empty EntryIDSet led to an undefined EntryIDSet rather than a defined and empty one.

We should check and enforce whether an empty EntryIDSet should be considered has defined or not and that serialization/deserialization is a truly reversible operation. 

Note that in 2.6.0, the serialization returned null in case of an empty defined set.
