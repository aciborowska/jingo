Once a DebugTracer is created its internal settings may become stale if the debug configuration changes. In other words, a server restart is required in order for the changes to take effect.

One possible solution which avoids performance impact would be to version the debug config. Each time a DebugTracer logs something it checks whether its version is the same as the debug config version, refreshing its settings if needed. The debug config version is incremented whenever a config change is made.
