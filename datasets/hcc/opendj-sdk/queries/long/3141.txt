Get with wrong user:

$ http -a wrongUser:admin_password "http://localhost:8082/read/user.0" Content-Type:"application/json"

    "code": 401,
    "message": "Invalid Credentials: No Results Returned: The search request succeeded but did not return any search result entries when one was expected",

}



==> we should get a more "generic" message (like the embedded mode):
"message": "Invalid Credentials"
