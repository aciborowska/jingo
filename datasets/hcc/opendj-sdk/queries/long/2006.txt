Attempting to enable logging in grizzly (to diagnose a problem) results in no logging!

Our HTTP Connection Handler is the culprit - it explicitly disables logging from grizzly:



  private void startHttpServer() throws Exception
  {
    // silence Grizzly's own logging
    Logger.getLogger("org.glassfish.grizzly").setLevel(Level.OFF);



This is unhelpful to say the least.
