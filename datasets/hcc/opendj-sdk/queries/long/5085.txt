Offline restore of the adminRoot backend or the truststore backend fails because it cannot acquire an exclusive lock on the backend file (a shared lock is already held).

Steps to reproduce (for truststore backend):

	Deploy and setup DJ without starting the server
	Backup the truststore backend offline

backup  -d ~/deploy/opendj/bak --backendId "ads-truststore" --offline






	Restore the trustore backend offline

restore -d ~/deploy/opendj/bak --offline

The attempt to obtain an exclusive lock on file /Users/cyril/deploy/opendj/locks/backend-ads-truststore.lock was rejected because a shared lock was already held on that file.  This generally means some other process is still using this backend (e.g., it is in use by the Directory Server or a backup or LDIF export is in progress).  The restore cannot continue

Cause:
 When a tool is running, adminRoot backend and truststore backend are enabled and a shared lock is acquired on each of the backend files. (see org.opends.server.core.DirectoryServer#initializeRootAndAdminDataBackends)
 In online mode we don't have this problem because the backend is disabled by {{org.opends.server.tasks.RestoreTask#runTask }} which releases the shared lock on the backend file.
