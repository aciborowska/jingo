With the new setup, the default is to use the JVM trust manager. When doing so, the server is created with an invalid entry for the Administration Connector.
The ds-cfg-trust-manager-provider attribute is mandatory per the schema, yet the entry is created without. This will cause any change to the Admin Connector to fail with a schema violation:

The Administration Connector could not be modified due to a communications
problem: Object Class Violation: Entry cn=Administration Connector,cn=config
cannot be modified because the resulting entry would have violated the server
schema: Entry cn=Administration Connector,cn=config violates the Directory
Server schema configuration because it is missing attribute
ds-cfg-trust-manager-provider which is required by objectclass

The entry in config.ldif is as below:


dn: cn=Administration Connector,cn=config
objectClass: top
objectClass: ds-cfg-administration-connector
cn: Administration Connector
ds-cfg-listen-address: 0.0.0.0
ds-cfg-listen-port: 4444
ds-cfg-ssl-cert-nickname: server-cert
ds-cfg-key-manager-provider: cn=PKCS12,cn=Key Manager Providers,cn=config
