When using dsconfig to configure set-log-publisher-prop the command "fails" with an undefined error. This issue only exists on embedded DJ and only happens if the property is configured straight after AM has been configured before AM is restarted. The property is properly set, the message seems spurious. 

1. Stop AM/Tomcat 2. Clear openam config directory 3. Start AM/Tomcat 4. Run OpenAM configuration 5. run dslogger.sh script attached.  6.  The following message is received:

 

[fr@ambate02 edf]$ ./dsloggerfile.sh
Changing File-Based Access Logger    success
Changing File-Based Audit Logger    success
Changing File-Based Debug Logger    success
Changing File-Based Error Logger

The File Based Error Log Publisher could not be modified due to a communications problem: Undefined

failed
Changing File-Based HTTP Access Logger    success

 

If AM is restarted after step 4 then no errors are reported.
