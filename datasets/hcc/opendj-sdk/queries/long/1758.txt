After fresh install of OpenDJ 3.0.0 if I run the control-panel and click on backup or restore button on left side it will cause Config exception.

Quick steps to install the OpenDJ:

	./setup --cli
	
		cn -> whatever
		password -> whatever
		hostname -> default
		create base dn -> yes - dc=whatever,dc=com
		just create base entry
		ssl - > no
		tls - > no
		setup
	
	



It's important to note that I am able to add new object class via ldapmodify command line tool and also it's possible manually change the 99-user.ldif file and restart the server.

Screenshots attached.
