With OpenDJ 3.0.0 rev f8d85405cc4c4c8385293459685503f451ee23b8
with JE backend type

We create a first backend with db-cache-percent set to 50%.
We create a second backend with db-cache-percent set to 50%.

We are expecting this operation not to be allowed so that we do not reach the 100% of jvm capability. (given also that there is a check on the limit you can give to a single backend for the db-cache-percent, that is between 1 and 90 included)
