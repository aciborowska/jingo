In adding a short explanation for the dbtest list-index-status subcommand, I notice that although the text is folded in the usage message for dbtest --help, the text is not folded in the usage message for dbtest list-index-status --help.

So this looks fine:



$ ./build/package/OpenDJ-3.0.0/bin/dbtest --help
This utility can be used to debug the JE database

Usage:  java org.opends.server.tools.DBTest {subcommand} {options}

Available subcommands:

...
list-index-status
    List the status of indexes in an entry container. This subcommand can take
    a long time to complete, as it reads all indexes for all backends.
...



(Also notice that the usage message shows the fully-qualified class name instead of the command name. I believe that is the subject of another issue.)

But this is not correctly formatted:



$ ./build/package/OpenDJ-3.0.0/bin/dbtest list-index-status --help
Usage:  java org.opends.server.tools.DBTest  {options}  java org.opends.server.tools.DBTest list-index-status {options}
List the status of indexes in an entry container. This subcommand can take a long time to complete, as it reads all indexes for all backends.

Global Options:
    See "java org.opends.server.tools.DBTest --help"
