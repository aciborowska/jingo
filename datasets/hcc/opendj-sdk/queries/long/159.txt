It's pretty standard usage to do something like this:

1) Create an LDAP connection factory
2) Connect to an LDAP server
3) Read the server's schema
4) Set the default schema to the server's schema
5) Perform a search
6) Attempt to get an attribute from the entry which is in the server's schema but not in the core schema (the original default) using a method like Entry.getAttribute("mail").

Step 6 will fail because the connection ignores the fact that the default schema has changed and continues to use the original default schema (core schema) which does not contain a definition of the attribute "mail". This means that the search contains an attribute whose OID is "mail-oid" causing the subsequent lookup of "mail" (OID 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3) to fail.
