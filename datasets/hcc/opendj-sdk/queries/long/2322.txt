With OpenDJ-3.0.0 rev d127499b88dfe2d53370025b5d1de485ac6786d5

We have a stress test that performs read operations using rest2ldap enabling the HttpConnectionHandler.

Some requests regularly failed with an HTTP  500 error.
(see script in attachment to reproduce this problem, you need to copy OpenDJ archive and gatling bundle zip in the script location, plus the gatling scenario Rest2LdapRead.scala under ./GATLING/gatling-charts-highcharts-bundle-2.1.4/user-files/simulations)

Unfortunately, nothing is traced anywhere.

If we use rest2ldap gateway deployed in tomcat, we do not get these random failures.
