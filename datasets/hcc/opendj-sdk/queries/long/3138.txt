Found using OpenDJ-4.0.0 rev 317f75527a2

Problem occurs on Linux and Windows

Scenario

	install a server and enable SNMP Connection Handler
	set a wrong value for opendmk-jarfile or security-agent-file, for instance:

C:> opendj\bat\dsconfig.bat -h ig-robot-windows.internal.forgerock.com -p 4444 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X set-connection-handler-prop --handler-name "SNMP Connection Handler" --set opendmk-jarfile:opendj\wrong_file -n


	restart the server



In the start output we should see some error messages to indicate that the SNMP connection handler is not correctly configured (like "Cannot initialize the SNMP Connection Handler...") but we don't have errors at startup.
