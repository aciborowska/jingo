When processing bind requests we perform an unnecessary DNS reverse lookup which may timeout out in certain network environments causing a pause of several seconds in the client.

The hostname will only be needed when performing certain SASL bind requests (e.g. DIGEST-MD5) and it is questionable whether we should be overriding the user provided hostname anyway.
