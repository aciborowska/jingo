Restricted root Base Dns is a list containing Base DN which should be involved when the server received a search on the root base dn. This allows the server to expose only part of the base-dn it's serving.

Because CoreConfigManager is trying to validate the configured base-dn by looking up for  a corresponding LocalBackend, these base-dns could not reference a ProxyBackend.

Base DNs served by ProxyBackend should be allowed to be part of this restricted set as well.
