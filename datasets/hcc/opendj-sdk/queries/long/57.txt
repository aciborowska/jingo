It's been reported when the changelog is purged such so that it becomes empty (i.e. if there are no updates during a sustained period) then the lastChangeNumber and firstChangeNumber attributes are reset to zero. We need to verify this behavior and fix it. Change numbers should not go backwards. In fact, on emptying I would expect the next generated change number to be greater than the previous lastChangeNumber.
