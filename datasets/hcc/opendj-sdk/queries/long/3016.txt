Scenario
1. Run and ldapsearch with filter which contains special characters like \n\t\r


ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1390 -D "cn=dm" -w pwd -T -b "ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" "(cn=Pa\t\n\rBakers)" uid



Actual behavior/results
On 4.0.0 we have error which says:
The provided search filter "(cn=Pa" had mismatched parentheses around the portion between positions 0 and 6
 with rc==89.

Expected behavior/results
The rfc2251 says "Servers MUST NOT return errors", based on that we can approve both types of behavior (with and without error). I only expect same behavior between versions.

Update 
The behavior is reproducible only on Windows.
