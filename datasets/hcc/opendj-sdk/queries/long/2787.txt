We have a testsuite that has a sequence of steps that now generates an error when starting the server.

Scenario:


	we setup 2 servers, start them and enable replication
	we stop these servers and import  a set of data on one server
	we start the servers again and initialize the replication
	we add some entries using ldapmodify and a file
	we modify rdn of 3 users and check the 3 entries are ok on both servers
	we stop both servers and import the same set of data we had initially
	we start both servers and hit the following issue on the first one:
