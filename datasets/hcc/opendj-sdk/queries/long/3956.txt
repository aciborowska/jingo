We are importing 8000 entries of data(ldif file) into opendj for creating one OU through LDAP SDK(Programatically). Right now we are using the below snippet. we are using opendj2.6.2.
InputStream in = IOUtils.toInputStream(ldif, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
LDIFChangeRecordReader reader = new LDIFChangeRecordReader(in);
ConnectionChangeRecordWriter changeRecordWriter = new ConnectionChangeRecordWriter(connection)) {
while (reader.hasNext()) 
{
ChangeRecord changeRecord = reader.readChangeRecord();
changeRecordWriter.writeChangeRecord(changeRecord);
}
Problem: The problem with this approach is, it reads each record from the ldif and write to opendj and its synchronous(by its nature).
So we need to loop through 8000 times(since we have 8000 entries in ldif file), which is resulting response time in minutes.
we want to optimize this operation in seconds. is there a way where we can send entries in bulk rather than individual entries? or Do we have a better solution.
we are in need, it would be greatful if you help us out.
