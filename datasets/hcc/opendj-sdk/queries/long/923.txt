On Windows only, wrong exit code for restart task with execution date in the past.

C:> C:/opendj/bat/stop-ds.bat -h localhost -p 4444 -X -D "cn=myself" -w "password" -R -t "20061212000000"
The specified stop time '20061212000000' has already passed
C:> echo %errorlevel%
0

=> we should get an exit code of 89 as on Unix platform
