Double-clicking QuickSetup.app works.

Double-clicking ControlPanel.app fails. The icon bounces briefly in the Dock and the system.log contains:


May 16 14:55:26 rih.local JavaApplicationStub[67310]: Unrecognized Java VM option ignored: -client
May 16 14:55:26 rih com.apple.launchd.peruser.502[143] ([0x0-0x1123122].org.opends.guitools.controlpanel.ControlPanelLauncher[67310]): Exited with code: 1



(QuickSetup.app logs the Unrecognized Java VM option warning as well, so it is apparently not the problem.)

Running bin/control-panel from the command-line works. Using open(1) from the command-line fails but shows some more detail:


$ open bin/ControlPanel.app
LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Users/cjr/Documents/workspace/opendj-trunk/build/package/OpenDJ-2.5.0/bin/ControlPanel.app.
