In the case where rest2ldap were not able to resolve the authzIdTemplate (which is set in the json configuration file) with access token informations we were returned a 403 (forbidden) error response.
As Matthew Swift have explained in a PR comment: In this particular, case the cause of the error is a little ambiguous. It could be a fault in the server (rest2ldap) due to bad configuration or a fault in the OAuth2 AS. I think a bad configuration is more likely, so we should return a 500 error
