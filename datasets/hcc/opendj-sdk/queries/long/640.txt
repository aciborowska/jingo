When developing a web application and you have a search such as:

(|(sn=*smith*)(givenName=*smith*)(telephoneNumber=*smith*)


queried against the LDAP server, the telephoneNumber (And possibly other non string equality syntax searches) appear to be performing a full table scan and can be very slow on large databases.

I enabled "index-filter-analyzer-enabled" on the database and performed searches similar to the above and noticed that it didn't count as an index search. If I query a number sequence in the above query for telephoneNumber, the return is quick and accurate. if I omit the telephoneNumber stanza in the query above the search is also quick and accurate.

It seems like the server should either still be able to use it's indexes and find no smith component in the telephoneNumber attribute, or recognize that the search does not match the syntax and ignore it.

This issue prevents us from including telephoneNumber searches in the simple search box of our web application.
