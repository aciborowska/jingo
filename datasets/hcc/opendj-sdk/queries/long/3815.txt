I discovered following error message during functional tests run:

[06/Mar/2017:06:47:04 +0000] category=org.opends.messages.external severity=ERROR msgID=1 msg=Unable to close filewriters during org.forgerock.audit.handlers.csv.CsvAuditEventHandler cleanup


At the time, when the message is written to the log, the test disables the csv publisher and than it enables it again.
