Steps to reproduce using a stopped instance:

	Start Control-Panel
	press start button
	cancel the authn screen
	manage entries
Note that Delete Base DN and Delete Backend isn't grayed out.
Try to execute either of these commands, it will result in an NPE, also the new window showing the message about the NPE is in the background, instead of popping up.
