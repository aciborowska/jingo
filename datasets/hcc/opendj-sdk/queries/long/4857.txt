When using dsreplication against a port with invalid certificate, we get a prompt asking if we want to trust the certificate, but no message about why the certificate is invalid (as we get with other tools).

Steps to reproduce:

1) Configure two DS' with LDAPS ports providing certificates that are signed by a cert in client's truststore, but are invalid for some reason (expired, wronghost, ...)

2) Try to configure replication between the two servers, using these LDAPS ports as admin connectors


./bin/dsreplication configure --host1 security-centos7.internal.forgerock.com --port1 1643 --bindDN1 "cn=Directory Manager" --bindPassword1 "password" --replicationPort1 8990 --host2 security-centos7.internal.forgerock.com --bindDN2 "cn=Directory Manager" --bindPassword2 "password" --replicationPort2 8989 -b o=example -I admin -w password --secureReplication2 --secureReplication1 -P /local/workspace/Security/DJ-Security-Issues-Others/results/20180302-054418/opendj4536/tmp/java-client-truststore.jks -T truststorepass --port2 1640


3) check the tool output:


Server Certificate:	
		
		
		
User DN : CN=security-centos7.internal.forgerock.com, O=Forgerock, C=FR	
Validity : From 'Wed Jan 17 11:20:30 CET 2018'	
           To 'Thu Jan 18 11:20:30 CET 2018'	
Issuer : CN=*.root-ca.forgerock.com, O=Forgerock, C=FR	
	
Do you trust this server certificate?	
	
1) No	
2) Yes, for this session only	
3) Yes, also add it to a truststore	
4) View certificate details	
	
Enter choice [2]:	
1


You can see from the presented certificate it is expired, but there is no error message present like in other tools.
