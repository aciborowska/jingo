This conflict testcase 'add_child_del_parent' is failing in functional tests.

#@TestName           Replication: Conflict: add_child_del_parent
#@TestID             add_child_del_parent
#@TestPurpose        Add a child vs delete his parent
#@TestPreamble
#@TestSteps          Add entry cn=P1 to server1
#@TestSteps          Disconnect Replication Servers
#@TestSteps          server2: add child cn=C1,cn=P1
#@TestSteps          server1: delete parent cn=P1
#@TestSteps          Re-connect Replication Servers
#@TestSteps          Check servers are synchronised

After re-enabling it looks like on server2 the entry cn=P1 is removed, but on server1 the add of cn=C1,cn=P1 is being replayed and results in an unresolved conflict.
After this the two servers are not in the same state.

I wonder if the del of cn=P1 on server 1 is a plain delete, but when it is replayed on server 2 is just deletes the entry but not cn=C1,cn=P1 (i.e,) not subtree delete.
