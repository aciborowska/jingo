After enabling replication between my laptop (bigmac.internal.forgerock.com) and a remote lab machine (brie.internal.forgerock.com), the remote DJ keeps logging in errors log:

The IP address of bigmac.internal.forgerock.com cannot indeed be resolved on brie.internal.forgerock.com.
However, the message should not be logged thousands of times (about 5 times per seconds), making it quite difficult to find any other error message.
