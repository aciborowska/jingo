Dear Team,

I am trying to update my Directory schema by adding a coustom attribute as per the documentation : "Updating Directory Schema" OpenDJ Administration Guide Managing Schema ".

URL: http://opendj.forgerock.org/opendj-server/doc/webhelp/admin-guide/update-schema.html

However, after update. 
I constantly get the following error:
#!ERROR [LDAP: error code 65 - Entry uid=abarnes,ou=People,dc=root,dc=com cannot be modified because the resulting entry would have violated the server schema:  Entry uid=abarnes,ou=People,dc=root,dc=com violates the Directory Server schema configuration because it includes attribute RegistrationID which is not allowed by any of the objectclasses defined in that entry]

RegistrationID is my custom attribute.

I have restarted OpenDJ several time, unfortunately that doesn't help either.
