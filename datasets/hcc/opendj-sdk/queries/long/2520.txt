With OpenDJ 3.0.0 M6, rpm package, installed on CentOS release 6.5

We install the rpm package:

rpm -i opendj-3.0.0_1.noarch.rpm



setup the server:

 /opt/opendj/setup --acceptLicense --cli -p 1389 --adminConnectorPort 4444 -D cn=myself -w password -b dc=com -d 10 -n



we check the service:

# service opendj status
opendj status: > Running.



we check the server is started through the /opt/opendj/bin/status command as well.

we check the service levels:

# chkconfig --list | grep opendj
opendj         0:off    1:off    2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off



and reboot the machine.

At restart, we check the service status:

# service opendj status
opendj status: > Running.



and yet the server is not running:

/opt/opendj/bin/status

          --- Server Status ---
Server Run Status:        Stopped



(pid file is persistent in /opt/opendj/logs directory)
