As a user, I want modrate/searchrate to be able to execute a server warm up phase to let the server JIT kick in.

During this phase, no stats should be registered because a server where JIT has not kicked in does not provide relevant performance information (particularly thinking of the 99.9, 99.99 and 99.999 percentile).

However, errors should be reported to let the user know of possible issues with the commands he is running.
