Doing some AuthN load testing with OpenAM 12.
(See https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/QA/2+OpenAM+with+SFO+-+AuthN+load for more infos)

OpenDJ 2.6.2 is configured as an external CTS, more specifically with an ordering index for attribute  coreTokenExpirationDate.

AuthN load at OpenAM level causes ldap add and delete of token entries (containing  coreTokenExpirationDate attr) at DJ CTS level (for session persistence).

After about 15 min, we get the following error on the DJ errors log.
[17/Dec/2014:17:38:10 +0100] category=JEB severity=SEVERE_ERROR msgID=8650903 msg=An error occurred while reading from index dc_openam_dc_forgerock_dc_com_coreTokenExpirationDate.ordering. The index seems to be corrupt and is now operating in a degraded state. The index must be rebuilt before it can return to normal operation
