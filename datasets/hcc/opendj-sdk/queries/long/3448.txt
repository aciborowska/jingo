While using json attribute value and trying to change the json syntax validation policy, we encounter the following error:


./opendj/bin/dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X set-schema-provider-prop --provider-name "Core Schema" --advanced --set json-validation-policy:lenient -n 	

The Core Schema could not be modified due to a communications problem: Object
Class Violation: Entry cn=Core Schema,cn=Schema Providers,cn=config cannot be
modified because the resulting entry would have violated the server schema:
Entry cn=Core Schema,cn=Schema Providers,cn=config violates the Directory
Server schema configuration because it includes attribute
ds-cfg-json-validation-policy which is not allowed by any of the objectclasses
defined in that entry
