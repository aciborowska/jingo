Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 RC4.

After an upgrade to 4.0.0 the "<instance_dir>/extlib" does not exist so this prevents to use some CAUD external handlers like JDBC or JMS for which we have dependencies on external jars (to place in this extlib folder).

Workaround: create the extlib folder manually before configuring JDBC or JMS external handlers
