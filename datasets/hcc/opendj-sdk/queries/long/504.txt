We found a strange problem trying to port over our data from an existing Sun Directory Server to the OpenDJ server, First telephone numbers are being allowed to import that are not allowed ex. '831-555-5454 (Library)' i.e. non numbers are accepted, and if we then perform a query against the telephone number attribute with wildcards that are not number we retrieve all entries that have telephoneNumber populated:

For example the following works as expected:
ldapsearch ... '(telephoneNumber=5454)'

The following returns all entries that have telephoneNumber populated even when substring is not present:

ldapsearch ... '(telephoineNumber=userid)'

In our particular case we had 3500 entries that have telephone number populated with just numbers and dashes however the above query returns all of them and none of them have userid in telephoneNumber.
