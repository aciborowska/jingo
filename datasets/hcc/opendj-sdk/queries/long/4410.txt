Found using OpenDJ 5.5.0 final (rev 4cafc285fa595390b8b9a3a96125abf6316ba4c6)

The file ThirdPartyCopyright.txt was renamed in third-party-copyrights.txt, so to avoid ending-up with the 2 files after upgrade from 5.0.0 to 5.5.0, we should add an upgrade task to remove legal-notices/ThirdPartyCopyright.txt file.
