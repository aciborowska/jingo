In the DS 6.5 Admin Guide, under https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/6.5/admin-guide/#set-database-backend-disk-thresholds , 

it says:


A directory server continues to apply replication updates without regard to the thresholds. The server can therefore fill available disk space despite the thresholds, by accepting replication updates made on other servers. You can give yourself more time to react to the situation both by monitoring directory data growth and also by increasing the thresholds.


However, this is incorrect. When the disk-full-threshold has been reached, DS does not allow replication updates and gives the following error instead:


(alert type org.opends.server.DiskFull, alert ID org.opends.messages.core-750): The free space (1.77 gigabytes) on the disk containing directory "/" is below full threshold for the following subsystems: "Replication Changelog" (low=5.78 gigabytes, full=1.78 gigabytes), "userRoot Backend"

(low=5.78 gigabytes, full=1.78 gigabytes). Write operations to the backend, replication updates included, will fail until the free space rises above the threshold.
