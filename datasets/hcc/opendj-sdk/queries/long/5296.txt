In the reference document, the sample that shows how to back up user data in the offline mode misses the option "–offline" (see https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/ds/reference)/index.html#backup-1

Currently, it's:
$ backup --backupAll --backupDirectory /path/to/opendj/bak

Expected is:
$ backup --backupAll --backupDirectory /path/to/opendj/bak --offline
 
I guess it's the same for the "restore" command.
