When using some tools, you need to export old enviromental variable
OPENDS_JAVA_HOME instead of OPENDJ_JAVA_HOME

For example:


	Install OPENDJ
./setup
error message: OPENDJ_JAVA_HOME not set!




	OK, I export the needed variable
export OPENDJ_JAVA_HOME=/path-to-java-home
./setup
(works!)




	I want to configure replication
bin/dsreplication
error message: OPENDJ_JAVA_HOME not set!




	I don 't get it, I ve just exported OPENDJ_JAVA_HOME variable
	I 'll try the old one
export OPENDS_JAVA_HOME=/path-to-java-home
bin/dsreplication
(works!)
