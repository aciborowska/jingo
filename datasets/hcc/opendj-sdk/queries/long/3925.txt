Found with opendj 4.0.0 final build (rev 95c3fd4549c)

Scenario:


	we set up 2 servers with data
	we set up a proxy with these 2 servers defined as static primary servers, LB affinity and route all to true
	perform ldapsearch with target dn being user uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

./PROXY1/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h dj-robot-linux.internal.forgerock.com -p 1392 -D "cn=myself" -w password -b "uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" "(objectclass=*)" 


	we retrieve the server used for this search and loop on other users to try and reach the second server:

./PROXY1/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h dj-robot-linux.internal.forgerock.com -p 1392 -D "cn=myself" -w password -b "uid=user.x,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" "(objectclass=*)" 


but all requests go to the same server.



The behaviour has changed since it used to balance the load between both servers before this final build.
