Spotted while working on OPENDJ-6209.
To reproduce, run opendj-ldapass with this revision .
See readme file  to know how to run opendj-ldapass.

In the Grafana dashboard , the Garbage Collections panel references the following metric names which seemed to be no longer exposed by DS:

	﻿ds_jvm_garbage_collector_ps_marksweep_count
	﻿ds_jvm_garbage_collector_ps_scavenge_count



A quick look at the metrics collected by Prometheus shown that DS now expose ds_jvm_garbage_collector_mark_sweep_compact_count and seemed to no longer expose a metric for scavenge.
As JvmMonitorProvider class which is reponsible to expose metrics for the JVM uses java.lang.management.ManagementFactory#getGarbageCollectorMXBeans() to collect GC metrics, the difference is probably due to the Java version used for running opendj-ldapass (11).
