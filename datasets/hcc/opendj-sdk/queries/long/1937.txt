Steps to reproduce according to Ludo:


	create a replication topology with change log enabled everywhere
	apply some updates
	verify that the changeNumber is > 0 across all replicas and in sync
	add a new replica and initialize it
	perform some more updates
	problem: changeNumber on new replica is not in sync with changeNumber on other replicas.
