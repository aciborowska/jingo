Found on dev branch (revision 11330).

The status command returns errors on stdout and not on stderr.

Scenario:
************
1. unzip the server (don't configure it)
2. run the status command

$ ./opendj/bin/status
The version of the installed OpenDJ could not be determined because the
version file '/tmp/opendj/config/buildinfo' could not be found. Restore it from 
backup before continuing

$ ./opendj/bin/status 2>/dev/null
The version of the installed OpenDJ could not be determined because the
version file '/tmp/opendj/config/buildinfo' could not be found. Restore it from 
backup before continuing



=> the error message is expected but on stdout
