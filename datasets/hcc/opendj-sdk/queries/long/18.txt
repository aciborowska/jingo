I'm running the setup program and attempting to import a certificate/key pair that I've created from my local CA. I have the cert/key in both p12 and JKS files and I've NOT set a password on the key. 'setup' is prompting for me to provide the PIN for the key and it will not accept a blank password. After 7 attempts is exists. The setup program should allow an empty password when attempting to import the p12 or JKS files.
