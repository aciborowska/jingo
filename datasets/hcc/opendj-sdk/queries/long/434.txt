Default OpenDJ has search limit of 1000 for anon, and paged results not allowed for anon.
I enabled paged results for anon, then tried doing a paged search with limit of 1000.
Result is that I get 1000 entries and then:
SEARCH operation failed
Result Code:  4 (Size Limit Exceeded)
Additional Information:  This search operation has sent the maximum of 1000 entries to the client
1000

Seems like an off-by-one here. ou=crap999 has 999 entries, crap1000 has 1000, crap1001 has 1001 entries. Searches done with pagesize=1000:

% ldapsearch -h arkiv -p 1389 --simplePageSize=1000 -b ou=crap999,dc=cs,dc=umu,dc=se uid=* uid | grep -c ^uid
The simple paged results response control was not found in the search result done message from the server
Result Code:  93 (Control Not Found)
999
% ldapsearch -h arkiv -p 1389 --simplePageSize=1000 -b ou=crap1000,dc=cs,dc=umu,dc=se uid=* uid | grep -c ^uid

1000
% ldapsearch -h arkiv -p 1389 --simplePageSize=1000 -b ou=crap1001,dc=cs,dc=umu,dc=se uid=* uid | grep -c ^uid

1000

And the same, but with pagesize=999:

% ldapsearch -h arkiv -p 1389 --simplePageSize=999 -b ou=crap999,dc=cs,dc=umu,dc=se uid=* uid | grep -c ^uid
999
% ldapsearch -h arkiv -p 1389 --simplePageSize=999 -b ou=crap1000,dc=cs,dc=umu,dc=se uid=* uid | grep -c ^uid
1000
% ldapsearch -h arkiv -p 1389 --simplePageSize=999 -b ou=crap1001,dc=cs,dc=umu,dc=se uid=* uid | grep -c ^uid
1001

If max is 1000, and I send a request that will give me 1000 (but not more), then I would not expect an error saying it can't send more than 1000.
