All statistics value under MBean "org.opends.server:Name=rootDSE,Rdn1=cn-monitor" have type of "String", instead of "Number". e.g.

cn-LDAP_Connection_Handler_0000_port_50389_Staticstics/connectionsEstablished

Some of the stats are useful to be monitored constantly. Since the value type is "String", many JMX monitoring tools has difficulty to represent the stats in a dashboard.
