Found with 6.0.0 rev f0742489655

In our tests for commons config use of tokens, we have a test which sets a token for listen-port of http connection handler and we give it no value (nothing set in environment or system properties):


./DJ1/opendj/bin/dsconfig --offline set-connection-handler-prop --handler-name "HTTP Connection Handler" --set listen-port:&{fake.port}



Then we start the server to see the error message:

./DJ1/opendj/bin/start-ds

...

The error message is clear but the stack trace is not necessary.
Could you please remove it?
