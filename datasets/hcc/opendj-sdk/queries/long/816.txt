Trying an ACI like the following in test purpose...
aci: (version 3.0; acl "TEST"; deny (all) (ssf < "1")

I have no access what so ever on the branch with this aci on it. I have tried with:

	no encryption on the LDAP Connection Handler
	TLS on the LDAP Connection Handler
	SSL on the LDAPS Connection Handler



no encryption, TLS and SSL works flawless. But this ACI seems to not work... It seems the ACI evaluates to "0" no matter what and do a deny always. Changing the ACI to....

aci: (version 3.0; acl "TEST"; deny (all) (ssf > "1")

make this branch in the DIT to be visible all the time no matter if I use encryption or not.


Is this a bug?

A workaround for me could be to disable non encryption directly on the "LDAP Connection handler". Is that possible? I want to be able to use SSL and TLS only except on loopback and from management network.
