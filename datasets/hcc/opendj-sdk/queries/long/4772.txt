https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/ds/release-notes/index.html#software-downloads shows the wrong name for the RPM: opendj--1.noarch.rpm.

Should probably be opendj-6.0.0-SNAPSHOT-1.noarch.rpm, though I also notice there are no nightly builds for RPM and DEBs at https://ea.forgerock.com/nightlies/opendj/.
