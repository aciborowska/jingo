There appears to have been a regression in REST to LDAP. Due to a bug in the doc tests, I didn't notice the problem until replaying examples manually in an effort to update the docs for OPENDJ-6980.

There appears to be an internal problem reading groups. If you set up a server with the ds-evaluation profile, you can reproduce it like this:

$ o
{
  "code" : 500,
  "reason" : "Internal Server Error",
  "message" : "/: Expecting a List"
} 

I don't see any additional information in the logs.
