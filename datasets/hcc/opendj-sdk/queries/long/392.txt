The Default Password Policy has been modified as noted below.  


ds-cfg-max-password-age: 90 days
ds-cfg-min-password-age: 1 days



However, this also affects the openssouser and ldapuser accounts created by OpenAM.  I have tried overriding these attributes with another password policy (e.g. ds-cfg-max-password-age: 0 seconds), but the attribute values are not respected.  

I have also tried creating a subentry as noted in http://opendj.forgerock.org/doc/admin-guide/OpenDJ-Admin-Guide.html#chap-pwd-policy but the ldapsearch still returns the Default Password Policy.  

I would expect setting the pwdPolicySubentry would override the default.
