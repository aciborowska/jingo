The '–quiet' option for the CLI tools is quite inconsistent.

In dsconfig, the option can only be used if the '--no-prompt ' option is present, wich is not the case for other tools.

In dsreplication, we can use the option without '--no-prompt', but whenever we need to specify some parameter the question doesn't get printed, so it is unusable for the most part.

Some of the tools are missing the option for their respective counterpart (import-ldif has it, export-ldif doesn't), and most of the tools are missing the option completely. 

We should decide on the purpose of this option, and unify the behavior across all (or groups of) the CLI tools.
