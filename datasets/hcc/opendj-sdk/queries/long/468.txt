I get an error when upgrading from OpenDS 2.0.0 to OpenDJ 2.4.5.  I've run opendj_patch4upgrade.sh as directed, but my version, i.e.,5492, is less than the minimum version supported by the patch, i.e, 6311.  Also, the patch doesn't address my particular error.

The message that I receive when running ./upgrade -f OpenDJ-2.4.5.zip follows:

Applying Schema Customizations ..... Schema Migration Error

	Apologies if I've missed something in the documentation, but I've been unable to find any information on this error.
