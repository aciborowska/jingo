I was trying to reproduce issue OPENDJ-2699 with the current build of 4.0.0 from the master.
With the current state of OpenDJ 4.0 snapshots, I cannot add any new objectClass to the server. The control panel fails with the following error :


The provided name 'myOwnOC' already exists in the schema (defined as syntax).
The provided OID '999.999.1.0' already exists in the schema (defined as syntax).


See attached png.
No request was sent to the server to try to create the new object class.
