Due to the optimistic nature of PDB, concurrent transactions modifying the same keys are rolled back. The transaction is then re-started in the hope that this time no other transaction will update the same key. This process is repeated until the transaction is successfully committed.

Those rollback and retry mechanisms add a lot of pressure on the DB and to the CPU which might lead to problems at run-time and during DB recovery.
