Customers are selecting the "Global Access Control Policy" (option 16) thinking they can create/view/delete Global ACIs for a DS instance using this option. If they then try hit "Create a new Global Access Control Policy" or any other options and pretty nondescript error returns and the dsconfig application exits:


"DSEE Compatible Access Control Handler" component type cannot be used with
subcommand {set-global-access-control-policy-prop}


It appears this option is specific to DS Proxy instances. Hence both the options and errors should be made more descriptive to illustrate this. Dsconfig should also not exit on selecting this option.
