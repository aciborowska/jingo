1. Create a simple dc=example,dc=com directory with say  5 default users (user.0, ... user.5)

2. Create the following aci


dn: ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
replace: aci
aci: (targattrfilters="add=uid:(uid=owner-*)")    (version 3.0; acl "testcase-aci";   deny (add,write)     userdn = "ldap:///anyone"     ; )
aci: (targetattr="+||*")    (version 3.0; acl "testcase-admin-aci";   allow (all,import,export)     userdn = "ldap:///uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"     ; )



3. Try to rename user.2 to user.20 



dn: uid=user.2,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modrdn
newrdn: uid=user.20
deleteoldrdn: 1
newsuperior: ou=people,dc=example,dc=com



one gets



Result Code:  50 (Insufficient Access Rights)
Additional Information:  The entry uid=user.2,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com cannot be renamed due to insufficient access rights



The issue seems to be due to this ACI



aci: (targattrfilters="add=uid:(uid=owner-*)")    (version 3.0; acl "testcase-aci";   deny (add,write)     userdn = "ldap:///anyone"     ; )



Even if the targattrfilters are changed to anything else,
the access is denied. It seems that this aci is applied
for modrdn especially compared to normal operations. (
Normal individual ldap operation like create new users
works and also those with the deny targattrfilters works
as expected)

Ref: http://opendj.forgerock.org/doc/admin-guide/index/chap-privileges-acis.html is check but this behaviour does not sound right.
(Checked OPENDJ-895 but this looks a bit different from that too).
