The problem is only in the number of entries in the output of status command or dsreplication status and also GUI. Under backend are all entries - confirmed with ldapsearch and --countEntries and with GUI manager -> Manage Entries.

Scenario
This is related only to new backend

	Install OpenDJ 3.0.0 with attached ldif file
	Provide ldapdelete operation on subtree like:

./ldapdelete -h ondrej-profiq -p 3389 -D "cn=myself" -w password --deleteSubtree
ou=test_branch,dc=example,dc=com


	./status  => Entries 2  | the wrong number of entries is also presented in GUI
	./ldapsearch with filter "(objectclass=*)"  and --countEntries result 202



Note the total number of entries before subtree delete is 404 and after we delete half of total number of entries we should have 202.
