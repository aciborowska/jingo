When an extension is loaded, ConfigurationFramework logs information about the extension as an error, whereas it should be a notice.

Result is an ugly message, for example when running dsconfig:

SEVERE: Loaded extension from file '.../OpenDJ/lib/extensions/openidm-account-change-plugin-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar' (build 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT, revision 4df1cb7eb543caa513d76fb824168bc82f5cde55)
