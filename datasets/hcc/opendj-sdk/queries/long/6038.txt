supportextract shows an error when listing security stores:


- Listing the security stores
  * config/keystore
  * db/ads-truststore/ads-truststore
  * db/ads-truststore/ads-truststore
Other: duplicate entry: support-data/config/security/ads-truststore-list
  * db/ads-truststore/ads-truststore



I haven't investigated enough to know whether data is missing in the archive as a result of this error.
