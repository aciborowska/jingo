Client side timeouts cause all requests to be abandoned.

Currently, we make an exception for persistent searches, but we should also have special treatment for bind and startTLS requests as well. In particular, a bind or startTLS request cannot be abandoned (RFC 4511 # 4.11) or cancelled (RFC 3909), and the only viable course of action in the case of a timeout is to fail the connection entirely. Furthermore, a bind or startTLS operation changes the state of the connection (bindOrStartTLSInProgress) in order to prevent other operations from being performed.
