Since OPENDJ-3860 resolution, access control handler can be deleted with dsconfig.
When the configuration has no ACH set or when the ACH is disabled (as it was possible before OPENDJ-3860 resolution) with dsconfig, the DefaultAccessControlHandler is internally used.
This handler is implemented using the null object pattern and relies on AccessControlHandler implementation which allow access to everything and anyone by default.
This is not such a bid deal in practice since such kind of radical change is often done when the server is offline but still represents a vector of attack.

Acceptance criteria:
This issue can be closed once when the ACH is disabled or removed, server deny all access unless the user has the bypass acl privilege.

Code consideration:
An approach as been suggested by Matt in this PR comment thread :


	override all missing methods in PolicyBasedAccessControlHandler to return true (allow)
	make AccessControlHandler non-abstract and remove DefaultAccessControlHandler
	make AccessControlHandler return false for everything (deny)



Note that since this is a behavior change, some unit tests will need to be updated.
