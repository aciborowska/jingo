Found with 7.1.0-SNAPSHOT rev. 792ed6eb467.

Reproducible with test:

python3 run-pybot.py -v -s replication_group3.mediumConsistency -t Remove_One_Server_From_Topology DJ


Test steps

With 2 servers (DSRS mode) DJ1 and DJ2:

	do 100 mods on DJ1
	check changenumber is stable on DJ1 => expect changenumber == 100
	do 100 mods on DJ2
	check changenumber is stable on DJ1 => expect changenumber == 200
	stop DJ1 and remove DJ2 from DJ1's bootstrap servers
	on DJ2 disable Multimaster Synchronization provider
	on DJ2 delete replication domain from Multimaster Synchronization and after delete the provider
	start DJ1
	do 100 mods on DJ1
	check changenumber is stable on DJ1 => expect changenumber == 300



Step 10. fails because the changeNumber is 200.

The test was working before mentioned revision.Â
