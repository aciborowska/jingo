Given the following /etc/hosts file where ldap.example.com is not an alias of localhost:

127.0.0.1       localhost
<eth0-ip>       ldap.example.com

If replication on the server ldap.example.com is configured for ldap.example.com then, under some circumstances, the replication server will try to connect to itself. This is because it fails to detect that ldap.example.com is an address for the local machine.
