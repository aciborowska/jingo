Steps to reproduce:

	Install OpenDJ 2.6.2 on OSX
	Try to upgrade to 3.5.0



As part of the upgrade process, OpenDJ does this:


  Removing old OpenDJ library files...................................   100%     



Which would be great in general, but it actually is removing the JAR files for the new version.

Since OSX uses a case insensitive file system that is case preserving, when the new version's opendj.zip gets extracted, it will override the contents of the OpenDJ.zip, but the name will remain all uppercase.

Workaround: manually copy the opendj*.jar files from the new OpenDJ version's ZIP file.
