This is an issue reproduced by the customer, but so far, have not been able to reproduce in house. At best, could reproduce the behaviour observed in OPENDJ-3283. This case differs, as they say that restarting the servers never clears up the logs.

The configuration : 2 x OpenAM 12 OOTB +  site configuration with session failover configured; CTS, configuration and user store hosted in the embedded OpenDJ. They report reproducing the issue by exercising traffic (login sessions) to the servers (they use JMeter), and by restarting one server every 10 minutes. After some while, the JE logs start to grow - that is - the number of zero occupancy logs are augmenting without being cleared, even after restarting servers.

Apparently setting the parameter : ds-cfg-db-checkpointer-bytes-interval to 100Mb, the issue goes away (e.g the logs are cleaned at stop/start).

The JMeter file is attached - but not sure if this can be used.
