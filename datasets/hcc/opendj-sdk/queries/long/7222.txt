To re-create issue, set up lastLoginTime as instructed in the documentation.

https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/6.5/admin-guide/index.html#example-track-last-login

According to config reference, last-login-time-format is "Any valid format string that can be used with the java.text.SimpleDateFormat class."

https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/6.5/configref/index.html#objects-password-policy-last-login-time-format

According to Oracle Java documentation,

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html

the date-time format pattern of yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ is a valid pattern.  However, when this pattern is used for last-login-time-format...



ds-cfg-last-login-time-format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ



the following error is encountered



opendj; bin /$ ./ldapsearch -p 4389 -D "uid=ckent,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" -w welcome -b "dc=example,dc=com" uid=* dn

Reported in an older ticket for version 3.5.3, here is another example of what should be a valid pattern that yields a similar error.
