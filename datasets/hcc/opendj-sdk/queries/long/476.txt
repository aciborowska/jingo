I have an entry: uid=demo,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
if I execute this command:
opendj/bin/manage-account set-account-is-disabled -h localhost -p 4444 -O false -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w secret -b uid=demo,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
then everything works fine, but if I use uid=demo,dc=example,dc=com, then it fails with this message:


The server was unable to decode the response message from the server:  Cannot
decode the provided ASN.1 sequence as an LDAP message because the second
element of the sequence could not be decoded as the protocol op:
org.opends.server.types.LDAPException: Cannot decode the provided ASN.1
element as an LDAP result protocol op because the second element in the result
sequence could not be decoded as the matched DN:
java.lang.NullPointerException (id=2293808)



Note: when I used uid=demo,ou=people,dc=example,dc=co then it was showing the error correctly...

Other subcommands could be affected as well, haven't tested them.
