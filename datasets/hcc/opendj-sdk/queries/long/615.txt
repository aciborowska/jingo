Create ds1 and ds2.

Create "cn=Strict Password Policy,cn=Password Policies,cn=config" on ds1.

Create some entries, and make them refer to the strict policy using ds-pwp-password-policy-dn.

Enable replication, initialize from ds1 to ds2.

intialize will report that it has processed all the entries. However replication log on ds2 will report a fewer number of entries, and on inspection it is missing all the new entries referring to the strict policy.

dsreplication status (on ds1 and ds2) report differing numbers of entries, but no missing changes.

There's no logging anywhere to indicate anything's been skipped.

Creating an identically named strict policy on ds2 and reinitialising, correctly adds the AWOL entries.
