Found with OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev (ce72bcc1d86)

Scenario:

We setup a server with some data and 2 other servers.
We enable replication between server 1 and server 2, then server 1 and server 3.
We initialize all then modify an entry to have a new superior:


${INSTANCE1}/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p ${INSTANCE1_LDAP_PORT} -D ${INSTANCE1_ROOT_DN} -w ${INSTANCE1_ROOT_PWD}  <<END_OF_COMMAND_INPUT
dn: uid=abergin,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: moddn
newrdn: uid=abergin
deleteoldrdn: 1
newsuperior: ou=Special Users, dc=example, dc=com
END_OF_COMMAND_INPUT



We check that we have the same content on the 3 nodes but it fails, the change does not seem to be replicated.
