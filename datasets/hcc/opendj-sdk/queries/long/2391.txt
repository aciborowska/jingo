To reproduce the issue you need opendj server 3.0.0 SNAPSHOT with pdb backend.

The problem raises, when you try to dump storage tree with maxKeyValue (-K).

From my investigation this option is ignored, because when I tried to run the command with maxKeyValue 23, the tool prints a number of total records equal to 1048.

./backendtool dump-storage-tree -n userRoot -t /dc=com/entryUUID.uuidMatch -K 23 -q

Total Records: 1048
Total / Average Key Size: 37728 bytes / 36 bytes
Total / Average Data Size: 3017 bytes / 2 bytes


on the other hand, when I tried with minKeyValue 24, the tool prints number of total records equal to 897.

./backendtool dump-storage-tree -n userRoot -t /dc=com/entryUUID.uuidMatch -k 24 -q

Total Records: 897
Total / Average Key Size: 32292 bytes / 36 bytes
Total / Average Data Size: 2583 bytes / 2 bytes


When I run the tool without -k or -K the total number of records was 1048.
From my point of view this is not possible.

Same behavior for subcommand dump-tree.
