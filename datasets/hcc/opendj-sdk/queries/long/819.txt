If you malform the -Y argument you get an ASN.1 decode failure.


$bin/ldapmodify -h laptop.local -p 1389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w secret12 -Y "cn=test1,dc=example,dc=com"
dn: cn=test2,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
add: description
description: test1 was here
-

Processing MODIFY request for cn=test2,dc=example,dc=com
MODIFY operation failed
Result Code:  2 (Protocol Error)
Additional Information:  Cannot decode the provided proxied authorization V2 control because an error occurred while attempting to decode the control value:  Cannot decode the ASN.1 octet string element of because an unexpected end of file was reached while reading value bytes (110) (id=2293769)



The argument needed a leading "dn:" in my example. Failing with a decode error is a bit unpleasant.
