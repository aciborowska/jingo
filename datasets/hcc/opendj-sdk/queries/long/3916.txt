Found using OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev 7559565571aa12d325cadeaeaeb9475fbd623e6f

Scenario
1. install 2 OpenDJ instances
2. enable replication
3. stop the first instance
4. update the 'schema/99-user.ldif' file on the first instance by adding a new objectclass
5. start the first instance
6. check the changes are correctly replicated
7. stop the first instance
8. update the 'schema/99-user.ldif' file on the first instance by deleting the objectclass
9. start the first instance
10. check the changes are correctly replicated
=> on the second instance the objectclass is correctly removed from the 99-user.ldif as expected
=> but on the first instance the objectclass is still here
