Now that we cannot use custom comparators, we must generate a normalized byte representation that sorts correctly. The following encoding should work:


	bit 0: sign bit, 0 = negative, 1 = positive
	bits 1-3: length of the encoded length in bytes (0 when length is < 2^4, 4 when length is < 2^32)
	bits 4-7: encoded length when length is < 2^4
	bits 4-15: encoded length when length is < 2^12
	bits 4-23: encoded length when length is < 2^20
	bits 4-31: encoded length when length is < 2^28
	bits 4-39: encoded length when length is < 2^32 (trailing 4 bits are 0)
	remaining: byte encoding of the absolute value of the integer.



When the value is negative all bits from bit 1 onwards are flipped.
