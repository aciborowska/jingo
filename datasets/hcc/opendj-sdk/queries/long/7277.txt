When running dsconfig interactively, the command exits if asked to display the config for the wrong access control handler:

# Set up a DS/RS and then run dsconfig interactively...
Enter choice: 15


>>>> Global Access Control Policy management menu

What would you like to do?

    1)  Create a new Global Access Control Policy
    2)  View and edit an existing Global Access Control Policy
    3)  Delete an existing Global Access Control Policy
    4)  List existing Global Access Control Policies

    a)  show advanced components and properties
    q)  quit
    b)  back

Enter choice [b]: 2
"DSEE Compatible Access Control Handler" component type cannot be used with
subcommand {set-global-access-control-policy-prop}
$ echo $?
2


A nice interactive behavior would be to display an error message, but continue the session.
