Found with 6.0.0 rev 295f8236b74

We setup a server with some data and some static groups.
We add a new user to the static group:


./DJ1/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1392 -D "cn=myself" -w password 	
dn: cn=my_staticgroup2,dc=groups,dc=com
changetype: modify
add: member
member: uid=user_11,ou=static,dc=groups,dc=com



Now we delete this user:

./DJ1/opendj/bin/ldapdelete -h localhost -p 1392 -D "uid=my_application,dc=groups,dc=com" -w pw_my_application --deleteSubtree "uid=user_11,ou=static,dc=groups,dc=com"



In the server logs, we get the following error message:

[27/Oct/2017:15:33:11 +0200] category=BACKEND severity=ERROR msgID=483 msg=An error occurred while reading from index /dc=com/objectClass.objectIdentifierMatch. The index seems to be corrupt and is now operating in a degraded state. The index must be rebuilt before it can return to normal operation
