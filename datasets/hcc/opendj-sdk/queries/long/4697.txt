The documentation such as https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/opendj/doc/admin-guide/index.html#configure-debug-logging shows steps to enable the debug logger before creating debug targets.

This is unfortunate, because the debug target acts as a filter. With no filters, debug logs contain all traces. For example, you start the server and get 59 MB of debug log before performing any other operations.

So the steps should be the other way around in the docs.
