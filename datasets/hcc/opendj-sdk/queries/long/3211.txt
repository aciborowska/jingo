The REST to LDAP gateway install documentation is not up to date with respect to the implementation. Both the draft and published versions need a rewrite:


	https://forgerock.org/opendj/doc/bootstrap/install-guide/index.html#install-rest2ldap-servlet
	https://backstage.forgerock.com/#!/docs/opendj/3/install-guide/chap-install#install-rest2ldap-servlet



The published version for 3.x might need to be split into two procedures, since the configuration has changed quite a bit in 3.x since 3.0.
