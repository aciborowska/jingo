Following the documented procedure to stop replication temporarily for a replica:

https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/opendj/3.5/admin-guide/#stop-repl-tmp
Warning
Do not allow modifications on the replica for which replication is disabled, as no record of such changes is kept, and the changes cause replication to diverge.
The warning implies that modifications on replicas for which replication is still enabled are OK, and will be replayed when replication is resumed.

This is not the case, mods to replicas that are still enabled will not be replayed to a replica that has been re-enabled.

 

Steps to reproduce:

	2 OpenDJ instances with replication enabled (DJ1 and DJ2)
	Disable replication temporarily on DJ2
	Add an entry to DJ1
	Enable replication on DJ2
	dsreplication status shows an additional entry on DJ1
	Entry added in step 3 is not replicated to DJ2



Observations:

Entry does exist in the changelog of both servers, however it is never replayed.

Cannot reproduce in OpenDJ 4.x using new dsreplication 
 suspend/resume commands. (https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/5/admin-guide/#chap-replication)

 

Workaround:

Re-init of server required after disabling replication temporarily
