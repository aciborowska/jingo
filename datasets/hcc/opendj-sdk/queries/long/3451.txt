Found with OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev 2daf3a6626ef94d75790b1e3a118c7cb350e1018

Since SDK and server tools have been merged, one of our aci test is failing.

	We setup a server
	import some data.
	we add an aci to allow a user to use getEffectiveRights
	we perform a search with this option and encounter an error:

${INSTANCE0}/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p ${INSTANCE0_LDAP_PORT} -D "uid=bob,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" -w ${INSTANCE0_ROOT_PWD} -b "ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" --getEffectiveRightsAuthzid "dn:" "(objectclass=*)" "uid="*"" aclRights aclRightsInfo
The LDAP search request failed: 84 (Decoding Error)
Additional Information:  The attribute description
"aclRightsInfo;logs;attributeLevel;search;uid=*" could not be parsed because
it contains an invalid character "*" at position 45





See script in attachment to reproduce.
