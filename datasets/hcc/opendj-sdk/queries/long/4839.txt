Found with rev e1b7f368cc1.

In our test for disk use threshold, we set up a replication topology of 2 servers.
We set the disk-low-threshold on DJ1 to  (free disk space + 2) Gb for the replication:

./DJ1/opendj/bin/dsconfig -h nameserver.example.com -p 4444 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X set-replication-server-prop --provider-name "Multimaster Synchronization" --set disk-low-threshold:"256 gb" --advanced -n



Then we check that we have a warning about the low threshold being reached.
We add an entry to check it appears in changelog of both servers.

Then we set the full threshold on DJ1 so that it is reached and check we have a warning about it telling that the replication server will disconnect:


/DJ1/opendj/bin/dsconfig -h nameserver.example.com -p 4444 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X set-replication-server-prop --provider-name "Multimaster Synchronization" --set disk-full-threshold:"255 gb" --advanced -n



We add entry in DJ2, check it does not appear in the changelog of DJ1.
Then we set the thresholds to some lower values and expect the replication server to connect and catch up.

Yet, DJ1 and DJ2 's changelogs are not in sync, even after 1mn.

This test used to work.
