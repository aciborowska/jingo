In the non-regression tests for docs, there is a test with the name "try persistent search". The test corresponds to https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/opendj/doc/dev-guide/index.html#persistent-search.

Although the example is not necessarily wrong, the test does not run to completion.

The test was apparently passing accidentally. The test needs to be fixed so that it completes properly when run in the https://github.com/sstephenson/bats framework with bash -c.
