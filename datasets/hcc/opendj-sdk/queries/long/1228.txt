When the server starts, or when schema gets updated, the server builds a file with all schema elements to facilitate the detection of offline changes, as well as upgrade.
However, the server will try to load any files from the config/schema directory and not just the .ldif files like the SchemaConfigManager.
We should make sure that any place the schema directory is scanned for files, only .ldif files are being evaluated and loaded.
