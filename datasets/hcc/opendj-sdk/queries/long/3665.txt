As described in OPENDJ-836, when you use --httpPort to enable (cleartext) HTTP access, the /api endpoint is not enabled, but you can get access to the configuration endpoint.

This makes the config REST endpoint less secure than access over dsconfig, which by default uses a secure connection.

An alternative would be not to enable access to the config over HTTP by default, but only over HTTPS by default. In other words, you'd get access with setup --httpsPort but not with setup --httpPort.
