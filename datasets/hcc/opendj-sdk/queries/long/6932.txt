A new feature in DS 6.5 is being able to externally read cn=changelog from a replication only server (RS). Previously a DS+RS instance was required to do this. The documentation does not cover this well for a split DS only, RS only topology:

To Enable the External Change Log

DS directory servers and replication servers both publish an external change log. A server that publishes a change log must replicate the suffix whose changes you want logged.
 

It should clarify that DS directory servers that are combined DS+RS, and replication only servers both publish an external change log to cn=changelog, once replication is configured for a suffix. a DS with no replication server does not host a changelog.
 
Another consideration is that an RS only instance does not usually expose any external LDAP connection handlers as RS do not have any data backends (a connection handler is not a replication server setup option).

It is required to enable an LDAP/LDAPS connection handler on an RS so that it is possible to externally read cn=changelog after the initial setup, using dsconfig:
