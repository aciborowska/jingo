Found with rev (5a25b0834dc)

Since the new default root user, we have a regression in our proxy tests where we create a second proxy backend and then deletes it.
After deletion, the proxy is not reachable with root user:


./PROXY1/opendj/bin/dsconfig -h localhost -p 4450 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X delete-backend --backend-name "proxy2" -n 	

The Backend was deleted successfully

./PROXY1/opendj/bin/dsconfig -h localhost -p 4450 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X delete-service-discovery-mechanism --mechanism-name "MiscTest" -n 	

Tool version '7.0.0' does not match remote server version 'Unknown'. Please
use the same tool version as the server one



To reproduce:

./run-pybot.py -s proxy_group.Misc -t second_proxy_backend  opendj
