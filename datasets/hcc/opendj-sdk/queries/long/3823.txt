The interactive setup now asks the user which type of backend they would like to use. The list includes the PDB backend which is deprecated but does not warn the user to avoid this choice.

Suggested fix: interactive mode should not allow users to select "advanced" backend types or, if it does, it should at least provide a description of the PDB backend which at least warns the user that the backend is deprecated.

Offending message is INFO_SETUP_INTERACTIVE_PDB_BACKEND in quickSetup.properties: "PDB (alternative to JE under Apache 2.0 license)".
