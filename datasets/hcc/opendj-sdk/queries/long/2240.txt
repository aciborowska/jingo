The following value fails the parser in the SDK/opendj-core:


attributeTypes: ( foo-oid NAME 'foo' EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch ORDERING caseIgnoreOrderingMatch SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 USAGE userApplications)



Note there is no space between "userApplications" and the RPAREN.

This seems to be permitted by RFC 4512. The relevant fragments of ABNF are as follows:


     AttributeTypeDescription = LPAREN WSP
         numericoid                    ; object identifier
         [ SP "NAME" SP qdescrs ]      ; short names (descriptors)
         [ SP "DESC" SP qdstring ]     ; description
         [ SP "OBSOLETE" ]             ; not active
         [ SP "SUP" SP oid ]           ; supertype
         [ SP "EQUALITY" SP oid ]      ; equality matching rule
         [ SP "ORDERING" SP oid ]      ; ordering matching rule
         [ SP "SUBSTR" SP oid ]        ; substrings matching rule
         [ SP "SYNTAX" SP noidlen ]    ; value syntax
         [ SP "SINGLE-VALUE" ]         ; single-value
         [ SP "COLLECTIVE" ]           ; collective
         [ SP "NO-USER-MODIFICATION" ] ; not user modifiable
         [ SP "USAGE" SP usage ]       ; usage
         extensions WSP RPAREN         ; extensions

     usage = "userApplications"     /  ; user
             "directoryOperation"   /  ; directory operational
             "distributedOperation" /  ; DSA-shared operational
             "dSAOperation"            ; DSA-specific operational
      extensions = *( SP xstring SP qdstrings )
      SP      = 1*SPACE  ; one or more " "
      WSP     = 0*SPACE  ; zero or more " "



So "userApplications" can be followed by no extensions, no whitespace and then RPAREN.

The parser in the server code looks like it gets this right.
