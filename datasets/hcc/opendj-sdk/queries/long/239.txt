I was trying to test OpenDJ server Password Policy State Extended Operation, and found that the test program was failing on the second extended operation done on the same connection, with the following error message: Operations Error: Bind or Start TLS operation in progress.
The error message is incorrect as there was no other pending operation. Beside, the error message is not an OpenDJ server message, as the 2nd request is not even seen by the server.
