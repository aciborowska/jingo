Using round-robin, least-requests or affinity (in least-requests behaviour) load-balancing algorithms the following issue is experienced:

if you have load balancing between 4 servers, S1, S2, S3, and S4, where S1 has failed, the load balancing algorithm loops like this: S2, S2, S3, S4, S2, S2, S3, S4, S2, S2, ...? 

A more natural sequence could be: S2, S3, S4, S2, S3, S4...
