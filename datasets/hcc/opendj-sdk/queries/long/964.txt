"Static group entries can take the standard object class groupOfNames where each member attribute value is a distinguished name of an entry, or groupOfUniqueNames where each uniqueMember attribute value is also a DN, but no uniqueMember value is repeated."

The last part implies that member values can be repeated. They can't; all values of an attribute must always be distinct.

uniqueMember values aren't just DNs, they're DNs with an optional associated bitstring (bizarre, but this is for historical reasons) value which are intended to be used to disambiguate entries that are deleted and then recreated.
