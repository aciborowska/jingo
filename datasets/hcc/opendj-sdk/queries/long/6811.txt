The docs tests had an example of an online restore command with --start 0 to schedule the operation. The test immediately following shut down the server with stop-ds.

During the opendj-docs test run the morning of Nov. 19, 2019, the stop-ds command in this case started hanging, causing the doc tests to run until the timeout. (This went unnoticed originally because the job was not configured to fail on timeout. I've since fixed that.)

Although the use case is a bit contrived, because you probably would not start an immediate restore task and then stop the server, the doc tests were passing before. So this looks like a regression, or at least a change in behavior.
