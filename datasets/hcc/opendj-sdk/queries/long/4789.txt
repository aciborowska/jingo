In OpenIDM, we found a regression raised in OPENIDM-10221 for ScriptedCrest and ScriptedRest samples.
This regression happens when using DJ M118 (works OK with M117)

To reproduce the error from IDM using PyForge:


./run-pybot.py --test scripted_rest_with_dj OpenIDM


It fails on this statement:


${json} =  get_idm_json  system/scriptedrest/group/group1


so changing it to :


${json} =  get_idm_json  system/scriptedrest/group/group1  expected_status=0
sleep  1000


should allow you to see DJ status just after the failure

When we do some REST request directly to DJ:


curl -v --header "Content-type: application/json" -u idm:password "http://localhost:8090/api/groups?_queryFilter=_id%20eq%20%22group1%22"
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8090 (#0)
* Server auth using Basic with user 'idm'

{"result":[],"resultCount":0,"pagedResultsCookie":null,"totalPagedResultsPolicy":"NONE","totalPagedResults":-1,"remainingPagedResults":-1}%


=> this is OK, but sometimes we get 500 instead of 200
