I was notified of a docs issue with https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/6/install-guide/#upgrade-paths via KB feedback, so am passing this on to you - can you contact Ashley Hale if you require any further info:
The section seems similar or close in DS 5.0, but here we give paths in DS 6 (https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/6/install-guide/#upgrade-paths)
Table 8.1. Server Upgrade Paths.


	May need to include a caveat or NOTE: to the effect to upgrade to DS6+ from releases older than DS 5+; upgrade from say OpenDJ 2.6-3.5.x to DS 5+ first, then upgrade from DS 5+ to DS6+ and they should be good to go!



As we've learned in this case, there appears to be a hard limit on how far customers can upgrade old OpenDJ Servers to newer releases. 

As Lee reports: 
All tests I've conducted using DJ 3.5.0 or even 3.5.3 fail when I try to configure replication from the DS6 side.

We only support replication of DJ/DS instances via Rolling Upgrades ... 

You cannot install a new DS6 instance and expect to configure replication from the start with any OpenDJ instances versions 2.6-3.5.x.

If the original instances were DS 5.0 and higher, then you can install a new DS6 instance and configure replication to the DS5+ instance.
