Using the documented combination of "dsreplication pre-external-initialization" "restore" and "dsreplication post-external-initialization" to create a new replica works, however any changes made between the backup and post-external-initialization fail to sync to the new replica.

It is not clear if this is a defect in our code or documentation. The original documentation for OpenDS 2.2 at http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19476-01/821-0506/changing-the-data-set.html suggests this technique can only be used to initialize all the replicas in a topology.
