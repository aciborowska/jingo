The importer mechanism added in 3.0 does not automatically clear the backend files if the backend only contains one base-dn. This is a regression.
The impact is that each import without --clearBackend will actually remove the database from the storage. Because this operation is done lazily (at least, on JE) the disk could still contains the deleted data at the moment the import start, increasing the disk usage uselessly.
