Found with 7.0.0 rev. dff8e8c089e. 
 When trying to create a replication server with dsconfig interactive we are forced to set a bootstrap-server property now. Which is ok but the message says:

The Replication Server could not be created because the following mandatory
property was not defined:

    Property          Syntax
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    bootstrap-server  HOST:PORT - A host name followed by a ":" and a port
                      number.

Would you like to edit the properties of the Replication Server again in order
to resolve this problem? (yes / no) [yes]: 


There is no such property in replication-server, so it is not obvious where a user should set this property. Usually there is a redirection to proper config section or at least a message complaining that property under specific config entry is not set.

NOTE: 
 The property is now on global level Replication Synchronization Provider: "Multimaster Synchronization" and must be set before creating replication server, because it's inherited.o* further formatting is done here

From my point of view the fix should mention the Synchronization Provider and the property name to set.
