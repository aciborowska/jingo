In REST2LDAP, a resource (such as "example-v1") contains subResources (such as "users", "groups"). The subResources are typed (e.g. "frapi:opendj:rest2ldap:user:1.0")

SubResources can themselves contain subResources. There is documentation describing this, but it is quite hard to understand - perhaps in part because you think you're reading the docs for the normal resource/subResources section.

Map of subresource names to subresource definitions.

The subresource names are URL templates. A URL template sets the relative URL template beneath which the subresources are located. If empty, the subresources are located directly beneath the parent resource.

URL templates can set variables in braces {}. Any URL template variables will be substituted into the DN template.

For example, suppose LDAP entries for devices are located under the following base DNs:


	ou=others,ou=devices,dc=example,dc=com
[etc]



In the actual configuration, you'd end up with something like this:



"frapi:opendj:rest2ldap:devices:1.0": {
  "subResources": {
    "others": {
      "type": "collection",
      "dnTemplate": "", // not sure about this value
[...]



which is definitely not where I was expecting to configure sub-subResources.

Would a more fleshed out example help?
