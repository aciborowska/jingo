To reproduce:

1) Install DJ with PDB backend
2) Run an addrate against the server
3) After a few minutes, set the system clock backwards between 30seconds or a few minutes

Results:

Should be very immediate and very severe. Depending on how long I wait and how far back I set the clock I get symptoms ranging from unresponsive server, to runaway journal file generation in my backend directory and almost always I will see the server run out of memory.

Expected results:

The server should be a lot more resilient to a clock change like this. Using a JE backend gives much more stable results.
