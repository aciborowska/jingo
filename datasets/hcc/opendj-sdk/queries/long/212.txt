The following message should say something like "download and install OpenDMK" rather than the following.

$ dsconfig -p 4444 -h `hostname` -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password create-connection-handler --handler-name "SNMP Connection Handler" --type snmp --set enabled:true --set listen-port:11161 --set trap-port:11162 -X -n 
The SNMP Connection Handler could not be created because of the following
reason:


	[LDAP: error code 53 - The Directory Server is unwilling to add
       configuration entry cn=SNMP Connection Handler,cn=connection
       handlers,cn=config because one of the add listeners registered with the
       parent entry cn=connection handlers,cn=config rejected this change with
       the message: The SNMP Connection Handler could not be decoded due to the
       following reason: The string value
       "org.opends.server.snmp.SNMPConnectionHandler" is not a valid value for
       the "java-class" property, which must have the following syntax: CLASS
       <= org.opends.server.api.ConnectionHandler]
