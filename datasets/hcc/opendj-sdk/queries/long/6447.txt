Regression spotted with daily test on 5.5.3-SNAPSHOT rev.Â 2f0db9cb877.

During unconfiguration of replication we are hitting following error message in logs with an NPE:

category=CORE severity=ERROR msgID=140 msg=An uncaught exception during processing for thread Replication server RS(17407) connector thread has caused it to terminate abnormally. The stack trace for that exception is: NullPointerException: formatString was null (LocalizableMessage.java:103 ReplicationServerHandler.java:235 ReplicationServer.java:393 ReplicationServer.java:332 ReplicationServerConnectThread.java:42)
category=SYNC severity=ERROR msgID=86 msg=Replication server caught exception while listening for client connections Read timed out
