The OpenDJ copyright Maven plugin, at least as used within the context of the doc build plugin, always diffs against master, regardless of the current branch. Here's an example of the git diff command shown in output:

/bin/sh -c cd /home/mark/Documents/openig-docs && git diff --no-color --no-ext-diff --relative origin/master...HEAD .

The  --relative origin/master...HEAD . causes the copyright plugin to consider many files that have not changed in the current branch, but that are different between the current branch and master.

This renders the plugin mostly unusable unless one is working on the master branch.
