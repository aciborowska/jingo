The Javadoc says, "Returns the search scope having the specified name as defined in RFC 4511 section 4.5.1.2."

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511#section-4.5.1.2 says:
Specifies the scope of the Search to be performed. The semantics (as
 described in [X.511]) of the defined values of this field are:

baseObject: The scope is constrained to the entry named by
 baseObject.

singleLevel: The scope is constrained to the immediate
 subordinates of the entry named by baseObject.

wholeSubtree: The scope is constrained to the entry named by
 baseObject and to all its subordinates.
So you might think you can use the string values shown in the list. But why you try, it doesn't work:


Unknown scope: wholeSubtree


Instead you need to use sub, for example.
