Found using OpenDJ 6.0.0 M120.4

Scenario
1. install a 4.0.0 server for instance with a je backend
2. upgrade it to 6.0.0
3. check that 'opendj/lib/forgerock-persistit-core.jar' has been removed (as part of upgrade task for OPENDJ-4359)
=> ERROR: the file is still present after the upgrade and we have no message in the upgrade log

NOTE: 
If we execute the same scenario but installing 4.0.0 server with pdb backend, the 'opendj/lib/forgerock-persistit-core.jar' is correctly removed and we have the following message in the upgrade.log:

[02/04/2018:13:50:47 +0200] category=org.opends.server.tools.upgrade.FileManager seq=68 severity=FINE msg=deleting  file /tmp/opendj/lib/forgerock-persistit-core.jar



To reproduce the issue:

$ export OPENDJ_PREVIOUS_VERSION=4.0.0
$ export OPENDJ_PREVIOUS_BACKEND_TYPE=je
$ ./configure.py
$ ./run-pybot.py -s upgrade_group.upgrade_tasks DJ
