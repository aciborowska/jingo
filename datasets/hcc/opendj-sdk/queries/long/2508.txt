Found using OpenDJ 3.0.0 rev 427fa0913cb9a738f055904f6df776df7ff805b5
(with CAUD 3.0.0)

We found the problem during functional tests in which we change multiple times the configuration of the CA logger (add/delete policy, conf parameters,...) and to apply these changes we disable/enable the CA logger.
And the enable of the CA logger takes more and more time.

NOTE: this problem appears only on Linux

Doing in loop disalbe/enable of the CA logger we can noticed that the start time takes +10s each time
