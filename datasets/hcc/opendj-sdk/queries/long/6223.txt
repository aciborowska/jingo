Searching telephoneNumber field with a non-numeric value returns all the records.

Â 

Install DS with sample data with 50 records.

Run the ldapsearch with telephoneNumber=*demo*

Expected result: Nothing or invalid query

Actual result: Returns all the records.

Search works fine when there is a matching number or a non-matching number. Expecting to get empty or an invalid query when the value is not numeric. 
 Appears the telephoneNumber matching ignores non-numeric values and end up as * and returning all the records.
