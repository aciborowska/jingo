The problem is when we install or re-install the plugins on an upgraded DJ instance.

The plugin structure contains some schema files under `db/schema` folder  but when we upgrade a DJ instance we don't move the `config/schema` folder to `db/schema`.
And the server can't manage both location and expects all the schema files under `db/schema` and so we get an error when we start the instance because so schema files are missing under `db/schema` folder.

We should add a note in the RN to mention in such a case to move the content of `db/schema` to `config/schema` after the plugin installation.
