When used in non interactive mode, dsconfig duplicates some error message on stderr:


$ bin/dsconfig set-connection-handler-prop --handler-name HTTP           --set use-ssl:true           --hostname localhost           --port 4444           --bindDn cn=Directory\ Manager           --trustAll           --bindPassword password      --no-prompt 

The HTTP Connection Handler could not be modified because of the following
reason:

    *  A Key Manager Provider must be specified when this HTTP Connection
       Handler is enabled and it is configured to use SSL.

The operation was rejected for the following reason: A Key Manager Provider
must be specified when this HTTP Connection Handler is enabled and it is
configured to use SSL.



Expected behavior would be to have the error printed only a single time as in 6.0.0:


$  bin/dsconfig set-connection-handler-prop --handler-name HTTP           --set use-ssl:true           --hostname localhost           --port 4444           --bindDn cn=Directory\ Manager           --trustAll           --bindPassword password      --no-prompt 

The HTTP Connection Handler could not be modified because of the following
reason:

    *  A Key Manager Provider must be specified when this HTTP Connection
       Handler is enabled and it is configured to use SSL.
