When trying to run setup, if you have a config directory with some contents DS will error with the message -

There is already a server instance configured in the directory


However, if you have an empty config directory pre created you get a more misleading error - 
 

Unable to parse the version in config.version to initialize the content of the data.version file


The empty directory is removed when the setup fails so running setup a second time works.
