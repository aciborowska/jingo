	Using Control-Panel to add a custom attribute as optional to a custom objectClass.
	The appropriate schema files are being updated as expected.
	However, when trying to set the new attribute for an entry with the required objectClass leads to the following error message
    Result Code:  65 (Object Class Violation)
    Additional Information:  Entry xxx cannot not be modified because the resulting entry would have
    violated the server schema:  Entry xxx violates the Directory Server schema configuration because
    it includes attribute testattr which is not allowed by any of the objectclasses defined in that
    entry
	The same error message is generated regardless if the entry is being updated from Control-Panel or with ldapmodify.
	Restarting the LDAP server solves the problem.
	In an environment with several "multi-masters", all masters needs to be restarted.
