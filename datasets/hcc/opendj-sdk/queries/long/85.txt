authrate --help, from the 3.0-SNAPSHOT, svn revision 6768, indicates:

This utility can be used to measure bind throughput and response time of a
directory service using user-defined bind or search-then-bind operations.
Format strings may be used in the bind DN option as well as the authid and
authzid SASL bind options. A search operation may be used to retrieve the bind
DN by specifying the base DN and a filter. The retrieved entry DN will be
appended as the last argument in the argument list when evaluating format
strings. For example, to measure simple bind performance using the retrieved
user DN as the bind DN: authrate -D '%2$s' -p password -b "dc=example,dc=com"
-g 'rand(0,10000)' '(user=user.%1$d)'

In the example at the end of this paragraph, the -p  option should take an argument such as 1389 (or 389), and password should be the argument to a -w option.
Furthermore, the example filter should be, for example, '(uid=user.%1$d)'. Default generated data contains no user attribute type.
Finally, the -g option ought to take a 'rand(0,2000)' argument, as the default number of generated users through the control-panel is 2000, not 10000.
