Found with OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev (6e562514f52)

We setup a server, import some data.
We add a new base dn to the root backend, and import some data in it.
Then we set up the following property:


${INSTANCE1}/opendj/bin/dsconfig -h localhost -p ${INSTANCE1_ADMIN_PORT} -D ${INSTANCE1_ROOT_DN} -w ${INSTANCE1_ROOT_PWD} -X set-root-dse-backend-prop --set "subordinate-base-dn:dc=com" -n



and we perform an ldapsearch on the root dse backend:

${INSTANCE1}/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p ${INSTANCE1_LDAP_PORT} -D ${INSTANCE1_ROOT_DN} -w ${INSTANCE1_ROOT_PWD}  -b "" --countEntries "(objectclass=*)" dn



we were expecting to see the 1048 entries of dc=com but we see all the entries in the backend, as if the setting was not applied.
