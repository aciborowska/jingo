The upgrade from 2.4.6 to 2.5.0-Xpress1 has been observed (not in all cases) to alter the <ds-cfg-backend-id=userRoot,cn=Backends,cn=config> entry so that when the server is restarted it reports 0 entries.

The customer's config.ldif file post-upgrade contained ds-cfg-base-dn: dc=example,dc=com instead of the expected dc=customer,dc=com.

Editing in the correct DNs causes the server to see all the database entries again, so the workaround is simple.
