When running addrate in fifo mode with a 10s delete delay I notice that it only does 100% adds or 100% deletes. In other words it is either in a mode where it is adding entries, or it is in a mode where it is deleting. It's easy to observe by monitoring the access logs. It would be nice if the tool did a more balanced mix of requests.
