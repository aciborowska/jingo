https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/am/install-guide/prepare-identity-repository.html#prepare-idrepo looks like most of steps 3. & 4. are wrong, but there's one set of schema definitions that are not in the am-identity-store profile.

It looks like the profile missed a 2018 change to https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/OPENAM/repos/openam/browse/openam-server-only/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/template/ldif/opendj/push_2fa.ldif, since we still have the oath2faEnabled attribute instead of push2faEnabled.
