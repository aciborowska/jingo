ldapsearches with a search filter that has “_” (underscore) are working in previous versions of DS (3.x), but failing in 6.5.x with the following message:

The attribute description “mobile_login” could not be parsed because it contains an invalid character “” at position 6_ 

If the ldapsearches are performed from AM => DS, the following is observed:   

	AM 13.5.1 to DS 3.0 works (when used attribute “mobile_login” as search filter)
	AM 13.5.1 to DS 6.5.x fails (when used attribute “mobile_login” as search filter)
	AM 6.5.x to DS 6.5.x fails (when used attribute “mobile_login” as search filter)
	AM 6.5.x to DS 3.0 fails (when used the attribute “mobile_login” as search filter)



 
 A possible solution as per Chris Ridd's notes:
 The 6.5 server code only allows well-formed attribute descriptions when parsing a filter. I think we could safely allow malformed attribute descriptions here.

From opendj-core/.../AttributeDescription.java:


static String validateAttributeDescription(final String attributeDescription) {
 if (attributeDescription == null) {
 // Some Filter allows null attribute description and these must perform the null check them-self.
 return null;
 }
 valueOf0(null, attributeDescription, false, NoOpFactory.INSTANCE);
 return attributeDescription;
}

Change the 'false' to a 'true'.

N.B! This has not been tested and setting the flag from false to true will also change the behavior of the server, which may have a detrimental effect. 
  
 This affects the client SDK as well, so ldapsearch (and AM) will not even send such a search filter to the server.
