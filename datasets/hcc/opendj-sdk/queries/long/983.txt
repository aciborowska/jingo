Since revision 8978, the "<instance-dir>/logs" folder does not exit anymore when the instance is not configured.

On Windows we get the following error messages when running the "start-ds -V" command (same with -F/-s):

C:\opendj>.\bat\start-ds.bat -V
The system cannot find the path specified.
The system cannot find the path specified.

=> in fact the command tries to redirect the output to the file "<instance-dir>/logs/native-windows.out" and the redirection fails as the logs folder does not exist

The problem occurs with all the tools which use winlauncher.exe:

	start-ds
	stop-ds
	control-panel
	setup
	uninstall
