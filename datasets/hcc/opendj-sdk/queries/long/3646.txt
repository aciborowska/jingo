The new back-pressure mechanism in the Grizzly Listener limits the maximum number of active requests a connection can have: 64 slot by default, allowing the processing of 64 concurrent request per connection.

Once a request has been fully processed and the final response sent, the slot occupied by this request becomes free again and another request can take its place in order to be processed and so on...

The problem is that AbandonRequest doesn't send response at all. So the slot never becomes free and other requests cannot be processed. If all of the 64 slots have been filled with AbandonRequest s, the connection will be suspended: no other requests will be read from that connection.

This bug might be the source of the problem described in OPENIDM-7150.
