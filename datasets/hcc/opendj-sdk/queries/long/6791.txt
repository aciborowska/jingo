The retry mechanism used when a RS cannot connect to another RS is a bit aggressive as it triggers multiple connections per second:

Acceptance criteria:

	The re-connection attempt is made less aggressively. Ideally using an exponential backoff algorithm which gradually increases the delay between two re-connection attempts when multiple sequential failures occurred.
