Unit tests and functional tests saw occurrences of the following error message: 

An unexpected error was encountered while processing a search in one of the Directory Server backends: ConcurrentModificationException(LinkedHashMap.java:719).

This started happening while we were working hard on monitoring.

 

Looking through where we build a LinkedHashMap, I noticed that DiskSpaceMonitor had a few unprotected accesses to {{LinkedHashMap}}s.
