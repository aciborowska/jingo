Using AM12.0.2 and DJ2.6.3 or 3.0.0 with je as a CTS, we generate some oauth2 load, which causes some add/del load against the CTS:

	1.5k adds/sec
	1.2k dels/sec



With both version of DJ, delete etime is about 5 times bigger than add etime, which seems unexpected:

	DJ2.6 add avg etime: 0.360ms / del avg etime: 2.070ms
	DJ 3.0: add avg etime: 0.300ms / del avg etime: 1.600ms
