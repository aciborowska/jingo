Found using OpenDJ-4.0.0 rev (0b7da454b79).

Steps to reproduce:
1. unzip archive with OpenDJ
2. create a file /path/to/opendj/instance.loc with instance path
3. run a setup

./setup directory-server -h opendj.example.com -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w password --adminConnectorPort 4444 -Z 1636 -t je -b dc=com  -O --acceptLicense	



at this point, I hit an issue :


The first line of the instance.loc file
(/path/to/instance)
does not point to an existing directory


Which is not expected behavior in comparison to Windows, where the /path/to/instance is created during setup.

The workaround exists. To bypass the problem I have to create the directory /path/to/instance before running the setup tool.
