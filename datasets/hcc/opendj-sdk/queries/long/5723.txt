The SDK's ConnectionPool should track the pending requests so that they can be cancelled when the virtual pooled Connection is closed.

A possible algorithm:

• Add the RequestHandle when the request is sent into a ConcurrentHashSet
• Remove the RequestHandle when the result for the request is received.
• On disconnection, invoke something like pendingRequests.forEach(RequestHandle::abandon)
