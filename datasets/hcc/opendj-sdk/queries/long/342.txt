i am trying to setup/test a particular DS structure,
as far as i know DS by default will have anonymous read/search enabled against the domain,
however with the domain i am using, it keeps on firing " 09:45:43 PM: List failed
Root error: [LDAP: error code 50 - You do not have sufficient privileges to perform an unindexed search]
". to give an idea os the structure level
dc=test
---> ou=people
this is the default testing with 2000 users created as provided via the control-panel interface, which by the way will only list the first 1000 users per the configuration in the instance - which is fine - 
now if i try to extended a number of levels below the 
dc=test
---> ou =inside1
-------> ou=inside2
----------> ou=inside3
.....etc, it would see that wont even attempt to list the first 1000 entries and would simply fire the error, as listed,, i tried to extend a specific aci for the directory and the domain using both targetscope and without it and in neither case was successful, and i am not sure if its something i am missing or a misconfiguration...

something like this:
dn: dc=test
changetype: modify
add: aci
aci: (target ="ldap:///dc=test")(targetattr ="*")(targetscope = "subtree")(version 3.0;acl "Anonymous read-search access 2"; allow (read, search, compare)(userdn = "ldap:///anyone")

any help is very much appreciated..

thanks
Ayman
