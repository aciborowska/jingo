While a "reference" resolves to a resource-type, the referenced entries can effectively be from that resource-type but also from any other sub-type or auxiliary type of that resource-type.

The problem is that when all properties are requested for a "reference"'d resource, (e.g: _fields=/manager/*) only the LDAP attributes defined in the resolved resource-type are fetched (e.g: the one defined in frapi:opendj:rest2ldap:user:1.0) while all/some entries can be of a sub-type of that resource-type (e.g: frapi:opendj:rest2ldap:posixUser:1.0).
 As a side effect, some properties can be missing or rendered with their default values.
Acceptance criteria:

	When all fields of a referenced resource are requested (e.g: _fields=/manager/*), we must fetch all the LDAP properties of the resolved resource-type and of its sub/auxiliary types.
