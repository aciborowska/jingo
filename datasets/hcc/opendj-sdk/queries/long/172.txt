When searching through the External Changelog, with either the Cookie Control or without (changes ordered by integer changeNumber), the cookie returned in each entry (via the Control response or the ChangeLogCookie operational attribute) varies depending on how the search was initiated and the content of the replication DB.

After some time, replication changes are getting purged. The cookies return are build from the initial cookie (which can be updated) with updates only with changenumbers of entries being returned. As a result, the same entry may be returned with different cookies. This is bad for consistency and reproducibility of synchronization tools.
