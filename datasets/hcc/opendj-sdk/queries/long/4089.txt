OpenDJ 3.5.1 with confidentiality enabled on DB backends.

After doing "dsreplication enable" from node1, on one backend, ldapsearch on node2 (on another unrelated and not replicated backend) fails with:

SEARCH operation failed
 Result Code:  80 (Other)
 Additional Information:  The entry database does not contain a valid record for ID 513
TEST CASE

1. Set up two DJ 3.5.1 (dj1 and dj2) with backends:

	userRoot ("dc=example,dc=com")
	amRoot ("dc=config,dc=openam").



Enable confidentiality on both backends.

2. Import sample LDIFs for the 3 base DNs into dj1 and dj2. (stop-ds, import-ldif)

3. Start-ds on dj1 and dj2.

4. On dj1, dsreplication enable for "dc=example,dc=com" only (where host1 is dj1, host2 is dj2). 
 No need to "dsreplication initialize-all" (problem is reproducible with or without initializing dj2).

Do not enable replication for the other suffix(es).

5. Searching the non-replicated backed on dj2 still works:

./ldapsearch -p 3390 -D "cn=directory manager" -w password -b "ou=services,dc=config,dc=openam" -s base "objectclass=*" ou
dn: ou=services,dc=config,dc=openam
ou: services


6. Restart dj2 (stop-ds; start-ds).

7. Searching the non-replicated backend on dj2 now fails:

./ldapsearch -p 3390 -D "cn=directory manager" -w password -b "ou=services,dc=config,dc=openam" -s base "objectclass=*" ou
SEARCH operation failed
Result Code: 80 (Other)
Additional Information: The entry database does not contain a valid record for ID 12


8. Searching the replicated backed on dj2 still works:

./ldapsearch -p 3390 -D "cn=directory manager" -w password -b "dc=example,dc=com" -s base "objectclass=*" dc
dn: dc=example,dc=com
dc: example
