Found on opendj3-server-dev branch (revision 10203).

I tried to enable the debug logger and I got the following error:

$ ./opendj/bin/dsconfig set-log-publisher-prop --publisher-name "File-Based Debug Logger" --set enabled:true --set default-debug-level:warning --set log-file:logs/mydebug -h localhost -p 1444 -D "cn=myself" -w "password" -n -X
The File Based Debug Log Publisher could not be modified due to a
communications problem: A communication problem occurred while contacting the server: [LDAP: error code 80 - The attempt to apply the configuration
modification failed. The preliminary checks were all successful and the
modified entry was written to the server configuration, but at least one of
the configuration change listeners reported an error when attempting to apply
the change: Class org.opends.server.loggers.debug.TextDebugLogPublisher
