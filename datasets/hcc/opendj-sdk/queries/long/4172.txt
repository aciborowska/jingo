The backup tool (and docs) mention we support crontab(5) "compatible" time/data "patterns", but not which pattens or not what types are not allowed, such as EXTENSIONS.

 


--recurringTask {schedulePattern}

Indicates the task is recurring and will be scheduled according to the value argument expressed in crontab(5) compatible time/date pattern


The tool/docs need to clarify the only formats allowed are as follows.

 


       The time and date fields are:

              field          allowed values
              -----          --------------
              minute         0-59
              hour           0-23
              day of month   1-31
              month          1-12 (or names, see below)
              day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sunday, or use names)

       A field may contain an asterisk (*), which always stands for
       "first-last".

       Ranges of numbers are allowed.  Ranges are two numbers separated with
       a hyphen.  The specified range is inclusive.  For example, 8-11 for
       an 'hours' entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10, and 11.

       Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated
       by commas.  Examples: "1,2,5,9", "0-4,8-12".
