After building and installing DJ with CAUD support, I don't see the .jar files for forgerock-audit-handler-jdbc or forgerock-audit-handler-syslog.

On the one hand, it's true that the "external" configuration for these makes them harder to use. It's not clear that they will be used, especially not the Syslog handler, since OpenDJ currently supports only access events.

On the other hand, it will be quite painful for any directory admins who need to use them if we don't ship them, and they have both to wrestle with the external configuration and also to figure out the framework versions to get the right .jar files from Maven after the fact. Plus, the JDBC handler .jar is currently about 50KB and the Syslog handler .jar is currently about 30KB, so they are not going to weigh down the download.
