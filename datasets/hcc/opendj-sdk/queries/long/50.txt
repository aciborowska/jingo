Currently the search operation processing does not detect that the search is requesting only the base object. So it iterates through each and every change log record entry needlessly.

In addition, we should add support for numSubordinates if possible. Presumably, this can be calculated using:

    lastChangeNumber - firstChangeNumber + 1
