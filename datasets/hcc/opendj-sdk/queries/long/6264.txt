This seem to be random DJ bug - I was not able to reproduce it on my pc.Â  It occurred in proxy.BasicSSL.Modrate_Substring_SSL test after running:


modrate -h comte.internal.forgerock.com -p 1638 -D "cn=proxy_user,o=example" -w password -d 1800 -b uid=user.\{1},ou=People,o=example -S -g "rand(0,99999)" -c 40 -t 3 -i 18 -X -Z -F -g "randstr(200)" "description:\{2}"


Then this error occurred:


 ERROR:
-- rc --

-- stdout --

-- stderr --
The LDAP bind request failed: 49 (Invalid Credentials)


As I mentioned I was not able to reproduce it on my pc, but maybe you will. To reproduce you can try to run:


./run-pybot.py - c stress -s proxy.BasicSSL - t Modrate_Substring_SSL opendj
