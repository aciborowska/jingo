There's a bug in the doc test routine that validates JSON resources.

For example, an expected result includes something like:

  "manager" : {
    "_id" : "kvaughan",
    "displayName" : "Kirsten Vaughan"
  }


But the actual is now omething like:

  "manager" : {
    "_id" : "kvaughan"
  } 

The tests that should be failing are passing:


$ mvn clean -P test verify -Dexec.args="install.bats dev-guide/rest_operations.bats"
