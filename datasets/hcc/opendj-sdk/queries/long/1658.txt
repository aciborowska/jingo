Although the administrator must restart OpenDJ after changing the content of the HTTP connection handler config file for the changes to take effect, the reference documentation does not mention the need to restart.

See http://docs.forgerock.org/en/opendj/2.6.0/configref/http-connection-handler.html#config-file.

The restart is shown in the Admin Guide at http://docs.forgerock.org/en/opendj/2.6.0/admin-guide/index.html#setup-rest2ldap-connection-handler, but it would be good to have it show up in the reference as well.
