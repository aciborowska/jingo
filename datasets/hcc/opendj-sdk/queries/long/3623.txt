Hi,

I have created a certificate for SSL and performed SSL assignment as well. Once this is done, I am configuring the connection handlers to use this created certificate from keystore/truststore. And enabling use-ssl attribute to be true for LDAPS connection handler.

Once this is done, sometimes, I could see that while disabling and enabling the connection handlers for the applied changes to be reflected, disabling is proper, but while enabling, it is not getting enabled and seems to be completely hanged.

However, this is an intermittent behavior but still needs a rootcause since it is frequently occuring.
But opendj service is still online, only the connection handlers being in disabled state.

Thanks and Regards,
Anusha
