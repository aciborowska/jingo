Given: an endpoint exposing "users" and a sub-type "posixUsers"
When: a query is performed which selects all users having "gid" of X (gid is a posixUser field)
Then: the query results should only include posixUsers having X as their gid.

Unfortunately, the query filter is converted directly to an LDAP search filter  using the "user" resource definition, so the "gid" assertion is translated into an "always false" LDAP filter.
