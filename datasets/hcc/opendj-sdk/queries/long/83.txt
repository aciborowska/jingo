It looks like changeInititatorsName and maybe changeTime are calculated from the modifiersName and modifyTimestamp. Since these attributes are not updated for delete operations, the changeInitiatorsName is wrong. We should either:


	ensure that modifiersName and modifyTimestamp are updated for delete operations
	populate the changeInitiatorsName using a different source: e.g. the authorization DN.



Now I think of it, I think the 1st option is the best since the fix will inherited by other functionality which depends on the modifyTimestamp/modifiersName. For example, someone may implement a post-op plugin which "archives" deleted entries: these archived entries should have the correct operational attributes.
