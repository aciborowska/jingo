During startup, DJ fetch the biggest allocated ID by cursoring into id2entry. To do that, since id are monotone gorwing sequence, it position the cursor at the end of id2entry and get the associated ID.

Problem is, due to the page allocation/deallocation algorithm of PDB, id2entry is still referencing those empty leaf pages produced by all the delete operation since the database creation. Those "zombie" pages (containing deleted values but still referenced in the b-tree) are wasting storage space and CPU because they have to be traversed during cursoring.
