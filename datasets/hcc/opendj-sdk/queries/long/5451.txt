Reading the Release Notes on https://qa-backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/5.5/release-notes/, I noticed that there are a number of issues in the Known Issues list that have been fixed by this release but not removed from the list.

OPENDJ-4947
OPENDJ-5127
OPENDJ-5210

I think it would be better if the list of Key Fixes in Directory Services 5.5.2, contains the initial JIRA number rather than the one of the backports. It will help with making sure the issues are not listed in multiple lists (fixed and known).
