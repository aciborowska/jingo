You can construct Modify Requests by specifying individual changes, by diffing entries or by using LDIFs.

The manual has an example of the diffing technique, and the example code uses the LDIF technique. But specifying individual changes isn't mentioned here, and as it can obviously be more efficient it really should get a mention.

There's an example of doing this in example 8.2 (updating static groups) so maybe a cross ref to that section would help.
