This issue follows up the issue #OPENDJ-5275: the migration from java.io to java.nio has some side effect in the exceptions thrown and how they are reported to the user.

	with the java.io API, a java.io.FileNotFoundException is thrown with a detailMessage set to the filename + "(No such file or directory)" (for Linux) or "The system cannot find the file specified)" (for Windows)
	with the java.nio API, a java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException is thrown with a detailMessage set to null



To reproduce there is a PyForge test (currently in my branch):


./run-pybot.py -s clu_group.ldifsearch_dj -t Simple_Search_On_Non_Existing_File -v opendj



Steps:

	Setup a 6.0.0 or 6.5.0
	Run the following command (where foo.ldif is a file that doesn't exist):


./ldifsearch -b dc=example,dc=com foo.ldif uid=bjensen






	We may expect to have a specific output like that:


An error occurred while attempting to open the LDIF file foo.ldif for reading: foo.ldif (No such file or directory)


but instead of ^^ we have:


An error occurred while attempting to open the LDIF file foo.ldif for reading: foo.ldif


The end of the message is missing.



NOTE: depending on the version of DJ, the message changed:

	2.6 -> 5.0:


An error occurred while attempting to create the LDIF reader:
"java.io.FileNotFoundException: foo.ldif (No such file or directory)






	5.5.0:


An error occurred while attempting to open the LDIF file foo.ldif for reading: foo.ldif (No such file or directory)






	6.0 or current 6.5:


An error occurred while attempting to create the LDIF for
"reading: foo.ldif





If we wish to be consistent, the message should be almost the same as #OPENDJ-5275 (i.e. as in 5.5.0).
