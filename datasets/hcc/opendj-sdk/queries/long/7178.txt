This is regression caused by commit 5ff8863abce. There is removal of toLowerCase() in ObjectPropertyMapper.java) and this makes requests like

http://test.example.com:8080 "GET /api/query/users?_prettyPrint=true&_queryFilter=employeenumber+lt+%2210%22

to behave differently than requests like:

http://test.example.com:8080 "GET /api/query/users?_prettyPrint=true&_queryFilter=employeeNumber+lt+%2210%22

The first one returns 0 entries and the second returns few entries.

Tests to reproduce this:

run-pybot.py -v -s "rest2ldap_group.query*" dj
