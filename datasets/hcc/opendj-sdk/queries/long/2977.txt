The tuning section of the manual talks a little bit about tuning JE, but does not mention PDB at all.

The main unresolved question is "how much cache does the backend need", which might be simply as much space (+growth room) as the backend files are using on disk.

It would be nice if we could document cache stats such as % used and cache hits/misses, for JE as well as PDB.
