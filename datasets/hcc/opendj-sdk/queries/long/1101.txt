Given


	start with a fresh install with automatically generated data
	add the following ACI to restrict anonymous user's access to "dc=example,dc=com":

dn: dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
add: aci
aci: (target ="ldap:///dc=example,dc=com")(version 3.0;acl "Deny anonymous access";
 deny (all)(userdn = "ldap:///anyone");)




When

Doing anonymous compare:


ldapcompare -p 1389 "uid:user.9" "uid=user.8,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"


Then

Actual


ldapcompare -p 1389 uid:user.9 uid=user.8,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
Comparing type uid with value user.9 in entry uid=user.8,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
Compare operation returned false for entry uid=user.8,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com


Expected?? (I am not sure about it)

Here is what I would expect as a user, but I am wondering if the DSEE ACI model agree or disagres with this view?


Comparing type uid with value user.9 in entry uid=user.8,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
COMPARE operation failed
Result Code:  32 (No Such Entry)
Additional Information:  COMPARE operation failed
