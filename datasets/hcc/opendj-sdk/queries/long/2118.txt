Since changelog indexer seems to be a bottleneck for changelog purge, we disable the indexer with the following command:


dsconfig -h bigmac.internal.forgerock.com -p 4444 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -X set-replication-server-prop --provider-name "Multimaster Synchronization" --set compute-change-number:false -n



but then the changelog purge does not seem to work properly any more (changelogDb size not decreasing after stopping to load the server with modrate)
