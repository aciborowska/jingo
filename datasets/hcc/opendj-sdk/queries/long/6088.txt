Found with rev (c241ee33407)

In our replication tests:


	We set up a 4 servers topology with data, with 2 DSs and 2 RSs.
	We set up 2 groups, first group containing DJ1/RS1, second group containing DJ2/RS2
	We perform some operations
	We stop RS2 and RS1
At that point, there sometimes is an error message in DJ2 logs:

./DJ2/opendj/logs/errors file --- 	
12:16:53.120 	WARN 	(ERROR) [08/Mar/2019:11:16:49 +0000] category=SYNC severity=ERROR msgID=119 msg=Directory server DS(dj2) encountered an unexpected error while connecting to replication server localhost:8991 for domain "cn=schema": IllegalArgumentException: Unexpected PDU type: org.opends.server.replication.protocol.StopMsg: 	


Check for error patterns in ./DJ2/opendj/logs/replication file --- 	
12:16:53.123 	WARN 	(ERROR) [08/Mar/2019:11:16:49 +0000] category=SYNC severity=ERROR msgID=119 msg=Directory server DS(dj2) encountered an unexpected error while connecting to replication server localhost:8991 for domain "cn=schema": IllegalArgumentException: Unexpected PDU type: org.opends.server.replication.protocol.StopMsg:





Shouldn't this error be caught smoothly given that the RS is indeed stopped?

To reproduce:

./run-pybot.py -s replication_group1.GroupIdAsString opendj
