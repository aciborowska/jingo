Found using OpenDJ-2.8.0 (revision 12543).

Scenario:
------------
1. setup instance with some automatically-generated data
2. create a new index on attribute description (don't rebuild it)
3. run verify-index tool
=> we have the message to indicate that the index dc=com_description is working in degraded state
4. import some data in append mode
=> at the beginning of the import have the message to indicate that the index dc=com_description is working in degraded state
5. run verify-index tool
=> at this point the verify-index tool reports some errors (as expected) but the message (to indicate that the index dc=com_description is working in degraded state) has disappeared

In attachement script + ldif to reproduce the problem.
