If the key manager contains multiple certificates, it is not ensured that the correct certificate is selected for HTTPS.
This was managed in the original code of the plugin, but was accidentally dropped when migrating the HTTP framework from restlet to chf apache client.
The solution is to add a AliasKeyManager inner class to the idm plugin to ensure the correct certificate is always selected.
