With 7.0.0-SNAPSHOT rev. 3304cd99e26 we have following message in logs:

[23/Jun/2020:23:43:18 +0000] category=SYNC severity=WARNING msgID=179 msg=A transient problem occurred while Replication Server my1stServerId was connecting to this Replication Server localhost/127.0.0.1:9134. The Replication Server should try to reconnect later. The problem was: SocketException(no more data)

[23/Jun/2020:23:43:48 +0000] category=SYNC severity=ERROR msgID=86 msg=Replication server caught exception while listening for client connections: SocketTimeoutException(Read timed out)


 Looks like we have this error when we setup server with replication port. After we start it and configure something on server.

In last failed test the first message above was printed when running following command after start:

/opendj/bin/dsconfig -h localhost -p 4548 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X set-access-control-handler-prop --reset global-aci -n


We hit this for instance with test:


python3 run-pybot.py -v -s setup_group.serverId DJ
