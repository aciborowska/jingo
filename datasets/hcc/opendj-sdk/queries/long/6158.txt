    OPENDJ-6048 Keep and use an in-memory model of the discovery information
    
    - add new Topology class to maintain information on servers of the topology
    - add access to the topology from the ServerContext
    - update the topology based on local server information and TopologyMsg received from
      the remote RSs of the topology
    - TopologyMsg includes all RSs of the topology when sent to a remote RS


I see the following failures in opendj-docs non-regression tests for examples in the replication chapter:

not ok 12 configure and initialize replication with standalone RS
not ok 15 configure and initialize replication with standalone DS
not ok 16 demonstrate setting group IDs
not ok 23 enable changelog to include unchanged attributes


These tests pass with opendj built from the previous commit:

    OPENDJ-6125: Include the rootUser and monitorUser ldif files
    
            This covers the case where an upgraded DS instance contains one of the following
                    * rootUser0.ldif
                    * monitorUser0.ldif


To reproduce the failures:

git clone ssh://git@stash.forgerock.org:7999/opendj/opendj-docs.git && cd opendj-docs
mvn clean verify -P test -Dexec.args="install.bats install_replica.bats admin-guide/replication.bats"
