DitCacheMap maintains a size on added/removed DNs. In case a DN already exists as intermediate value, (as ancestor of a previuosly added DN) adding is not taken into account in the size.
So, adding cn=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com and later ou=people,dc=example,dc=com makes size() return 1 instead of 2.
