Running setup of DJ3, trying to enable replication with an existing DJ2.6 replica, we get:
Data Replication
Choose the base DNs that you want to create and whose contents will be replicated with the remote servers.

	dc=openam,dc=forgerock,dc=com => the user data suffix
	dc=replicationChanges => which is unexpected.



dc=replicationChanges appears to be a legacy interface from DJ2.6 and should just be ignored by the setup (i.e. as "cn=admin data", "cn=config"...)
