Step to reproduce:
Run ldapdelete against a valid server
Then you have to type specified one or multiple DN in the console.
To let the server starts processing delete request(s), you have to leave a blank line.

Issue is that leaving one (or multiple) blank lines does nothing, the only way to close the tool is to make an error while writing a DN.
previous entered valid DN will be ignored.


$ bin/ldapdelete -h localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w password
uid=user.1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com





invalid
The provided value "invalid" could not be parsed as a valid distinguished name
because the last non-space character was part of the attribute name 'invalid'
