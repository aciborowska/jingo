Found using OpenDJ 6.0.0 M120.7

We found this issue running long stress tests (for 1.5 days) doing:

	modify operations on split DS/RS topology
	add/del operations on standard topology (combined DS/RS)



For instance on the modify test on split DS/RS topology, we noticed that the two DS are blocked and are not accepting new operations => the modrate tool output shows a recent throughput of 0 and 0 errors.
We have not errors in the DS and RS logs.
