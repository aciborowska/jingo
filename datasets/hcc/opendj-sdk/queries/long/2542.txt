When I enable the common audit log publisher with criteria (record-type: CONNECT) and filtering-policy:inclusive. I was able to see weird sequence of '\x000' in the log file once I have run ldapsearch. This sequence looks like blank line if you open the log with text editor. To see the sequence you need to read the file with python and print it's content.
Script attached to reproduce the bug.
