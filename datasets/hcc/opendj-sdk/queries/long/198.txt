Reading "cn=monitor" branch of Sun Directory Server 7.0 with ldapsearch from ldap-toolkit (3.0-SNAPSHOT) fails with the following error message:

Result Code:  84 (Decoding Error)
Additional Information:  The attribute description
"plugin-list-validate_account" could not be parsed because it contains an
invalid character "_" at position 20

Although the behaviour is according to the RFC 4512, some directories might not enforce it which might prevent a user from reading it's contents. It would be good if the support for this standard could be optional so it does not impair it's usability with directory implementations other then OpenDJ.
