The data stored in the ADS backend (cn=Admin Data) is not using proper schema.
If a user has defined custom schema that matches one of the attributes used by the ADS, the service may no longer work properly.
This has been discovered by a user who had a customer schema defining "Id" as an Integer.
ADS should define its own schema with its own namespace to avoid messing with user's schema.
