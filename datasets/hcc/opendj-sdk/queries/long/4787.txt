If we setup a proxy connected to a directory server over SSL, on connection handlers using certificates that are invalid, but signed by a CA in our truststore, we don't get any error, except if the certificate is expired.

Steps to reproduce:

	We create a DS instance, with connection handlers using different invalid certificates, signed by a common CA (expired, wrong host, signed by untrusted CA, revoked)
	We setup a proxy, with a static discovery mechanism, using SSL, truststore with the common CA, and pointing to the DS instance's invalid cert ports.
	We check the logs of the proxy instance:



For expired certificate, we have:


[13/Feb/2018:16:06:36 +0100] category=UTIL severity=ERROR msgID=161 msg=Refusing to trust server or issuer certificate 'CN=viktor.internal.forgerock.com, O=Forgerock, C=FR' because it expired on Thu Jan 18 11:20:30 CET 2018


in the errors log, and nothing in the json access log (we get some "No such entry" failed internal searches, if we enable file based logger with internal operations)

For other certificates, we get no error in the logs.
