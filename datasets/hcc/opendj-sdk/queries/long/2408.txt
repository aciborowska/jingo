Step to reproduce:

	Unzip an opendj instance or install the msi package in a path which contains spaces (e.g C:\Program Files (x86)\opendj)
	Try to setup a local server (both command line and GUI installers are impacted)
As soon as the install process starts it fails during the configure step.
Here is the exception printed in the temporary setup log file:

[04/11/2015:11:03:14 +0000] category=QUICKSETUP seq=3 severity=SEVERE msg=Caught exception: Error copying file C:\Program Files (x86)\opendj\template\config\admin-backend.ldif to C:\Program Files (x86)\opendj\config\admin-backend.ldif.


Same procedure has been tested with an instance which does not contains any spaces in it path (e.g C:\opendj and it worked fine.
