	This affects following tools: authrate, backup, restore, export-ldif, import-ldif, manage-tasks, rebuild-index, dsconfig.



Steps to reproduce:

1.Try to run one of the mentioned tools against a connection handler with an invalid certificate


./bin/backup -p 443 -h expired.badssl.com -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -n userRoot -d /home/viktor/repos/pyforge/results/20180220-160454/badssl_group/tmp

2. Check the return code


echo $?
1

For other ldaptools, the return code is 91 (Connect Error), so for consistency, it should be the same here.
