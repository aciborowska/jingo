Checking Monitoring with JMX section, https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/ds/admin-guide/index.html#jmx-monitoring
I noticed this reference to the Java 1.5 JMX documentation.


Also configure security to login remotely. See the section on Using SSL in Monitoring and Management Using JMX for hints.




It would be nice to update the link to point to Java 8 documentation:
