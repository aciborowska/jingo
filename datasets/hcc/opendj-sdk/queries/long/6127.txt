When attempting to generate the schema reference documentation on Windows, the build fails with an error:

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.forgerock.opendj:opendj-doc-maven-plugin:7.0.0-SNAPSHOT:generate-docbook-schema-reference (generate-docbook-schema-reference) on project schema-reference: Invalid byte 1 of 1-byte UTF-8 sequence. -> [Help 1] 

Workaround: before building opendj-docs on Windows, change to the doc-builds directory.
