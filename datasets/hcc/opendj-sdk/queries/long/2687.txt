Found with OpenDJ 4.0.0 rev 3610cc2b7bc4fa3228f18e361823035064d5aa0b

We have found some issues with the schema test suite in our non-regression set of tests.

The test suite that is failing is setting up a server with some entries.
It then tries to add a new attribute type but we encounter the following error:


ADD operation failed
Result Code:  80 (Other)
Additional Information:  An error occurred while attempting to load the contents of schema file 05-DynamicSchemaAdd.ldif into the server schema: Unable to parse an attribute type definition from schema configuration file 05-DynamicSchemaAdd.ldif: The provided value "( addschema1at-oid NAME 'addschema1AT' X-SCHEMA-FILE '05-DynamicSchemaAdd.ldif' )" could not be parsed as a valid attribute type description because it does not declare a syntax nor a superior type. Attribute type descriptions must declare a superior type or a syntax



see attached script to reproduce the issue.
