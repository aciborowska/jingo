To reproduce this issue, set up a two node replication.

On node 1:

	Drop free disk space to below disk-low-threshold but above disk-full-threshold
	Increase free disk space to above disk-low-threshold. Node 1 reports error "Could not restart the Replication Server, bind to listen port".
	Drop free disk space to below disk-low-threshold but above disk-full-threshold
	Drop free disk space to below disk-full-threshold. Node 1 DS would connect to node 2 RS.
 Node 1 reports:

[07/Jul/2020:15:39:42 +0800] category=SYNC severity=ERROR msgID=73 msg=An unexpected error occurred when searching for generation id for domain "dc=example,dc=com": Unwilling to Perform There are insufficient resources to perform the operation

Node 2 reports:

	Increase free disk space to below disk-low-threshold but above disk-full-threshold.
	Increase free disk space to above disk-low-threshold. Node 1 RS would report error "Could not restart the Replication Server, bind to listen port". Node 1 DS is still connected to Node 2 RS.
	Create a new entry or delete an entry on node 1. The operational is successful. However, node 2 RS reports error

[07/Jul/2020:15:42:35 +0800] category=SYNC severity=WARNING msgID=135 msg=Replication server RS(18124) ignoring update 000001732839fa0d2edd00000011 for domain "dc=example,dc=com" from directory server DS(11997) at opendj.example.com/192.168.56.2:35432 because its generation ID 8970 is different to the local generation ID 8970





The change is not sync'd to node 2 DS.
