We have a test that checks the error message when we use status tool with version 6.5 and over against a 5.5 server.
The expected behavior is that it returns 1 and prints out on stderr:


$ /path/to/opendj/bin/status -p 35044 -D cn=directory\ manager -w password --trustAll
Unable to determine remote server version, status tool is compatible with
server versions greater than or equal to 6.0.0



But since the push on server id that becomes mandatory, we have a return code of 80 and the following message:


Other: The Global Configuration could not be decoded due to the following reason: The "server-id" property must be specified as it is mandatory



Should we keep the old behavior?
