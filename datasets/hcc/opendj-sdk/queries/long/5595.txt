Found using OpenDJ 6.5.0-SNAPSHOT (rev ae2bb50644fdf728c052a44a5e01ccb6e2ce9b1d).

Scenario
1. install a directory server under `/tmp/DJ1` folder for instance
2. change current directory to `/tmp` and run the `supportextract` tool

$ cd /tmp
$ ./DJ1/opendj/bin/supportextract -D cn=myself -w password -d /tmp/support
2018-10-19 01:03:19 INFO   The instance is running
2018-10-19 01:03:19 INFO   No value was provided for --jdkToolsDirectory, JDK tool directory is set to /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_171.jdk/Contents/Home/bin
2018-10-19 01:03:19 INFO   VERSION: 6.5.0.ae2bb50644fdf728c052a44a5e01ccb6e2ce9b1d
2018-10-19 01:03:22 INFO   Collecting the monitoring info from cn=monitor
...
The following archive has been created :
/tmp/support/opendj-support-data-20181019-010319.zip


3. check data generated

$ ls 
DJ1   supportextract.log


4. check content of the generated archive

$ unzip -l /tmp/support/opendj-support-data-20181019-010319.zip | grep "supportextract.log"
     4513  10-19-2018 01:03   support-data/supportextract.log



So the tool print info on stdout/sdterr, the same info are stored in `supportextract.log` file in the current working directory and also store in `supportextract.log` file inside the generated archive

==> the `supportextract.log` file generated in the current working directory should be removed
