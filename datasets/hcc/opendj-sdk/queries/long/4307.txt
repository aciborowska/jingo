Problem found with OpenDJ 5.5.0 rev 9ab7ea1c210

We noticed a perf regression using the following searchrate command:

opendj-ldap-toolkit/bin/searchrate -h  localhost -p 1389 -D "cn=myself" -w password -d 1800 -b uid=user.%d,ou=People,dc=com -S -g "rand(0,99999)" -c 40 -t 1 -i 18  "objectclass=*"




	with rev 6f843d2e809 => average etime was 6ms
	with rev 9ab7ea1c210 => average etime is 35ms



NOTE: same problem with addrate and rebind
