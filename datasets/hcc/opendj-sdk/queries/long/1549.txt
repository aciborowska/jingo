It looks like there are a number of problems with the statistics functionality in the xxxrate tools:


	the 3/4/5 etimes do not account for the warm up duration. Specifically, PerformanceRunner.eTimeBuffer and related ReversibleArrays in the StatsThread should not be accessed during the warm-up period
	the synchronization in UpdateStatsResultHandler.updateStats() looks dubious: it is synchronizing on the handler, but a handler is created for each request. We'll need to be careful fixing this because adding more coarse grained locking may result in performance degradation in the tool
	the reversible arrays used for storing etimes only have a capacity of 100k etimes per interval. The default interval is 5s, which equates to 20k operations/s. We are performing 140k/s operations so the results are not going to be very accurate
	appending to the reversible array looks highly inefficient when the array is reversed. Need to evaluate if this is avoided at the moment and if improvement is required
	the etime percentile calculation code is quite hard to understand and could do with some cleanup and documentation.
