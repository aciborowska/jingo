With 7.0.0-SNAPSHOT rev. d5519aaa973 we hit an issue in upgrade job:

You have provided options for scheduling this operation as a task but options
provided for connecting to the server's tasks backend resulted in the
following error: 'Unwilling to Perform: The Directory Server is not configured
to allow task org.opends.server.tasks.BackupPurgeTask to be invoked'


This is output of a cmd:

./bin/dsbackup purge -h openam.example.com -p 4444 -D "cn=myself" -w password -X  --backupLocation "/tmp/dsbackup_300" --backupId test1_20200720151906837


Command to reproduce:
 You will need to replace config.cfg by uploaded config.cfg.

python3 run-pybot.py -v -s backends_group.dsBackupPurge -t purge_backup_id_online DJ


Steps:

	Setup DJ (4.0.0)
	Upgrade to 7.0.0
	Create 2 new backends test1 and test2
	Add data to test1 and test2
	stop server
	create offline backup of test1
	start server
	check with dsbackup list that backup exists
	run the dsbackup purge cmd above
