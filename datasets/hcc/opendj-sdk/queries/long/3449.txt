The reference part of documentation contains same paragraph many times:

By default, OpenDJ directory server supports the following Connection Handler types:

I noticed this at https://qa-backstage.forgerock.com/docs/opendj/4/reference#dsconfig-get-connection-handler-prop  where all options are followed by this paragraph. 

It makes documentation less readable and I think it increases the size of documentation for no reason. It can be one root cause of performance issue OPENDJ-3145 .
