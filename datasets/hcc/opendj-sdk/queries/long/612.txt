I believe that this is the cause of the unit tests hanging although it's impossible to prove since any attempts to add debugging cause the tests to pass.

Grizzly devs have suggested an approach using SockectConnectorHandler for dealing with client connects:


SocketConnectorHandler connectorHandler = 
                    TCPNIOConnectorHandler.builder(transport)
                    .processor(clientFilterChain)
                    .build();
            
Future<Connection> future = connectorHandler.connect("localhost", PORT);



However there is no equivalent for binds. This missing functionality is being tracked by GRIZZLY-1346 (http://java.net/jira/browse/GRIZZLY-1346) and require an upgrade to Grizzly 2.3.
