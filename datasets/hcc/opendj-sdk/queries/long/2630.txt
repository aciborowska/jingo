Running OpenAM AuthN stress with DJ3.0.0 as a CTS we get the following error


[15/Jan/2016:15:15:12 +0100] SEARCH REQ conn=71 op=2 msgID=3 base="dc=com" scope=sub filter="(objectClass=*)" attrs="coreTokenId"
access.20160115141737Z:[15/Jan/2016:15:15:13 +0100] SEARCH RES conn=71 op=2 msgID=3 result=80 message="Unable to examine the entry with ID 11510 for sorting purposes: NullPointerException(EntryContainer.java:2663)" nentries=0 etime=394638135




It looks like we were using a custom version of OpenAM12.0.2 to try to make the CTS Reaper use a VLV control instead of relying on a ordering index to find expired entries.

However the VLV index was apparently not configured on DJ side.

Will try to provide some more infos later
