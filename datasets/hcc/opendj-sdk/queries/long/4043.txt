Just last week this backup command was working but recently the flag --recurringTask "00 02 * * 0" is causing an error as shown below (nonexistent calendar date). In addition these flags are also erring in the same way --recurringTask "00 02 * * 1" and --recurringTask "00 02 * * 2". 

Strangely, when using --recurringTask "00 02 * * 3" the command executes successfully.
