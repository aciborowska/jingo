When buildingÂ the 5.5.1 tag from the General Access ds-customer-ga 5.5.1 tag using customer credentials, the build fails as it can't find the sustaining/5.5 branch;


[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.forgerock.commons:forgerock-doc-maven-plugin:4.0.1:process (build-man-pages) on project opendj-doc-generated-ref: Unable to execute mojo: Impossible to perform scm diff sustaining/5.5 . command because fatal: ambiguous argument 'sustaining/5.5': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.



This will prevent customers (one particuar one was mentioned in a slack conversation about this) from building the code.
