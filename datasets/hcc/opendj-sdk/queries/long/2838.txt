GSSAPI binding with OpenDJ's
ldapsearch command (at least) requires typing a password
even though I have already gotten a TGT from our KDC.
OpenLDAP, in comparison, uses the TGT to get a service ticket
and bind without password prompting, which is what I would
expect (right?)

OpenDJ 2.4.3
============


~:barnowl> kinit
Password for jblaine@RCF.OUR.ORG:
~:barnowl> /tmp/OpenDJ-2.4.3/bin/ldapsearch -h rcf-ldap1.our.org -b
dc=rcf,dc=our,dc=org -o mech=GSSAPI -o authid=jblaine@RCF.OUR.ORG
uid=jblaine
Password for user 'jblaine@RCF.OUR.ORG':

Note that afterward with OpenDJ, klist shows that I did not
get a service ticket for ldap/rcf-ldap1.our.org@RCF.OUR.ORG

as I'd expect.
