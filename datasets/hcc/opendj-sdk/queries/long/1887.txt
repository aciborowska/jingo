Since OPENDJ-435, there is no default base DN value prompted to the user when he runs setup in interactive mode. It might be good to have one (e.g dc=example,dc=com) to allow quick tests and to be consistent with the setup UI mode.

Of course, changes introduced by OPENDJ-435 will be not impacted. So the added default value will be activated only on the prompt (i.e in interactive mode).
