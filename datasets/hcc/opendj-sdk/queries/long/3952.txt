During functional tests, I noticed that a control OID is not logged. We use custom OIDs to quickly identify a message in a log file and we set criticality to false to don't hit any error about non-existent OID.

This happens with CSV log publisher and also with Legacy log publisher.
We only set each publisher to log control oid by enabling the log-control-oids property.

Once the property is set we run a LDAP search with custom oid:

./bin/ldapsearch -h pyforge.example.com -p 1389 -D "uid=user.10,ou=Legacy,dc=com" -w password -T -b "ou=Legacy,dc=com" -J 3.1.1.1.1.0:false "uid=user.0"



I can see the log message in the log, but the used oid (3.1.1.1.1.0) is not presented.
I tried to restart each log publisher, just in case the change hasn't been take into account.

NOTE: same scenario works with OpenDJ-4.0.0
