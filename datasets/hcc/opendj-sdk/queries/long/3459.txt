I noticed that ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism is no more supported by ldapsearch.
The command looks like:

./opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h pyforge.example.com -p 1389 -b dc=example,dc=com -o mech=ANONYMOUS -o trace=Trace -s base '(objectclass=*)'



The output is:

An error occurred while parsing the command-line arguments:  The requested
SASL mechanism "ANONYMOUS" is not supported by this client

See "ldapsearch --help" to get more usage help



I installed OpenDJ-4.0.0 and enabled SASL mechanism handler:

./opendj/bin/dsconfig -h pyforge.example.com -p 4444 -D cn=myself -w password -X set-sasl-mechanism-handler-prop --handler-name "ANONYMOUS" --set "enabled:true" -n


and after that I have run ldapsearch command above.

_NOTE: run attached script to reproduce the error ^^ _
