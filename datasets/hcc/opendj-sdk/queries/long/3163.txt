Found with 3.5.0-M4

I have a server, setup with generated data.
Following the documentation, I was aiming at creating a new http endpoint and got the following problem:


./dsconfig  create-http-endpoint  --hostname localhost  --port 4444  --bindDN "cn=Directory Manager"  --bindPassword password  --endpoint-name /rest  --type rest2ldap-endpoint  --set config-url:config/config/http-config.json 

The Rest2ldap Endpoint could not be created because of the following reason:

    *  The HTTP Authorization Mechanism "cn=HTTP Basic,cn=HTTP Authorization
       Mechanisms,cn=config" referenced in property "authorization-mechanism"
       does not exist



It looks like default value should be HTTP Basic.
