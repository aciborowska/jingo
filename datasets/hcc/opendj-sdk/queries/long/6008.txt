Steps to reproduce:
1. Install a fresh OpenDJ instance (setup with a "DSEE compatible" (i.e ACI based) access control handler by default)
2. Delete the access control handler so that we can use a policy based one:

bin/dsconfig delete-access-control-handler \
          --hostname localhost \
          --port 4444 \
          --bindDn cn=Directory\ Manager \
          --trustAll \
          --bindPassword password \
          --no-prompt



3. Create a policy based ACH:

	Interactive mode:

>>>> Access Control Handler management menu

What would you like to do?

    1)  Create a new Access Control Handler
    2)  View and edit the Access Control Handler
    3)  Delete an existing Access Control Handler
    4)  Show the Access Control Handler

    a)  show advanced components and properties
    q)  quit
    b)  back

Enter choice [b]: 1


>>>> Select the type of Access Control Handler that you want to create:

    1)  DSEE Compatible Access Control Handler
    2)  Policy Based Access Control Handler

    a)  show advanced components and properties
    q)  quit
    c)  cancel
    ?)  help

Enter choice [c]: 2

[...]
Enter choice [f]:

        Property  Value(s)

    1)  enabled   true

    a)  show advanced components and properties
    q)  quit
    c)  cancel
    f)  finish - create the new Access Control Handler
    ?)  help

Enter choice [f]: 

The Policy Based Access Control Handler could not be created because there is
already an existing one with the same name

Expected behavior: dsconfig works as expected and access control is now performed using the following global policies:

$ bin/dsconfig list-global-access-control-policies           --hostname localhost           --port 4444           --bindDn cn=Directory\ Manager           --trustAll           --bindPassword password           --no-prompt

Global Access Control Policy
--------------------------------
Anonymous access all entries
Authenticated access all entries
Root DSE access
Schema access
Self access



Observed behavior:
dsconfig prints a verbose error message and fall back on the same menu as before, when the user choose f)  finish - create the new Access Control Handler a second time, dsconfig reports that there is already one configured, so the user can be completely lost.
In effect, the message printed is a warning, the ACH is created but with the Root DSE access policy missing.


	Non interactive mode behaves as the interactive one:

$ bin/dsconfig create-access-control-handler           --type policy-based           --set enabled:true           --hostname localhost           --port 4444           --bindDn cn=Directory\ Manager           --trustAll           --bindPassword password           --no-prompt

Invalid Attribute Syntax: Entry "cn=Root DSE access,cn=Global Access Control
Policies,cn=Access Control Handler,cn=config" contains a value "" for
attribute ds-cfg-request-target-dn-equal-to that is invalid according to the
syntax for that attribute: The provided value "" is not allowed for attributes
with syntax 'DirectoryString'. It neither match the syntax nor an expression.

$ echo $?
1





Note that alternative consists in stopping the server and use the dsconfig offline mode to do the change.
Issue is caused by OPENDJ-3860 and the fact that switching the ACH is now possible whereas it was forbidden  before the issue resolution.

Issue cause is the fact that schema validation is performed against global policies definitions when server is online and the empty DN representing the Root DSE entry for attribute ds-cfg-request-target-dn-equal-to is getting rejected by DirectoryStringSyntaxImpl#valueIsAcceptable.
