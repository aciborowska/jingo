Reproduced on OpenDJ 3.5.3 ONLY, does not seem to affect earlier versions.

Steps to reproduce.

	Remove existing truststore, if one exists (rm ~/.opendj/gui-keystore)
	Launch control panel, attempt to connect to a remote 3.5.3 instance
	Control panel refuses to connect (with SSL handshake error attached)



Observations:

	After the first connection attempt the gui-keystore is created. Subsequent attempts then seem to connect OK.
	Launching the control panel with the --trustAll flag bypasses any cert issues and always connects.
