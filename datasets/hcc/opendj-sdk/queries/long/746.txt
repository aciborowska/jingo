OpenDJ nightly tests have been moved to a new machine which has lots of memory and cpu cores (32).
On this machine the InitOnlineTests of replication have been failing consistently.
After investigation, there is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown deep in the indexing code. The exception cause the import to be cancelled and fails the tests.
The issue lies on line 1852 of jeb/importLDIF/Importer.java. When we need to add a key to the index, we check if there's enough space. However, it is not considered the case where there isn't but the key size also exceeds a complete buffer size.

We need to fix this bug, add a specific test for that problem, and also fix the InitOnlineTest to avoid using large values of an attribute that is indexed by default (this is not the goal of that specific unit test).
