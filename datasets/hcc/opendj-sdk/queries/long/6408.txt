Querying BackupBackend with a given backup id does not work and return an error.

Steps to reproduce

Let server be installed at /home/jdoe/opendj


./bin/start-ds

./bin/backup  --hostname opendj.example.com  --port 4444  --bindDN "uid=admin"  --bindPassword password  --backendId appData  --backupId foo  --backupDirectory ./bak  --start 0  --trustAll

./bin/ldapsearch -p 1389 -D "uid=admin" -w password -b "ds-backup-id=foo,ds-backup-directory-path=/home/jdoe/opendj/bak,cn=backups" "(&)"



Actual result



# The LDAP search request failed: 80 (Other)
# Additional Information:  An unexpected error was encountered while processing a search in one of the Directory Server backends: The attribute description "archive_file" could not be parsed because it contains an invalid character "_" at position 7



Expected result

The backup entry corresponding to the given backupId

Notes

This probably comes from the fact, the BackupBackend converts straight metadata of the backup from the backup.info file and these metadata are not compatible with the expected response format.
