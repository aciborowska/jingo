While doing the final tests for svr4 packaging an endless loop has been encountered in JavaInstallHelper#getBestEffortArguments - if dsjavaproperties always returns an error (e.g. if the JVM does not support the non-standard option -Xmx, etc): it will try '
INFO: Checking if options -Xmx0m are supported with java home: /usr/jdk/instances/jdk1.7.0/jre' forever and fills up the log pretty fast.

Also there is IMHO a security problem: ...quicksetup.util/Utils#supportsOption
logs all env vars currently set. And since the log file is readable by everyone, it may expose security related information like passwords etc. (some apps allow one to set a env var to avoid exposing passwords to other users via ps etc., ipmitool)... I think, unsetting all unneeded vars in _script_utils is the best way to avoid exposing sensitive information to the public [by accident] and avoid putting the burden on the user ...
