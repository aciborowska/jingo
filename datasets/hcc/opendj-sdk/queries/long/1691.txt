The ACI Targets section of the Admin Guide makes it look like you can use multiple targets separated with a comma, as in:



(targetattr = "attr-list"), (targetattr != "attr-list")



This seems to be an artifact of HTML output, whereas these are actually alternate forms. This might be written like this instead for example.



(targetattr [!]= "attr-list")
