Support Extract tests with enable gc log failed at clu_group at daily tests. It could be due to machine are just not big enough (memory) to manage that.

Link on daily clu_group: https://ci.forgerock.org/view/OpenDJ/job/OpenDJ-7.0.x/job/test_daily/397/GROUP=clu_group,label=func_windows/

Run only SupportExtract suite on pyforge_tests_debug_windows, link here https://ci.forgerock.org/view/PyForge/job/pyforge_tests_debug_windows/322/
