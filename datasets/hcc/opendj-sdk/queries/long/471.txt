We've got report of case where a modification to an entry appeared to be dropped after some time, when the entry was modified again. Since the entry was large (a group with many members), it was easier to spot on the loss of a value.
The FIFOEntryCache was enabled, but the issue only occurred infrequently.
I was able to reproduce it only once in a series of loops while adding members to a group. Looking at the code of the FIFOEntryCache, we found that there's a possibility that the server does not update the FIFOEntryCache after modifying an entry, and leaves the obsolete copy in the cache.

The FIFOEntryCache should be deprecated. Its FIFO algorithm fails to be of interest if entries are reused. 
When absolutely needing an entry cache, the SoftReferenceEntryCache should be preferred.
