Found using OpenDJ 2.8.0 (revision 12559).

Currently after adding a new suffix and enabling replication on this suffix, search on cn=changelog with changelogcookie control fails with the following error:

Full resync required because the provided cookie is missing the replicated domain(s) o=new_suffix_repl:;



And print the new cookie to use.

This exception/error is no longer valid wtih the new implementation.
