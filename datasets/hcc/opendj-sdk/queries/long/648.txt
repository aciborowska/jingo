Trivial improvement to dsjavaproperties:

Regarding the issue with dsjavaproperties:

I changed "NO_CHECK=0" into "NO_CHECK=1" in dsjavaproperties because the
ownership of the instance shouldn't be relevant when calling
dsjavaproperties.

AFAIK, the tool should only be able to write to lib/set-java-home and this
simple modification (NO_CHECK=1) allows dsjavaproperties to be ran as
root or any other user who has write access to lib/set-java-home.
