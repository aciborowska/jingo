While resolving OPENDJ-7236 I noticed that the last cancelled operation is logged after the disconnect log message. This is because org.opends.server.protocols.ldap.LdapClientConnection#finalizeDisconnection is invoked when the search completes org.opends.server.protocols.ldap.LdapClientConnection#removeOperationInProgress but before the search has a chance to log anything.
