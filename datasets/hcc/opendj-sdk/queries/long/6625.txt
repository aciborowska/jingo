I am unable to use `uid=admin` and `password` as credentials when running commands on opendj(running on docker).
 To reproduce run:


./run-pybot.py -c cloud -n -v -s ds_docker_group dj

After running this command you should be able to connect to the docker container
 Then try to run `dsconfig` with `uid=admin` and `password`

Expected result:
 you should be able to use dsconfig now
 Actual result:


Unable to proceed, invalid credentials
