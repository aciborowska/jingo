Found with automated stress job (1 hour run) and reproduced only on lab machine with increasing time (3 hours run) and concurrency from 10 to 20.

Version and revision: 7.0.0-SNAPSHOT 4895248f4ae.

This job use DS1-RS1-RS2-DS2 topology and 2 modrate clients are running during the test. First modrate stress DS1 with modificaitons and second modrate sends modifications on  DS2.

At the end of the test there is a check:
1. the ds-sync-state  is in sync - this is ok
2. the servers are in sycn - dsreplication status output - this is ok too
3. the lastChangeNumbers are stable on each server (there are no updates) - this is ok
4. the changenumbers are in sync accross all the servers - this is not ok

With 4th check on changenumbers we have divergence: 

RS1 => lastChangeNumber=215718908
RS2 => lastChangeNumber=215719064



The environment with reproduced issue is still on brie machine. 

I don't see errors in logs.

Checking the Grafana dashboard I can see that current delay is increasing up to ~42 minutes. (See attached image).

Command to reproduce this issue (probably not possible to reproduce on someones machine):
Use following in [Stress] section in config.cfg:


[Stress]
num_users = 100000
duration = 10800
concurrency = 20
max_throughput = -1

python3 run-pybot.py -n -v -c stress -s replication_split_dsrs opendj
