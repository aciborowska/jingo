Currently the logs are not written to `/webapp/WEB-INF/logs`, but to `/tools/wrapper/bin/webapp/WEB-INF/logs`. This is confirmed to be the case when running eXist as a service, or at least installed as upstart daemon. The cause lies in the new log4j configuration for the wrapper, in `/tools/wrapper/conf/log4j2.xml`.
