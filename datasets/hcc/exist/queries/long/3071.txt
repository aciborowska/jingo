### What is the problem

The function `fn:random-number-generator` is not compliant to the xquery 3.1 specification.

Specifically:
1. The seed can be of type `xs:anyAtomic` but only `xs:number` is supported because it is internally cast to `java.long` https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/blob/cdefdee3263b3e68e37abc3ad6893b30fc7682c6/exist-core/src/main/java/org/exist/xquery/functions/fn/FnRandomNumberGenerator.java#L43
2. There is a side-effect with the function returned in the `next` key.
