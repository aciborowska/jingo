### What is the problem

This is a possible bug which was found at the XML Summer School in the XQuery class taught by @adamretter 

An XQuery that attempts to match a path and return either the result of a function or the empty sequence, using an idiom for "if present then something else empty sequence", appears to be returning incorrect results in eXist-db 4.3.1. 

### What did you expect

Using this query:

```xquery
let $doc := <root><example>test</example></root>
return (
  $doc/element(example)/true(),
  $doc/example/true(),
  $doc/element(other)/true(),
  $doc/other/true(),
  $doc/example/string('hello'),
  $doc/other/string('hello')
)
```

The expected result, as produced by BaseX 9.0.2, is:

```
true
true
hello
```

The result produced by eXist-db 4.3.1 is:

```
true
true
true
true
hello
hello
```

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test

As above.
