```xquery
let $block :=
<a>
    <z>
        <b></b>
    </z>
    <c>
        <b></b>
    </c>
</a>

return $block//*[name(.) eq 'b'][1]
```

This only returns 1 `<b>` element in eXist-db. It should return both `<b>` elements.
I have tested this in BaseX and Saxon and they are correct, whereas eXist-db is not.
