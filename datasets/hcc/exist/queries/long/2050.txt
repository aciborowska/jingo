
### What is the problem
> If I remember correctly, prior to version 4.3 calling a templating function like this
 `<div class="some:function"/>` 
resulted in an error being thrown immediately, indicating that the given function does not exist. Right now, using 4.3, the server does not respond within a reasonable amount of time, I can see in Monex that a query is running (view.xql) but it won't return, I need to kill it manually.

### What did you expect
> I expected to get the error message I used to get, instead of the query hanging

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
> Just try calling a non-existent function using templating
