Easy way to reproduce (submitted by @jensopetersen ):
- clone exist-develop
- build.sh 
- install a few apps from the package manager (imo not needed)
- backup from the Dashboard
- clean build of the installation
- restore the backup through rpc (ie using backup.sh or JAC)

Leads to:

It still works with commit #927, but since #928 the problems appear.
