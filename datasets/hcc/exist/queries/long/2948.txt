### What is the problem
ft:query throws a NullpointerException in the console if executed against a collection with an erroneous collection.xconf (the <index> element was missing) while in eXide  no error is visible.

### What did you expect
A more meaningfull error message to get an idea about the underlaying cause. 

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
Take any XML you like, create a collection.xconf for it without an <index> element and afterwards run a ft:query against the XML in that collection.
