- Settings chosen on install time, eg max_memory, is not reflected in tools/yajsw/conf/wrapper.conf making the db be run with default memory allocation, currently 1024 MB by the wrapper.
- No dynamic wrapper.conf settings at all from template wrapper.conf.install were expanded on unix platforms.
- The wrapper is always running as a privileged user eventhough eXist-db can be run as non-privileged user if specified in tools/yajsw/conf/wrapper.conf.
- Documentation is still referring to the old service wrapper so clients have problem installing the wrapper at all.
