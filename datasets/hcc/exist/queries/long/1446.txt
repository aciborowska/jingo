Let's say I'm using the API:

       `org.xmldb.api.base.Collection.createResource(String, String)`

to create a resource and then use the method:

      `org.xmldb.api.base.Resource.setContent(Object)`

to set a `java.io.File` object to the Resource.
After calling:

          `org.xmldb.api.base.Collection.storeResource(Resource)`

the file remains locked on disk, for example it cannot be deleted anymore on Windows. Possibly this happens because you are not closing the FileInputStream which you are probably using internally to read the file contents.
