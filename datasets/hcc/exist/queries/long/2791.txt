### What is the problem
Calling `mvn package -DskipTests` twice fails with an error. If `mvn clean package -DskipTests` and running eXist-db from $EXIST/exist-distribution/target/exist-distribution-5.0.0-RC8-SNAPSHOT-dir/ will delete the current database and install a new version into exist-distribution-5.0.0-RC8-SNAPSHOT-dir/


### What did you expect
To be able to execute `mvn package -DskipTests` without any error and without loosing the existing database. 
 
### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
call `mvn package -DskipTests` twice.
