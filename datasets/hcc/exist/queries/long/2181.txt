### What is the problem

The `fn:parse-xml-fragment()` function (added by @claudius108 in https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/158) is returning items of the wrong type and arity.

### What did you expect

According to https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#func-parse-xml-fragment, the function's signature is:

```xquery
fn:parse-xml-fragment($arg as xs:string?) as document-node()?
```

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test

The following query should return `true()` but returns `false()`

```xquery
parse-xml-fragment("He was <i>so</i> kind") instance of document-node()
```

The following query should return `1` but returns `3`

```xquery
count(parse-xml-fragment("He was <i>so</i> kind"))
```

Saxon and BaseX return the expected results. Only eXist returns the incorrect results.
