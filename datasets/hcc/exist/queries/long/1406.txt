There is a bug in the implementation of `org.exist.dom.persistent.DefaultDocumentSet#contains(org.exist.dom.persistent.DocumentSet)` where it checks the contents of the set against itself.

See https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/blob/develop/src/org/exist/dom/persistent/DefaultDocumentSet.java#L187

I have no idea why we don't see real problems from this...
