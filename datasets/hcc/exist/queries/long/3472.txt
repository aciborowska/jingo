**Describe the bug**

The expression `array {}` raises the following error: 

> Index 0 out of bounds for length 0

**Expected behavior**

The expression is valid and should not raise an error. 

(Note that the error also lacks location information.)

**To Reproduce**

Evaluate a query containing the expression `array {}`. Given the following query:

```xquery
xquery version "3.1";

array {}
```

eXist returns the following error:

> Index 0 out of bounds for length 0

BaseX and Saxon return the expected result:

> `[]`
