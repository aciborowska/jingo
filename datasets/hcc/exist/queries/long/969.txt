(See src/../xquery/functions/system/FnExport.java)
The documentation for this function says "Restore the database or a section of the database" - when in fact this function generates a backup file or directory.

The $dir-or-file parameter should be $target-directory - "The destination for the backup - this directory must be writeable by the database process".
The other parameters are correct.

The associated error message should refer to "export" and not "restore"
