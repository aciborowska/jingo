As described in https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/938 I tried to adjust the fop config for the tei-simple-pm app (https://github.com/wolfgangmm/tei-simple-pm).

I changed the fop config in fo.xql (https://github.com/wolfgangmm/tei-simple-pm/blob/master/modules/fo.xql)  as follows: 
- removed <font-base> base from the config
- changed  <font embed-url="Junicode.ttf" ../> to "<font embed-url="exist://localhost:8080/db/apps/tei-simple/resources/fonts/Junicode.ttf"/>

This results in the following error: javax.servlet.ServletException: An error occurred: URI scheme is not "file". 

Am I doing something wrong? I tried various combinations as embed-url, with and without port 8080, http as url scheme, but nothing worked.
