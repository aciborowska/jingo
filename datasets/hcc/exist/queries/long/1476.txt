### What is the problem

```xquery

let $xml:= <a/>
return $xml/blah/local-name()
```
raises an error instead of returning empty sequence

err:XPDY0002 Undefined context item

### What did you expect

Expected behaviour is the same as if the context item was explicitly passed as local-name()'s argument.

```xquery
let $xml:= <a/>
return $xml/blah/local-name(.)
```

### Context information
Please always add the following information
tested on eXist-db 3.2.0 (Windows) and 3.0RC2 (Linux)
