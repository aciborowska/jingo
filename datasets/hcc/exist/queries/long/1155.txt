I would expect the following query to fail, because `empty()` is not a type declaration:

``` xquery
xquery version "3.1";

let $item := ()
return
    typeswitch ($item)
    case empty() return
        'empty!?'
    default return
        'default'
```

eXist allows this through and in fact returns `empty!?`. This is using a current build of the develop branch.
