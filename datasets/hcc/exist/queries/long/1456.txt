### What is the problem

The following query worked in eXist 2.2 but fails on eXist 3.x:

```xquery
xquery version "3.0";

xmldb:store(
    '/db', 
    'image.jpg', 
    xs:anyURI('https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png'), 
    'image/png'
)
```

The error in eXide in eXist 3.3.0-DEVELOP:

> exerr:ERROR IOException while reading from URL: https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png [at line 3, column 1]

In my application (where I first saw this), my try-catch block's `$err:description` reports this before the IOException:

> java:java.nio.file.FileAlreadyExistsException module: (114,35) /Users/joe/workspace/exist/tools/jetty/tmp/existDBS396998373878243953.xml.

But no such file exists in that location.

It looks like the last change to xmldb:store was @adamretter's commit of Oct 15, 2016 that changed src/org/exist/xquery/functions/xmldb/XMLDBStore.java (starting around ~line 286): https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/commit/c0b66cecad66cd6f00c91d12301914f65e42cf39#diff-1ae2fca2d57a1afd1fa116bb2548908e.

### What did you expect

I expected xmldb:store to allow remote binary resources to be stored, as stated in the function documentation. (See http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/fundocs/view.html?uri=http://exist-db.org/xquery/xmldb#store.3.)

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test

See the query above.

### Context information

- eXist-db version: 3.3.0-DEVELOP a059dec22 (for 2.2, I tested on exist-db.org's eXide)
- Java version: 8u121
- Operating system: macOS 10.12.5
