Using a `VarRef` with an atomic value where a `StepExpr` is expected results in an error, even though it is allowed by the spec.

For example,

``` xquery
declare variable $test := 2;
<a/>/$test
```

results in "exerr:ERROR cannot convert xs:integer('2') to a node set". The expected result is 2.

Using an atomic `Literal` value works as expected (eg. `<a/>/2` returns 2)
