### What is the problem

An unexpected error is raised when using the arrow operator:

```xquery
xquery version "3.1";

"hello" => replace("llo", "y")
```

The error (in eXide):

> exerr:EXXQDY0001 Internal error: function argument placeholder not expanded. [source: xquery version "3.1"; "hello" => replace("llo", "y")] In function: replace(xs:string?, xs:string, xs:string) [-1:-1:String]

### What did you expect

I expected the result `hey` - the result of the equivalent expression `replace("hello", "llo", "y")`.

See https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/#id-arrow-operator.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test

See above. I also tested in BaseX, which returns the expected result, `hey`.
