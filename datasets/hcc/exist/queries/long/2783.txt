### What is the problem
The httpclient (`hc:send-request`) throws err:ERROR on an empty resource. While other resources with status code 404 seems to be no problem.

### What did you expect
response header and no second item in the returning sequence

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
```xq
xquery version "3.1";
hc:send-request(<hc:request href="https://d-nb.info/gnd/117444839/about/rdf" method="get"/>)
```
eXist 3.5.0 returns an empty sequence, what is not what i expect as there is no information on the response headers, but at least there is no error.
eXist 5.0.0-RC8 throws `exerr:ERROR Header is not content type [at line 2, column 1]`

### Context information
- eXist-db 5.0.0-RC8 pulled from docker hub (tag latest)
