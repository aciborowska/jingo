**Describe the bug**

`"0" castable as xs:QName` should return `false()`, and it does so in BaseX and Saxon, but in eXist it returns `true()`. 

(Oddly, eXist recognizes that `"0" castable as xs:NCName` is `false()`. I say "oddly," because QName consists of either a single NCName or 2 NCNames joined by a colon.)

**Expected behavior**

`"0" castable as xs:QName` should return `false()`

For more context, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QName and https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names/#ns-qualnames.

**To Reproduce**

```xquery
xquery version "3.1";

module namespace t="http://exist-db.org/xquery/test";

declare namespace test="http://exist-db.org/xquery/xqsuite";

declare
    %test:assertFalse
function t:test() {
    "0" castable as xs:QName
};
```
