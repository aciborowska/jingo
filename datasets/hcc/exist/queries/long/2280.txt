### What is the problem
LDAPRealm findAllGroupMembers is also called with built-in groups as parameter. Searching these in LDAP [results in a null return](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/blob/develop/extensions/security/ldap/src/org/exist/security/realm/ldap/LDAPRealm.java#L1240) which is not checked but [subseqently just used as an object](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/blob/develop/extensions/security/ldap/src/org/exist/security/realm/ldap/LDAPRealm.java#L1242)

### What did you expect
Either that this function is only called on groups from the LDAP realm or that it handles null returns as not found gracefully.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test

1. Configure LDAP
1. Let exist read the users from the DB
1. Try to change access rights using the GUI client
1. Edit Properties Error: Could not get dba group members: Failed to invoke method getGroupMembers in class org.exist.xmlrpc.RpcConnection: null
