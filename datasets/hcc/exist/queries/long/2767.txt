### What is the problem
Restoring a backup created with current develop will result in all binary files missing. It doesn't matter if you restore into a remote or local instance. 

The `__contents__.xml` descriptors inside the backup are missing entries for all binary files.

Backup/restore was tested extensively not long ago, so this bug must have been introduced very recently.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
A backup is attached. On a fresh database, install a package which is not contained by default, e.g. the demo app. Create a backup via the dashboard and check the `__contents__.xml` files contained inside. They should be missing entries for all binary resources. Restoring the backup will thus miss all binary resources.
