If you install OpenJDK 11 on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS, then install eXist-db as a service to systemd using `tools/yajsw/bin/installDaemon.sh`. eXist-db will not start under systemd. You will see repeated messages about the pid file in the systemd output. Seems to be a problem with YAJSW.

Using OpenJDK 8 everything works fine.
