### What is the problem
> I am attempting to use the KWIC module to give me information on full text searches that are run against my exist instance. This all works fine but occasionally I also want to add additional filters on other, non-full text fields. While the search itself works in this instance, the KWIC module returns nothing. I can reproduce this same behaviour using the eXist-db Shakespeare demo. For example:

**Standard xQuery**
```
xquery version "3.1";
import module namespace kwic="http://exist-db.org/xquery/kwic";
for $x in doc("db/apps/demo/data/hamlet.xml")//PLAY/ACT/SCENE
where $x//SPEECH[ft:query(.,"alas mad lady")] 
order by ft:score($x) descending
return
<page>
<data>{$x}</data>
<match>
{kwic:summarize($x, <config width="40"/>)}
</match>
</page>
```

> This query works as expected. However if I add additional criteria to the where clause (e.g. $x//SPEAKER = 'HAMLET', kwic:summarize no longer returns results, even though there are results in the query itself (and there are still full-text matches). For example:

**xQuery with Additional Where Criteria**
```
xquery version "3.1";
import module namespace kwic="http://exist-db.org/xquery/kwic";
for $x in doc("db/apps/demo/data/hamlet.xml")//PLAY/ACT/SCENE
where $x//SPEECH[ft:query(.,"alas mad lady")] and $x//SPEAKER = 'HAMLET'
order by ft:score($x) descending
return
<page>
<data>{$x}</data>
<match>
{kwic:summarize($x, <config width="40"/>)}
</match>
</page>
```

> This query returns results in the <data> node but the <match> node is now empty (despite valid full-text matches existing and thus KWIC should provide a summary).

### What did you expect
> Regardless of the criteria supplied in the where clause, I should be see a kwic:summarize if there are matching keywords from the full-text criteria.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
> Steps to reproduce:

1. Open the public eXide application (http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/eXide/index.html)
2. Run the "Standard xQuery" from above. Verify results in <match> node exist.
3. Run the "xQuery with Additional Where Criteria" from above. Verify <match> node is now empty.

### Context information
> My local environment is configured as follows:

> Please always add the following information
- eXist-db version + Git Revision hash e.g. eXist-db 3.0 /  acd0c14 : 4.4.0
- Java version (e.g. Java8u121): 1.8.0_181
- Operating system (Windows 7, Linux, MacOs): OS X 10.14.1
- 32 or 64 bit: 64 bit
- How is eXist-db installed? (JAR installer, DMG, WAR file, clone from GitHub): DMG
- Any custom changes in e.g. conf.xml: Only custom change is the full-text index on the data. However, since this is reproducible in the eXist-db public demo, I doubt my ft index configuration is relevant.
