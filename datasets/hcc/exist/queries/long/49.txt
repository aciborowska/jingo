Environment: ubuntu 13.04 64-bit, OpenJDK 7, latest exist from git

Steps to reproduce:
1) Activate spatial module in $build-dir/extensions/indexes/local.build.properties
2) ./build.sh download-additional-jars
3) ./build.sh all

The end of the compile looks like this

```
compile-src:
     [echo] Compiling sources 'index-spatial'

```

Also, note that the fetch url in $build-dir/extensions/indexes/spatial/extension.xml pointing to geoapi-nogenerics-2.1.1.jar (line 19) gets a 404. The file is available at the osgeo.org location used elsewhere in the file.
