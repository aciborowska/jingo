If an atomic `Literal` value is used as a `StepExpr` in a `RelativePathExpr`, the results are different when working on in-memory nodes than with a stored document.

For example, given a document "test.xml" that contains

``` xml
<a>
   <b/>
   <b/>
</a>
```

the query `doc('/db/test.xml')//b/3` evaluates to a single 3, whereas `(<a><b/><b/></a>)//b/3` evaluates to a sequence of _two_ 3's
