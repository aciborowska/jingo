**Describe the bug**

In eXist, errors involving type comparisons like `1 eq "2"` lack location information.

**Expected behavior**

I expected the errors to report the location of the error in the query, as they do in BaseX and Saxon.

**To Reproduce**

**Query 1**

```xquery
xquery version "3.1"; 

1 eq "2"
```

eXist error:

> err:XPTY0004 can not compare xs:string('1') with xs:integer('2')

BaseX returns the error at the end of the expression containing the error:

> Stopped at /Users/joe/Downloads/file, 3/9:
> 
> [XPTY0004] Types xs:integer and xs:string are not comparable.

Saxon reports the error as appearing at the first character of the expression containing the error:

> In {1 eq "2"}: cannot compare xs:integer to xs:string
> 
> Start location: 3:2

**Query 2**

```xquery
xquery version "3.1"; 

1 = "2"
```

eXist error: 

> err:XPTY0004 Incompatible primitive types

BaseX error:

> Stopped at /Users/joe/Downloads/file, 3/8:
> 
> [XPTY0004] Types xs:integer and xs:string are not comparable.

Saxon error:

> In {1 = "2"}: cannot compare xs:integer to xs:string
> 
> Start location: 3:2
