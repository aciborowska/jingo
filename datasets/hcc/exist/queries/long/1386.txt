### What is the problem
> xqDoc annotations that contain an ``@`` are not processed correctly by ``inspect:inspect-module`` the fault is somewhere here i guess `` exist/src/org/exist/xquery/functions/inspect/InspectModule.java``

### What did you expect
> ``@see`` or ``@returns`` comments can contain ``@`` as part of the annotation, (email address and attributes) but the function stops at the character immediately before the ``@``

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
> add xqDoc comment to function and run `inspect:inspect-module` on the module, e.g.:
```xQuery
(:~
: this â€¦
: @return taxonomy[@type = "reign"]
:)
```

will become
```xml
 <returns type="item()" cardinality="zero or more"> taxonomy[</returns>
```

instead of:
```xml
 <returns type="item()" cardinality="zero or more">taxonomy[@type = "reign"]</returns>
```
