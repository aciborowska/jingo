Using `/` or `//` at the start of a `PathExpr` in a predicate when working with stored documents results in an evaluation error, even when the equivalent `root(self::node())` does not.

For example, `collection('/db')[/]` results in the error "exerr:ERROR Internal evaluation error: context is missing for node 0 ! [source: String]", but `collection('/db')[root(self::node())]` returns the entire db as expected. `collection('/db')[//project]` results in a similar error.

Interestingly, although `collection('/db')[project]` works, `collection('/db')[project ! /]` does not (similar context error).

On the other hand, `<test/>[/]` (and all variations with `//` and `root()`) returns `<test/>` as expected.
