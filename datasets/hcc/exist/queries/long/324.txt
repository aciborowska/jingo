If the evaluation of the parameters of `string-join()` triggers an error, the error gets overriden and is reported instead as a dynamic type mismatch.

In the following test-case `err:XPTY0004` is returned instead of `error`.

Tested with version 2.2RC2 and 2.1.

``` xquery
xquery version "3.0";

declare function local:x() as xs:string { error(xs:QName('error')), 'x' };

try {
   string-join(( 'a', local:x() ))
} catch * {
   $err:code
}
```
