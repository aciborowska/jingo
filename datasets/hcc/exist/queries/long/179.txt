With multiple files selected in the Java admin client, opening the Properties window always shows the permissions for the selected files as rw-rw-rw-, regardless of the actual permissions of the selected files.

Notice here that the original files are rw-r--r--, but the Java admin client shows the permissions as rw-rw-rw-.  

A better approach would be to pick up the actual properties of the selected items. This should be straightforward if the properties are identical. If not identical, then it would make sense to display the overlapping set of properties. Even better, some UIs allow for a "gray dash" mark over the property checkbox that are not common across all the items; then the user can click once to turn all on, again to turn all off, or not at all to leave the original properties unchanged. I'm not sure if this UI element is available to the Java admin client though.
