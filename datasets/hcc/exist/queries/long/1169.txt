when `util:log-system-out("hahaha")`  is called from a not-stored-query, also the query itself is printed to standard out, giving a lot of noise.

e.g. the above yields into 

```
(Line: 1 util:log-system-out("hahaha")) hahaha
```

whilst I'd expect

```
(Line: 1 String) hahaha
```

the cause is in org.exist.xquery.AbstractExpression#getSource line 121:

```java
if(getSource() != null && getSource().getKey() != null) {
  buf.append(" ");
  buf.append(getSource().getKey());
}
```

as far as I see `getSource().getKey()` returns the whole query string, which does not make sense to me?
