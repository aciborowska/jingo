I asked this on exist-open without response ( I should be the only one with this problem??):
- after pulling latest commits on Nov 4 and rebuild my existdb installations are suffering from backup
  failure;  cron and dashboard initiated backups only; cmdln backups with backup.sh are ok.
- tons of error in exist.log: found orphaned document
- the resulting backup is nearly empty (1,7kB). 
   NB. The log file in export dir tells nothing about this, the run seems complete
 
same problem with fresh existdb from github source (3.0RC2 develop branch), 
only basic apps, no additional app/data
