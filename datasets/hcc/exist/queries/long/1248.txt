When I first run eXist-db.app using current nightly builds on macOS, the eXist-db icon that appears in my dock doesn't close when I quit eXist via the menu bar.  It seems the only way to get this icon to go away is to control-click on it and select quit.  

This is odd, since it's not associated with the eXist-db process. It seems harmless but will certainly confuse users. 

The "normal" behavior I would expect from eXist-db is that the dock icon appears briefly and then disappears after the menu bar icon appears.  

Since this persistent dock icon only appears once - on first run of a new installation - my hunch is that this is somehow related to something that only happens on first run and not subsequent runs.  But I'm not sure what it is.
