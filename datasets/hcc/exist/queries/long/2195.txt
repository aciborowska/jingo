Thank you for reporting your issue!

To be able to better understand you problem or suggestion, please add as much information as possible to this ticket. When there is no or just little information, it will be too difficult to work on it (and hence we will not be able to solve it)

Please fill in the following sections:

### What is the problem
> Describe exactly what you see (e.g. an output of an XQuery) 

Since #2138 I am experiencing problems with taking a subsequence of nodes from a resource (stored?).

### What did you expect
> Describe what you expected to happen. Add for example a reference to a [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-3/).

No error, the text node of the second 'x' element with the code below.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
> Describe how we can can reproduce the problem.

> The *best* way is to provide a 'self containing' test, a test that can be run without dependancies. The [XQSuite - Annotation-based Test Framework for XQuery](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/xqsuite.xml) makes it very easy for you to create tests. These tests can be executed from the [eXide editor](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/eXide/index.html) (XQuery - Run as Test)

Running the following script:
```xquery
xquery version "3.1";

let $x := doc('/db/apps/test.xml')/test/x
let $xx := subsequence($x, 2, 1)
return $xx/text()
```

on the document (`/db/apps/text.xml`):
```xml
<test>
    <x>1</x>
    <x>2</x>
    <x>3</x>
</test>
```

creates the error:
```
exerr:ERROR Type error: the sub-sequence cannot be converted into a MemoryNodeSet. It contains nodes from stored resources.
```

With any build from source prior to ace6379f4d034fb1b5db61d1160f5a6c764d59af it returns:
```
2
```
