Each HttpClient request to an application creates  a new HtppSession, which will be never used after. We should have possibility to release a HttpSession after having request processed. for instance with adding some header to HttpClient and in XQueryServlet we have to invalidate session in case this header is provided. It will allow us to save some memory during backup/restore procedure, because each file needs a single separate request, which creates a session
