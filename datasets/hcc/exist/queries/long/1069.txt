As first discussed in https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/1065#issuecomment-232386003, something about the changes in https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/1016 (merged in on May 18) resulted in wrapper startup failures on macOS with builds of the develop branch since that day.  As a result, methods of startup which used to work - double-clicking on the macOS `.app` version of eXist (from a .dmg installer), double-clicking on `start.jar`, or using the command `open start.jar` - no longer work.

To confirm this, I downloaded two nightlies from Adam's site to see whether this change resulted in the problem we're seeing. Indeed, the .app from the .dmg nightly of May 17 starts right up, whereas the May 19th version doesn't start.

I also see a difference between the process of the May 17th (158eaa3) and May 19th (50d037f) versions. Here's how each appears when I start them via start.jar (opening its application package and double-click directly on its start.jar):

**May 17:**

**May 19:**

When I swap the May 17th version out and put the May 19th version in its place, the startup command from the May 17th process output successfully starts the May 19th version:
