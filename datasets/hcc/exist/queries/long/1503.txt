Resolution:
Code for buttons YES and NO in the Confirm deletion dialog should be exchanged, because when you press YES button in the Confirm deletion dialog, the contents are **not deleted**. The logic is inverse.

**Also**, close or cancel button in the same dialog should stop the backup procedure. But it acts as if I pressed YES button i.e. it proceeds with the backup and do not delete the contents.
