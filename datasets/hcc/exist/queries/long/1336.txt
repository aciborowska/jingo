This applies equally to:

1. `scm.branch` field in `$EXIST_HOME/version.txt`
2. `git-branch` property in `org/exist/system.properties` in builds.
3. `Build-Tag` attribute in `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` files of compiled jar and war files.

When building from a branch, the branch name is correctly recorded, e.g. after building from the `develop` branch the `version.txt` file looks like:

```
#eXist build info
project.version=3.2.0-SNAPSHOT
project.built=20170308153559
scm.branch=develop
scm.revision=f713fde
```

However, when building from a tag the branch name is recorded as `HEAD`, e.g. after building from the `eXist-3.1.0` tag the `version.txt` file looks like:

```
#eXist build info
project.version=3.1.0
project.built=20170308154049
scm.branch=HEAD
scm.revision=c679cd8
```

The `scm.branch` should likely instead be recorded as `tags/eXist-3.1.0`.
This is probably minor and we could fix it in a near future release.
