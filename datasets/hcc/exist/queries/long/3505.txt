**Describe the bug**

Guest users can create collections. The collections are “available” but completely hidden from dba users.

**Expected behavior**

Guest users should not be able to create collections. Created collections should always be visible to dba users.

**To Reproduce**

1. Log into the Java admin client as guest.
2. Create a collection “test” in “/db” (ensuring that this collection doesn’t already exist). You’ll get an error that guest cannot create a collection.
3. Submit a query, `xmldb:collection-available("/db/test")`, and the query will return `true()`.
4. Refresh the database listing, and there’s no “test” collection.
5. Even weirder, now log in as admin, and run the query, `xmldb:store("/db/test", "test.xml", <test/>)`. The query completes without error. Now refresh the directory contents, and notice that there’s still no "test" collection.
