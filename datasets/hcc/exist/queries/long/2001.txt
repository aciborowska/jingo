### What is the problem
- If you have a user name containing ```\``` and ```()``` like ```Omar\, Siam``` in an organisational unit like ```Austrian Center for digital humanities (ACDH)``` the LDAP code is unable to search for the corresponding groups because  for the search the DN is taken as is.

### What did you expect
* The ```\``` and ```()``` need to be escaped. ```\5c, \28, \29```.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
* Try the literal representation in Apache Directory Studio. Does not work.
