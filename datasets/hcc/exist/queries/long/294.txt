I have just installed RC2.2 and was copying our application code when I noticed that the db seems become unresponsive when saving certain module files. From the logs it appears that it is in some sort of an endless loop recompiling dependencies.

This is how it happened. I renamed the file that was already present, and copied it using oxygen from an instance running v2.1.
I had to forcibly kill exist, since no other way was available to stop it. When restarting, the file was not present. However, opening the original file, modifying it and saving it caused no error. Seems to be only when inserting the file anew. Using Oxygen 15.1 to do the insert.

When RestXq is enabled, this causes exist to hang in a repeating loop of trying to compile the dependent libraries. Note that in this case the libraries do not have the .xqm ending, but and .xql ending.

After disabling, restXq, the database did not hang, but Oxygen still reports an error when saving the file. However, it appears as if it has been saved correctly.

I created a small example with 2 libraries and a calling function, but could not replicate the problem. It seems that there need to be more libraries involved. The best would be to provide the full application to whoever needs to test it. You can request that for us, or we can give you access to the application from a remote location.
