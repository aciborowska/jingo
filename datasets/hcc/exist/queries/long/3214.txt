All but one folder in an exist distribution are named in the singular e.g. `autodeploy`, `bin`, `etc`,  and `lib`.

Unfortunately the folder for log files is named in the plural, i.e.: `logs`. It should have been named `log`, which would be inline with the LFS standard of names such as `/var/lib` and `/var/log`.

This is a breaking change, so needs to wait for a major release.
