One is unable to change the password of a user one has created in the Admin Client

On Mac OS 10.9.1, using Oracle build 1.7.0_51-b13, I have done the following:

1 download develop (8dc2e164dd)
2 build
2 start up eXist
3 open up admin client against new build
4 accept default settings (connect type: remote) and log in to admin account with the default empty password
5 choose Edit Users from Tools
6 set admin password to e.g. "secret"
7 create a user "foo" with password "bar" - assign "foo" to the group "guest" and click "Create"
9 open the user account for foo
10 change foo's password to e.g. "magic" and click "Save"
    # One gets the error "org.xmldb.api.base.XMLDBException: Wrong password for user [admin]"
11 restart the (now unresponding) admin client and log in with admin/secret
12 change the password of the foo user to the password of the admin user, "secret", and click "Save"
    # this works: the problem is that one can only change the password of existing users to the password of the admin user, since (I guess) the code for changing the admin user and changing other users is mixed up - when you change the admin user, a login with the new admin password is presumably performed, and this appears to be happening as well when you change the password of other users
