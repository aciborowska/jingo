Upon an authentication event, something like the following is output when in debug or trace mode:

Authenticated by 'exist' as '[auth] &lt;account name="guest" id="1048573"&gt;&lt;group name="guest" id="1048574"&gt;&lt;manager name="admin"/&gt;&lt;/group&gt;&lt;/user&gt;'.

This is not well-formed: &lt;/user&gt; should be &lt;/account&gt; (&lt;or <account&gt; should be &lt;user&gt;). I know it is not supposed to be read as XML, but it should at least look like XML.
