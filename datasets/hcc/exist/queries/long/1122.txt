You can't reverse proxy `/` to `/exist` any longer, as the dashboard will try and incorrectly redirect you to `/exist/apps/dashboard/index.html`. For example with this nginx config:

```
server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  play.evolvedbinary.com;

        charset utf8;

        proxy_set_header    Host                              $host;
        proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP                      $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For         $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-URI        $request_uri;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/exist/;
        }
}
```

When you visit `http://play.evolvedbinary.com/` the Dashboard attempts to redirect you to `http://play.evolvedbinary.com/exist/apps/dashboard/index.html`, however for the reverse proxy to work it should be `http://play.evolvedbinary.com/apps/dashboard/index.html`, it seems that the Dashboard incorrectly ignores the `X-Forwarded-URI` header
