### What is the problem
During a simple backup - restore (no database cleanup in between), some files haven't been restored due to errors reported by the XML parser:

```
Exception: ------------------------------------
Exception: ------------------------------------
Problems occured found during restore:

```

There is need a `--` in comments (issue 2), and all of the `repo.xml` files contain a root element with an attribute which name starts with an `#` character:

```xml
<repo:meta xmlns="http://exist-db.org/xquery/repo" 
    xmlns:repo="http://exist-db.org/xquery/repo" 
   #unknown="http://exist-db.org/xquery/repo">
    <repo:description>Shared resources used by other apps</repo:description>
    <repo:author>Wolfgang Meier</repo:author>
    <repo:website>https://github.com/eXist-db/shared-resources</repo:website>
    <repo:status>alpha</repo:status>
    <repo:license>GNU-LGPL</repo:license>
    <repo:copyright>true</repo:copyright>
    <repo:type>library</repo:type>
    <repo:target>shared-resources</repo:target>
    <repo:prepare/>
    <repo:finish/>
    <repo:permissions user="admin" group="dba" mode="0775"/>
```


### What did you expect
A restore should work flawlessly 

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
In the admin client, make a backup of a database (no special apps needed) and directly do restore from the backup.zip file.
