The installer fails with the following when setting the admin password:

```
The system cannot find the file C:\Localdata\Program.
"-Xms64m -Xmx768m -Djava.endorsed.dirs="C:\Localdata\eXist-db"\lib\endorsed"
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
-Djava.endorsed.dirs=C:\Localdata\eXist-db\lib\endorsed is not supported. Endorsed standards and standalone APIs
in modular form will be supported via the concept of upgradeable modules.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
```

further investigation is needed; Java9 is installed
