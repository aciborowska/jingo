### What is the problem
When deploying a WAR build of eXist-3.5.0, an error is thrown: 

> Unsigned application requesting unrestricted access to the system
> Unsigned resource: http://localhost:8888/exist-3.5.0/webstart/jcip-annotations-1.0.jar

I've verified the signatures of all 28 JAR files in the extracted WAR file's `WEB-INF\lib` folder that are listed in exist.jnlp,, and indeed only `WEB-INF\lib\jcip-annotations-1.0.jar` is the sole unsigned one. 

**YET**, I've noticed that the eXist source tree includes multiple copies of `jcip-annotations-1.0.jar`:

- `${exist_home}/lib/core/jcip-annotations-1.0.jar` (+- 5,5 Mb)
- `${exist_home}/extensions/contentextraction/lib/jcip-annotations-1.0.jar` (+- 2,2 Mb)
- `${exist_home}/extensions/betterform/main/lib/jcip-annotations-1.0.jar` (+- 2,2 Mb)

The one at `${exist_home}/lib/core/jcip-annotations-1.0.jar` is being signed by `jnlp-all`; the others aren't. Comparing with the version included in the WAR file, it is clearly one of the **unsigned** ones that ends up being copied there by the `dist-war` build target. 

One dirty workaround is replacing the extracted `WEB-INF\lib\jcip-annotations-1.0.jar` in the WAR tree with the signed `${exist_home}/lib/core/jcip-annotations-1.0.jar` from the eXist source tree.

On further inspection, I've noticed how the generated WAR file contains **all 3 versions** of `jcip-annotations-1.0.jar` in the `WEB-INF\lib` folder, so it makes sense that they eventually will overwrite each other when the WAR file is extracted.

Hence, IMO this rather seems an issue of incorrect file selection during the `dist-war` build task, unintendedly causing an unsigned JAR to be included in the WAR file, than a file signing issue.

### What did you expect
I'd expect the java admin client to start without problems.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
I've taken following steps, starting from a freshly installed eXist-3.5.0 version:

1. sign all jar files via `build jnlp-all`
2. build the WAR dist via `build dist-war`
3. deploy the WAR file in a Tomcat servlet container
4. start the Java web client via the dashboard
