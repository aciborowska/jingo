Try/catch clauses make some "magic variables" available in the catch block under the "err" namespace which the XQuery spec defines as "http://www.w3.org/2005/xqt-errors" (eg. $err:code, $err:description, etc).  However, eXist only understands these variables if the 'err' prefix is **unbound** in the query.

For example, this works as one would expect, returning 'just a test':

```
try {
  error(xs:QName('test'), 'just a test')
} catch * {
  $err:description
}
```

But simply adding the namespace definition for 'err' as below results in an XPDY0002 compile-time error:

```
declare namespace err="http://www.w3.org/2005/xqt-errors";
try {
  error(xs:QName('test'), 'just a test')
} catch * {
  $err:description
}
```

This is the exact **opposite** behaviour than expected by the spec, since it states that the 'err' namespace prefix is not predeclared.
