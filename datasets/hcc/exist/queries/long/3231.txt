I run the following XQuery script (I minimized it as much as possible). eXist eats my CPU up to 100%. I have to force shutdown the database.

```xquery
xquery version "3.1" encoding "UTF-8";

declare option exist:serialize "method=xml media-type=text/xml indent=yes";

<TEST>
{
  let $path as xs:string :='/db/TEST' 
  return
    <result>
      <collection name="{$path}" created="{xmldb:created($path)}" 
        owner-name="{sm:get-permissions(xs:anyURI($path))/sm:permission/@owner}"/>
    </result>       
}    
</TEST>
```

The cause is in the AVT for the `owner-name` attribute. But when I put that expression outside an AVT it simply works.

**Expected behavior**
The requested owner name in the attribute. Or: some error message about what I did wrong. But not a hangup

**To Reproduce**
Create a `/db/TEST` collection. Run the script above as admin.

**Context (please always complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows 10
 - eXist-db version: 5.2.0
 - Java Version 1.8.0_202-b08

**Additional context**
- How is eXist-db installed? jar
- Any custom changes in e.g. `conf.xml`? no
