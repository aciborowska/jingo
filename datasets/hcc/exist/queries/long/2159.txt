
### What is the problem`
The following XQuery gives an error message that as far as I understand things doesn't make sense:
```xquery
let $col as document-node()* := collection('/db/apps/dashboard')
let $doc as element()* := $col/xyz (: Resolves to an empty sequence :)
return 
  $doc/*[not(self::abc)]
  (: Results in: exerr:ERROR cannot convert xs:boolean('true') to a node set :)
```
### What did you expect
An empty sequence as output

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
Run the XQuery above
