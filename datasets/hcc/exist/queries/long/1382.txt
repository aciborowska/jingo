
### What is the problem
When installing a package, the repo system stores information in classpath.txt that contains absolut pathes from the filesystem. this makes it hard to move an instance from one location to another (same machine, or from local to server, when pathes are different).
see for example:
`webapp/WEB-INF/data/fs/db/apps/monex/.exist/classpath.txt`
`webapp/WEB-INF/data/expathrepo/monex-0.9.7/.exist/classpath.txt`

### What did you expect
I belive that i was able to move instances by copypasting or moving the folder in previous versions.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
start exist the first time with monex and a package that imports console in the autodeploy folder.
stop exist.
move the folder with for example `mv exist exist-moved`
start exist again
monex and console are not working and so the package with the dependency doesnt.

you can try it by calling `ant sade-dist-build` from https://gitlab.gwdg.de/fontane-notizbuecher/SADE.git develop branch
after the build task is completed 
`mv ./dist-build/antbuild/build/sade ./dist-build/antbuild/build/sade2
./dist-build/antbuild/build/sade2/bin/startup.sh`
