There seems to a technical synchronisation issue in `FileSyncThread`.

I can see several ways to fix, but I am not sure what @wolfgangmm's intention was exactly with regards to how that class should be used.

Basically [this call to `sync`](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/blob/develop/src/org/exist/storage/journal/FileSyncThread.java#L12), enables a write to the `syncTriggered` variable without sufficient synchronisation.
