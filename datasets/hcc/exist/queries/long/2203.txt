### What is the problem

The following code

```xquery
map { 'a': 1, 'a': 2 }
```

evaluates to

```xquery
map { 'a': 2 }
```

### What did you expect

An error should be raised, that key 'a' was entered twice.
BaseX does exactly that:

```
XQUERY map {'a':1, 'a':2}
Stopped at ., 1/5:
[XQDY0137] Key "a" already exists in map (values: 1 vs. 2).
```

This should not affect `map:put` or `map:merge` where this actually overwrites the given key in the returned, new map.
