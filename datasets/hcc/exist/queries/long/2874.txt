### What is the problem
When running restore of a backup file, in localmode, an "unexpected" location is used for the data directory.

### What did you expect
Use the data directory `EXIST_HOME/data` in stead of `EXIST_HOME/../data`

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
Run

```
bin\backup.bat -r full20190409-0300.zip -ouri=xmldb:exist:/// -R -q -P "password"
```

the data directory is actually written in the directory `exist-distribution\target\data` in stead of `exist-distribution\target\exist-distribution-5.0.0-RC8-SNAPSHOT-dir`

the current directory is `exist-distribution\target\exist-distribution-5.0.0-RC8-SNAPSHOT-dir`
