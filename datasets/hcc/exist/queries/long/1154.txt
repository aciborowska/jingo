When I tried to start exist with yajsw I got a bunch of errors and exist does not run although the wrapper script seems to start.

The directory `/tmp/vfs_cache` is needed by the wrapper. So I solved the Java error by creating it.

The errors caused by the missing libs in `tools/yajsw/lib/extended/` are not important but I installed the missing libs from the yajsw sources.

The next problem is (and still is) the `${env.EXIST_HOME}` environment variable. The system itself echoes the right path with `echo $EXIST_HOME` in any shell. Since I changed that with success the wrapper now does not try to make the folder with the name `${env.EXIST_HOME}` anymore but one with the name `?unresolved?` in the root of `$EXIST_HOME`.

exist is still not running after a successful installation with `./tools/yajsw/bin/installDaemon.sh`; `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` and `sudo systemctl start eXist-db`. systemctl starts the script and echoes success. Nor a direct call with `/etc/init.d/eXist-db start` leaves a running exist.

Starting `bin/startup.sh` in a screen session runs exist without any errors.
