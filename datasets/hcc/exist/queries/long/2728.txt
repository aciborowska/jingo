
### What is the problem

Create a document with the following contents:
```
<root>
    <!-- text <a> &lt;b&gt;  -->
</root>
```

Save it in exide or upload to db via webdav.

Reopen the document in exide or via webdav. The result will be:

```
<root>
    <!-- text <a> <b>  -->
</root>
```

### What did you expect
As far a I know, there is no need to escape anything inside XML comments, all characters are literal, the only restriction is the sequence '--' is not allowed. Therefore I expected the original contents of the document returned by existdb.
