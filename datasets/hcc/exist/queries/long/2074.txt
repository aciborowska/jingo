## What is the problem
- The templating system is used to provide the basic HTML for displaying the result of an XSL transformation:
```html
<html data-template="wdb:getEE">
    <head><title>test</title></head>
    <body>
        <div id="wdbContent" data-template="wdb:getContent" />
    </body>
</html>
```
- the function to apply the transformation is basically this:
```xquery
declare function wdb:getContent($node as node(), $model as map(*)) {
  let $re :=
    try { transform:transform(doc($file), doc($xslt), $params, $attr, "expand-xincludes=no") }
    catch * { <h1>Error</h1> }
	
  return 
    <div id="wdbContent">
        {$re}
    </div>
};
```
- this works fine if there are no errors in the XSLT. However, if there is an error, e.g. calling `doc()` on a file that does not exist, the output is an empty file:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html></html>
```
## What did you expect
The output of the given HTML in case of an error.

### additional observations:
1. calling `wdb:getContent` with exactly the same parameters from eXide produces the expected output in case of an error
1. everything else inside the `catch` is processed correctly – I tried to `console:log` before returning output, which worked, and forwarding handling to another function: there, too, `console:log` worked but no output was produced
1. using `transform:stream-transform` returns the expected output in case of an error (but of course won't work correctly with the templating system)

## Describe how to reproduce or add a test
The attached .zip contains an example. Store in `/db/apps` and call `$server/exist/apps/catch/view.html`.
If the line with `doc()` is commented out in the XSLT, you get “Testing”; if it is active, you get an empty response. If you use `stream-transform` instead of `transform` in app.xql, you get “error“ if the `doc()` line is active.
