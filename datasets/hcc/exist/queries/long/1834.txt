When building `HEAD` of the `develop` branch, AppVeyor does a git clone to `C:\projects\exist`.

However, it seems something has changed at AppVeyor where PRs (and probably other branches) and cloned to `C:\project\exist-xxxxx` where `xxxxx` is some sort if unique identifier.

Unfortunately for reasons unknown to me, eXist requires you to set an `EXIST_HOME` variable, for our AppVeyor build this is set to `C:\projects\exist` in our `appveyor.yml`. We have two options:

1. Quick fix. Modify `appveyor.xml` to use some sort of build environment variable set by AppVeyor (if available) for EXIST_HOME.
2. Remove our dependency on the environment variable `EXIST_HOME`. This should be possible as this requirement is pretty unique to eXist-db, there are many other projects, databases included, which don't need such a fixed path.
