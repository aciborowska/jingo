### What is the problem

eXist sometimes raises a type error when making a general comparison to an empty-sequence on the right-hand side (eg. `current-date() = ()`). It never raises this error if the empty sequence appears on the left-hand side (eg. `() = current-date()`).

This appears to be due to inconsistent practice in the implementation of the `compareTo(Collator, Comparison, AtomicValue)` method in each of the `org.exist.xquery.value` classes. Some explicitly check for `.isEmpty()` at the start, but `BooleanValue`, `AbstractDateTimeValue`, and `BinaryValue` do not (and there may be others that I missed).

### What did you expect

A general comparison to the empty sequence should always return `false()`, since no "[pair of atomic values](https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/#id-general-comparisons)" exists.
