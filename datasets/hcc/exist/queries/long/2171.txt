### What is the problem

Starting eXist-db.app with Java 11 on macOS yields the following error:

> This application requires that Java 8 or later be installed on your computer. Please download and install the latest version of Java from www.java.com and try again.

This problem is analogous to https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/issues/1792 and is caused by a version string parsing bug in the "appbundler" tool used to create eXist-db.app, https://bitbucket.org/infinitekind/appbundler.

### What did you expect

I expected eXist-db.app to start with any version of Java 8 or higher.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test

1. Install Java 11. Uninstalling other versions of Java may be necessary to prevent earlier versions from being the system default. Opening a new Terminal window and running `java -version` should report Java 11.
2. Download eXist-db-4.4.0 DMG installer, open the DMG, and drag eXist-db.app into the Applications folder. 
3. Start eXist-db.app

Alternative route: `brew cask install java exist-db` and start /Applications/eXist-db.app.
