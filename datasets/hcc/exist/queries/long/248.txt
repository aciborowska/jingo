As shown by Gerrit (http://markmail.org/thread/ecossedrufb5yamp) whether or not indexing is applied influences the outcome of a query like,

```
let $query :=
<query>
    <near slop="20"><term>love</term><near>father</near></near>
</query>
return //SPEECH[ft:query(., $query)][contains(../TITLE,' ')][../STAGEDIR='Exit']
```

With indexing of both TITLE and STAGEDIR, it results in 0 items; without indexing or with an index on just one of these, it results in 2 items.

Curiously, if one supplies a dummy attribute to one or both of the indexed elements (*:TITLE or *:STAGEDIR), one obtains the expected results.

Tested with current develop.
