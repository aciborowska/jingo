Suppose there is a trigger on collection A set by a collection.xconf. Adding a file to collection A triggers an XQuery which reads the file and creates new files Q1; Q2; etc. in collection B. The XQuery uses the xmldb:store function to create these files.

As collection B is a sibling from collection A, there is a different collection.xconf on B. This one sets a after-document-create event which should execute an XQuery.

The issue is that the trigger on collection B **only** works when I manually add a file to collection B. This trigger does not respond to trigger A writing an XML file with xmldb:store into collection B. I think it should not matter whether the file was created through webdav or through xmldb:store.
