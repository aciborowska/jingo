### What is the problem
I am embedding eXist, and I am turning off recovery by setting `/exist/db-connection/recovery/@enabled` to `false` in `conf.xml`.
This leads to a `java.util.NoSuchElementException: No value present` in `BrokerPool`.

### What did you expect
I expected to be able to create a local connection.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
I will ad a pull request shortly, with a [BrokerPoolNoRecoveryTest](https://github.com/ohumbel/exist/blob/a0c74f30570b4668ec00fbbb7781adaaeddf07de/exist-core/src/test/java/org/exist/storage/BrokerPoolNoRecoveryTest.java) reproducing the problem.

### Context information
I tested it on branches `develop` and `develop-4.x.x`. The problem is present on both.
My Java version is `Java8u202`.
It is happening on Windows, Linux and Mac, 64 bit.
I embedded `exist-core`, `exist-optional` and `exist-start` into my application.
I set `/exist/db-connection/recovery/@enabled` to `false` in `conf.xml`.
