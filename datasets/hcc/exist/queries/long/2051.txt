### What is the problem
> whereas an XPath expression like
`preceding-sibling::a`
works as it should, more general expressions involving the sibling axes are _extremely_ inefficient.
`preceding-sibling::*
preceding-sibling::node()
preceding-sibling::text()
`
do seem to work, but take ages to evaluate both as steps in an XPath and as filter expressions. The same goes for following-sibling.

### What did you expect
> fast execution

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
> On a collection containing just a few thousand elements `<a>`, run a query like
`$coll//a[following-sibling::*]`
sit back and relax (for 10-30 minutes!!!)

I would also like to add that these queries cannot be killed, or more precisely, killing them takes just as long as running them.
