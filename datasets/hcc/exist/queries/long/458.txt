I need to write out some json to the file system from an xml doc.  So, I tried the following:

``` xquery
file:serialize(<root><item>thing</item></root>, "/path/to/data.json", ("method=json","media-type=application/json"))
```

In data.json the node is duplicated as such:

``` javascript
{ "item" : "thing" } { "item" : "thing" }
```

My system info:
