`err:XQST0054` is an XQuery 1.0 static error that is raised when the initializing expression of a variable "depends on" itself through a circular reference. This error does not exist in XQuery 3.0 and should never be raised for version 3 scripts.

eXist is inappropriately raising this error in some scripts that make use of named function references. For example, this query does not compile:
```xquery
xquery version "3.0";
declare variable $var := map { 'a':local:fun#1, 'b':0 };
declare function local:fun($a) { $var?b = $a };
local:fun(1)
```

According to version 3 semantics, this is a valid script which should return `false()`.

There is no circular dependancy in this example since `$var` does not "depend on" `local:fun`. Named function references did not exist In XQuery 1.0, and so the [definition of "depends"](https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/#dt-variable-depends) did not take them into account and its use of the word "reference" may be confusing in this regard. In XQuery 3, the [definition of "depends on"](https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/#dt-depends-on) has been reworked to properly account for higher-order functions and raises a different error if problems are encountered (`err:XQDY0054`). Notably, named function references do not "access" any variables and so can never cause cycles.
