The following XQuery should work, but instead causes a `ClassCastException` in the `XQueryTreeParser`:
```xquery
let $as-uri := xs:anyURI(?)
return
	$as-uri("/db")
```


The work around for now is to use:
```xquery
let $as-uri := function($path) { xs:anyURI($path) }
return
	$as-uri("/db")
```
