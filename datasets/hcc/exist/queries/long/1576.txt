### What is the problem

While the installer of version 3.4.1 created the folder that was given as argument for the 'Data Directory', the one of 3.5.0 doesn't. This is at least true for relative paths that are supposed to be siblings of the installation target.

If this changed behaviour is intended, it should be mentioned in the changelog.
