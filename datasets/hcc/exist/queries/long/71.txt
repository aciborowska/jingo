When an imported xquery module declares 'xquery' as its namespace prefix, eXist-2.1 throws an error.  A test case can be found at https://gist.github.com/rvdb/7152363. If ns_main.xq is executed with eXist (eXide / Java client / controller), following error is thrown:

```
Cannot compile xquery: exerr:ERROR error found while loading module test: 
Error while loading module ns_module.xq: error found while loading module 
from ns_module.xq: org.exist.xquery.XPathException: err:XPST0003 expecting
name, found 'xquery' [at line 2, column 18]
```

This seems incorrect: 'xquery' is not listed as reserved namespace prefix in the spec (http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/#id-basics), which is confirmed by the fact that Saxon does execute ns_main.xq without problems.

Additionally, this problem seems limited to module namespace declarations. Another test case at https://gist.github.com/rvdb/7152340 is executed without errors, which demonstrates that 'xquery' _can_ be used in a main module without complaints.
