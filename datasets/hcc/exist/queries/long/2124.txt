### What is the problem

Start with a Lucene index on a field named "date" created with ft:index.  Either of the following two query strings, when passed to ft:search, returns the correct results:

```xquery
 let $query := "date:1600"
 let $query := "date:1610"
```

but when I turn that into an inclusive range, like so:

```xquery
let $query := "date:[1600 TO 1610]"
```

nothing is returned.  There is no syntax error -- it just silently fails. Specifying a range query using an XML query description also does not work, but at least such a query is rejected rather than being silently ignored.

The only workaround I've come up with is to manually expand the range into a set like so:

```xquery
 let $query := "date:(1601 1602 1603 1604 1605 1606 1607 1608 1609 1610)"
```

That does work, at least for integer values, but has serious limitations for a range over more than a few elements.

### What did you expect

I expect range specifications to work in Lucene queries.  Range specifications are a documented part of the Lucene query syntax and  the eXist docs [here](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/lucene.xml) simply point to the authoritative Lucene syntax documentation [here](https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_10_4/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#package_description) without specifying that only a subset is implemented in eXist.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test

See above.  Also inspect the Lucene query implementation [here](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/blob/develop/extensions/indexes/lucene/src/org/exist/indexing/lucene/XMLToQuery.java#L59%3E) and note that "range" is not one of the keywords recognized.  That is where the Lucene XML query syntax is parsed.  I was not able to pinpoint where the ordinary Lucene syntax is parsed.

Personally I'm more interested in the ordinary syntax (a:[B TO C]) but for completeness it seems the XML query syntax should also support it.  What [ElasticSearch does with JSON](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/query-dsl-range-query.html) should translate pretty naturally into eXist's XML Lucene query specifications.

### Context information

Not platform-specific.  Currently still not implemented in eXist 4.3.1.
