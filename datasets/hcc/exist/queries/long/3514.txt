**Describe the bug**

Testing for negative durations can be achieved by testing if the duration is smaller than a zero second duration.
The following queries returns false() in existdb 5.3.0-SNAPSHOT:

```xquery
xs:dayTimeDuration("-PT0.1S") < xs:dayTimeDuration("PT0S"),
xs:dayTimeDuration("-PT0.1S") < xs:dayTimeDuration("PT0.1S")
```

These tests however work as expected:

```xquery
xs:dayTimeDuration("-PT0.1S") < xs:dayTimeDuration("PT1S"),
xs:dayTimeDuration("-PT1S") < xs:dayTimeDuration("PT0S")
```


**Expected behavior**

The above query to return `true()`.
Saxon 10HE does return `true()`.

**To Reproduce**

```Xquery
xquery version "3.1";

module namespace t="http://exist-db.org/xquery/test";

declare namespace test="http://exist-db.org/xquery/xqsuite";

declare
    %test:assertTrue
function t:test() {
    xs:dayTimeDuration("-PT0.1S") < xs:dayTimeDuration("PT0S")
};
```
