As per http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/indexing.xml

> You can only have one .xconf file at each level.

Phrasing here suggest this is strict rule, not a guideline, yet no checks are in place or warnings raised when multiple .xconf files are present in a collection. 

It is unclear if multiple .xconfs are merged and acted upon or some arbitrary one is chosen?
