The following (legal, according to my and Saxon's understanding) XQuery expressions fails to parse in eXist-db-2.2RC2:

```
<root a="{'a'}"/>
```

The error is: err:XPST0003 unexpected token: ' (while expecting closing tag for element constructor: root)

Other literals do no cause this problem; for instance `<root a="{1}"/>` works without problems.
