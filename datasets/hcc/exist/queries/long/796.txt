When a path expression contains a step that evaluates to an empty sequence, subsequent path steps are nevertheless still evaluated. This works fine when subsequent path steps are `AxisStep`s (since the context is empty), but strange things happen when subsequent steps are `PostfixExpr`.

For example, eXist evaluates `()/true()` as `true()` instead of empty.

Notably, `() ! true()` evaluates to the empty sequence as I would expect.
