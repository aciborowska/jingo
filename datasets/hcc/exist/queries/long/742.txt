According to the XQuery 3 spec, the catch clause in a try/catch expression should support any NameTest, including `*:name`, and `ns:*` wildcard forms.  However, only NCName's, QName's, and " \* " are currently supported by eXist.  eXide reports an "<AST>:0:0: Unexpected AST node" error for other wildcard types.

PS: URIQualifiedName's aren't supported either, but they seem to be generally unsupported in eXist, not just in try/catch.
