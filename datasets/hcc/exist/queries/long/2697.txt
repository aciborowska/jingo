### What is the problem
> on my data set containing ~250000 `<eg>` elements, which occur in groups of ~1-10
execution time of `eg[preceding-sibling::eg]` is 0.892 s. (194992 results), while execution time of `eg[following-sibling::eg]` is 71.441 s. (!!!) (same number of results)  

### What did you expect
> I may be completely wrong, but I would have thought that following-sibling and preceding-sibling axes might be implemented very similarly, so execution times should also be similar. The execution time for preceding-sibling seems reasonable, following-sibling on the other hand seems to suffer from major performance problems.

Sibling axes in general perform rather erratically ( #2129, #2051 ), but this difference seems quite inexplicable at first glance, and comparing the source code for preceding-sibling an following-sibling might reveal something useful. I hope following-sibling can be quickly fixed to behave like preceding-sibling, right now its seems to be bugged.

### Test
```
xquery version "3.1";

let $testdoc := <test>{(1 to 5000)!<a>{(1 to 20)!<b>{.}</b>}</a>}</test>
let $coll := xmldb:create-collection('/db','testaxes')
let $store := xmldb:store("/db/testaxes", "testaxes.xml", $testdoc)

let $t1_0 := util:system-time()
let $test1 := doc($store)//b[preceding-sibling::b]
let $t1_1 := util:system-time()
let $exec1 := ($t1_1 - $t1_0) div xs:dayTimeDuration("PT1S")

let $t2_0 := util:system-time()
let $test2 := doc($store)//b[following-sibling::b]
let $t2_1 := util:system-time()
let $exec2 := ($t2_1 - $t2_0) div xs:dayTimeDuration("PT1S")

return 
    <testresults>
        <test id="1" count="{count($test1)}" time="{$exec1} s."/>
        <test id="2" count="{count($test2)}" time="{$exec2} s."/>
    </testresults>
```
   
my results: 

```
<testresults>
    <test id="1" count="95000" time="0.545 s."/>
    <test id="2" count="95000" time="72.895 s."/>
</testresults>
```
if the sibling axes are used as steps in the XPath expression (rather than filter clauses), I get similar results.
