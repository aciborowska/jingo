BrokerPool uses this field without sync

```
public DBBroker get(final Subject user) throws EXistException {
...
DBBroker broker = activeBrokers.get(Thread.currentThread());
if(broker != null) {
            //increase its number of uses
            broker.incReferenceCount();
...
}
...
```

I suggest to replace field **referenceCount** from **int** to **AtomicInteger**
