This issue may be related to https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/issues/2159 (where I first posted about it). I'm seeing a buggy error in which eXist seems to be misreading and XPath node sequence as xs:boolean, with this error: "Type error: the sequence cannot be converted into a node set. Item type is xs:boolean." This seems to be a misreading of a certain kind of syntax, which I'll document here. 

### Context:
 I generate the same error when running a query in eXist-dB 4.2.1 and in eXist 5.2.  I don't see the error when running the same query in oXygen version 22 with Saxon-HE XQuery 9.9.1.5. 

### Test File and Query to generate the error
Here is a simple XML test file and a query to generate the error.

1) Here's [a simple XML file](https://github.com/robftg/Rocket-Launches/blob/master/XMLandRNG/sts135.xml) for the query (from my students, with marked data about dates and times of rocket launches): This contains a couple of elements with attribute nodes holding date-time data.

2) Here's an XQuery script to try (change the `doc()` function to wherever you're storing the test file.). 
```
xquery version "3.1";
let $testDoc := doc('/db/testQuery/sts135.xml')
let $launchAndLand := $testDoc//*[@*[name() ! contains(., 'DateTime')]]
return $launchAndLand
```

The error message generated in eXist-db is: 
**exerr:ERROR: Type error: the sequence cannot be converted into a node set. Item type is xs:boolean**
