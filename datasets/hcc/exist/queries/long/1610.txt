### What is the problem
When deploying an app during autodeploy (first start of the db with *.xar at ./autodeploy) the usage of `sm:passwd#2` in `pre-install.xql` or `post-install.xql` throws an error and stops execution of the script.

### What did you expect
The usage of sm:passwd#2 should work as expected during autodeploy.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
```bash
git clone git@github.com:eXist-db/exist.git /tmp/eXist-test
cd /tmp/eXist-test
git checkout eXist-3.5.0
# but it fails on recent as well, i guess
./build.sh
unzip autodeploy/dashboard-0.4.7.xar pre-install.xql
# will cancel the pre-install script and stop the deployment
echo ', sm:passwd("admin", "somepass")' >> pre-install.xql
zip autodeploy/dashboard-0.4.7.xar pre-install.xql
# just a little clean up here:
rm pre-install.xql
./bin/startup.sh
```
If you like to try it on a post-install script (the app will be deployed) you can modify the monex application like this:
```bash
# wipe the data at first
rm -rf webapp/WEB-INF/{data/*,logs/*.log}
unzip autodeploy/monex-0.9.10.xar post-install.xql
# insert on line 10, everything below will not be executed
sed -i '10i\let $test := sm:passwd("admin", "somepass")' post-install.xql
zip autodeploy/monex-0.9.10.xar post-install.xql
rm post-install.xql
./bin/startup.sh
```
So the trick is to set `sm:passwd#2` as last function call in post-install.xql, so the app will be deployed, the password will be set, but the error is still reported in the logfile `expath-repo.log`:
```log
	at org.exist.security.internal.SecurityManagerImpl.updateAccount(SecurityManagerImpl.java:239) ~[exist.jar:3.5.0]
```
