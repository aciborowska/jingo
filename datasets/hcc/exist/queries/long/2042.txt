This commit: https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/commit/7e6b2691012cfccb76fd772c0aacfa5d55eaa505#diff-1a7f6e1a39c50b3b42adcf60d6dfc6bd 

changed the behavior for how global variables are reset in eXist. The issue is that multiple instances of modules are instantiated as part of normal system operation. However some modules are still in use when others are reset, this causes the global variables to be nullified across all instances of the module prematurely causing queries that rely on these to fail.

It seems that in order to prevent this from happening globalVariables must either not be static or more logic must be implemented to ensure that reset is not called while modules are still referenced or in use.
