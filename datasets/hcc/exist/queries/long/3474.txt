**Describe the bug**

In eXist, errors involving functions inside element constructors like `element foo { map { "x": "y" } }` lack location information.

**Expected behavior**

I expected the errors to report the location of the error in the query, as they do in BaseX and Saxon. (Saxon has the best error description of the 3 in this case.)

**To Reproduce**

```xquery
xquery version "3.1";

element foo { map { "x": "y" } }
```

eXist error:

> err:XQTY0105 Enclosed expression contains function item

BaseX returns the error at the start of the enclosed content:

> Stopped at /Users/joe/Downloads/file, 3/13:
> 
> [XQTY0105] Invalid content: map { "x": "y" }.

Saxon reports the error as appearing at the first character of the map constructor, with a very clear error description (if missing the error code):

> Cannot add a map as a child of a constructed element
> 
> Start location: 3:16
