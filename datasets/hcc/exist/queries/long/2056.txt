### What is the problem
When importing / saving static HTML5 files (e.g. via the collection browser or oXygen) the doctype gets removed. When editing those files in eXide the doctype is not present and also cannot be included manually (inserting and saving has no effect). Serving those files to the browser results in an XML-prologue being inserted instead. When exporting the files the former HTML5 doctype is also not present anymore.

Interesstingly, when generating and saving static HTML5 files via the serialize() function and xmldb:store() everything works as expected.

### What did you expect
eXist should not change imported static HTML5 files and always keep the HTML5 doctype

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
Import any valid static HTML5 file in eXist with the collection browser and open it in eXide.
