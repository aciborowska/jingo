The following query, incorrectly raises `XPDY0002` - `Context sequence is empty and no argument specified`

```xquery
()/fn:base-uri()
```

The XQuery 3.1 F+O spec states:

```
The zero-argument version of the function returns the base URI of the context node: it is equivalent to calling fn:base-uri(.).

The single-argument version of the function behaves as follows:

1. If $arg is the empty sequence, the function returns the empty sequence.
2. Otherwise, the function returns the value of the dm:base-uri accessor applied to the node $arg. This accessor is defined, for each kind of node, in the XDM specification (See Section 5.2 base-uri Accessor DM31).
```

In this instance clause (1) should apply.
