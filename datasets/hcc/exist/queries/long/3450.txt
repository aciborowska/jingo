**Describe the bug**

I have discovered several cases in which eXist fails to include the location of errors in queries.

**Expected behavior**

When reporting errors, eXist should always report the line number and position (or column and row) of errors.

For a clue about what might be needed to fix this, see several similar fixes: https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/search?q=error+location&unscoped_q=error+location&type=Commits.

**To Reproduce**

The error messages raised by the conditions in the conditional expressions below fail to include the location of the error.

```xquery
if (map { "foo": "bar" } eq 1) then "yay" else "boo"
```

The error raised:

> err:FOTY0013 A function item other than an array cannot be atomized

Similarly:

```xquery
if ("a" eq 1) then "yay" else "boo"
```

The error raised: 

> err:XPTY0004 can not compare xs:string('a') with xs:integer('1')

I would expect the error message to include the location of the error—the condition.

Saxon reports the error at line 3 column 6 (one character to the right of the open parens of the condition). BaseX reports the error at line 3 column 30 (or 13 in the 2nd query)—(the close parens of the condition). eXist should be able to report column and line numbers of errors like this and others that it raises.
