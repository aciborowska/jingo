I stumbled across the following bug while I was trying to setup indexing:

I have an easy Xquery:

``` xquery
xquery version "3.0";
declare default element namespace 'http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim';
<collection>{subsequence((
   doc("/db/od/books_export.xml")/collection/record[datafield/subfield/text() = 'algebraic']
),0,2)}
</collection>
```

This query returns one matching result.

If I add the following file as "/db/system/config/db/od/collection.xconf" (without reindexing the database!), the above Xquery returns an empty set of results.

``` xml
<collection xmlns="http://exist-db.org/collection-config/1.0">
    <index xmlns:marc="http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim">
        <!-- Range indexes -->
        <range>
            <create qname="marc:subfield" type="xs:string"/>
        </range>
    </index>
</collection>
```

~~It seems that eXistDb tries to use the range index although it was not created so far. To me this is very confusing and this behaviour should be changed or at least documented.~~
