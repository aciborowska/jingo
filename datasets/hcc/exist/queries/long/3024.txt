As reported to me by Vincent Lizzi... When restoring a very large backup using XML-RPC remote API, there can be a very long pause before any progress at all is reported. It appears to the user that either nothing is happening or the system has crashed.

* When restoring a backup, we first create a Zip which we then copy up to the server before initiating the restore process. The creation of this zip and copying it to the server needs to be included in the restore progress feedback.
