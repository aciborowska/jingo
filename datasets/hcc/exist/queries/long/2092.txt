### What is the problem

The following expressions (which should be interpreted and evaluated identically as far as I know),

```xquery
$coll//a[contains(., 'str')] => count()
```
and
```xquery
count( $coll//a[contains(., 'str')] )
```
... may, in fact, return different values.

After some investigation I concluded that the difference is due to the fact that element 'a' has a case-insensitive range index defined on it, and the first expression containing the arrow operator fails to use the index, hence the different results.

Similar expressions with a `matches(., 'str')` filter clause always give identical values.

### What did you expect

I expected the two expressions to be evaluated in exactly the same way
