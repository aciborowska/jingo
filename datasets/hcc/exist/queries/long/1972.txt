The following very simple query from the XQTS 3.1 will result in a `java.lang.StackOverflowError`.

```xquery
3 treat as item()+ + +1
```

It should also be considered as a security issue. This simple query could be sent to the REST end-point of any eXist-db server (which exposes the service), and it will cause the JVM to shutdown.

The XQTS states that we can should return the value `4`, or any error code. So we can decide what we want to do here.
