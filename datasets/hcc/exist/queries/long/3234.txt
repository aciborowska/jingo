**Describe the bug**
Documentation of binary-compatible upgrade at <http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/upgrading> could be improved. Tested by upgrading from 5.0 to 5.1.1 on MacOS using dmg installer.

The documentation advises removing the empty new *data* directory and copying the old one in its place. It also says that the default location of the *data* directory is *$EXIST_HOME/data*. On my system *$EXIST_HOME* is not set and eXist-db installed itself into */Applications*, while the data installed itself into */Users/my_user_id/Library/Application Support/org.exist* (without the directory name *data*, that is, there is no directory called *data*). 

**The new installation defaulted to use that same location for data, so there was no empty directory to delete and nothing to copy.**
