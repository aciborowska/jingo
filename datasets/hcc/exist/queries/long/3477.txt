
**Describe the bug**
In eXist 5.2.0, the following date is recognized as valid: `xs:date("-0004-02-29")`. However, since year 0 does not exist and -0001 (1BC) is directly followed by 0001 (1AD), leap years in the BC era should be off by 1 and therefore odd numbers (-1, -5, -9, -13...).

**Expected behavior**
 `xs:date("-0005-02-29")` should be a valid date.

**To Reproduce**
```Xquery
xquery version "3.1";

let $date := xs:date("-0005-02-29")

return $date

```
