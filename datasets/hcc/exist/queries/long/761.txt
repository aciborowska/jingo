Hi,

With eXist 3.0, sm:get-group-managers() does not return all the group managers. If I am looking into the group file itself, and set the group managers with sm:add-group-manager(), the function sm:get-group-managers() returns correctly the group managers. Although, the correct result does not persist if I restart eXist.
