**Describe the bug**

When performing a field-based full text query, ft:facet returns incorrect results if the element name queried with ft:query is surrounded with parentheses. 

Here's a common use case that requires the use of parentheses: let's say we want to search the "title" field of our TEI *and* DocBook documents for the term "china", and return information on the "year-published" facet results. We should be able to do this, by querying both TEI and DocBook documents at once:

```xquery
collection("/db/data")/(tei:TEI|dbk:article)[ft:query(., "title:china")] 
=> ft:facets(map {"facets": "year-published"})
```

However, as the test query below shows, the use of parentheses around the element name—even a single name—causes ft:facets to return incorrect results.

**Expected behavior**

I expected ft:facet to produce correct results, despite the presence of parentheses in the ft:query expression that produces the hits.

**To Reproduce**

In the following xqsuite test, based on https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/blob/develop/extensions/indexes/lucene/src/test/xquery/lucene/facets.xql#L418-L429, the only change is that I have replaced `div` with `(div)`:

```xquery
declare
    %test:assertEquals(1)
function facet:query-no-default-index-but-facet() {
    let $result := doc("/db/lucenetest/multi-lang.xml")//(div)[ft:query(., "english:*", map { "leading-wildcard": "yes" })]
    return
        ft:facets($result, "language")?en
};
```

Instead of returning the expected result, 1, this version of the query returns 11:

```xml
<testcase name="query-no-default-index-but-facet" class="facet:query-no-default-index-but-facet">
    <failure message="assertEquals failed." type="failure-error-code-1">1</failure>
    <output>11</output>
</testcase>
```
