My XQuery script performs a call to `unparsed-text()` and asks for a file *in* the database that has world read permissions. E.g. 

```
unparsed-text('/db/apps/eXide/build.js')
```

What I get is: `err:FOUT1170 non-dba user not allowed to read from file system`

(Anyway, why is the error code something with FOUT, the Dutch word for error...)

**Expected behavior**
The unparsed text of the requested file 

**To Reproduce**
* run eXide as guest user. 
* Enter ` unparsed-text('/db/apps/eXide/build.js')`  as XQuery script
* Run it: error
* Login as amin
* Run it again: Ok
