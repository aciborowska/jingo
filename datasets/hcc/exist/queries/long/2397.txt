As reported by @raducoravu  in https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/issues/2311#issuecomment-455116030:

The JNLP file is pointing to non existing JAR files:

```
exist/webstart/pkg-java-fork.jar  --> missing version nr
exist/webstart/j8fu-1.16.jar --> probably double digit is a problem
exist/webstart/gnu-crypto-2.0.1.jar --> replaced
exist/webstart/xmldb.jar -> renamed and has version nr
```
