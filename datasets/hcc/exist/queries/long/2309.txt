### What is the problem

Install an app **A** in version *x* and modify some data.

Now update **A** to a new version *y*.

In order to be able to backup or migrate the data in the running instance of A the installation process has to have a hook where:

- The application versions of the current and the new one are known.
- No data was deleted.
- a script is run when defined in `repo.xml`

### What did you expect

I expected that the `<setup/>` hook would provide this. But it seems that the current data is removed too early.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test

see above
