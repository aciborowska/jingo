### What is the problem
If you create an XQuery module yourself with XQdoc comments, in some cases you see old information which does not go away on a regenerate. 

### What did you expect
Consistent information displayed by the fundocs app

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test

- Add a module with XQdoc in it to the database (anywhere). Here is an example: [testmod.zip](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/files/2456315/testmod.zip)
- Go to fundocs (as admin) and regenerate. 
- Search for "blah". The new module and  function should show up.
- Click on the namespace (http://www.xatapult.com/ns/testmod) in the grey-background header. You get the module's information.
- Now change something in the XQdoc of the module and save
- Regenerate the fundocs
- Re-search on "blah". You should see the applied changes to the XQdoc
- Click on the namespace again. The information there is old, it shows the previous XQdoc version.
