### What is the problem
When I try to install exist-db 5.0 using the [jar installer][jar installer], it seems to install, but the launcher will not work. I've tried clicking the eXist-db Database shortcut in the Start Menu,

and I've tried running the `launcher.bat` file it points to on the command line, but the splash screen doesn't appear—or if it does, it's so fast that I never see it—and the server doesn't start.


[jar installer]: https://bintray.com/existdb/releases/exist/5.0.0/view


### What did you expect
#### Expectation
Splash Screen to appear, server to start, and then bottom corner icon to be visible
#### Reality
Unfortunately no Splash Screen, no start of server, no bottom corner icon

However, if I run `bin/startup.bat`, the server seems to start up and will show me eXide if I go to `http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/eXide/index.html`.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
Run jar installer with all default values.
Run launcher.bat either via the command line or Startup shortcut
