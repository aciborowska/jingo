A login box is presented when I try to PUT content but I'm already logged in. The PUT request was forwarded to REST from the controller via this entry:

``` xml
<dispatch xmlns="http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist">
    <forward url="{$exist:resource}">
      {$login("org.exist.login", "/", (), false())}
    </forward>
</dispatch>
```
