Hi, 

seems like fn.tokenize is  default case-insensitive for characters in the pattern and behaves as if the i-flag was specified.

try:
tokenize('firstSecondThirdLast', '[A-Z]')

Should split on the capital letters only, but splits on every character.
The error is found in the latest release, but also found in an earlier release I have tried.

Regards,
Trond
