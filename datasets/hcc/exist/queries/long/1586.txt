### What is the problem
when building eXist with the target "dist" (to place an executable version of the software in a single directory without the sources) the resulting software comes without a complete betterform integration, the initial observation is that the dashboard is not available (the browser reports 404 when requesting dojo.js from bfResources)

it seems that the `web.xml` misses the corresponding servlets configuration which get added by the build target `patchWebXml` from `extensions/betterform/build.xml`.

(if we manually call this task after the build is complete, we can correct this problem, thanks to @Lena-Luise who found this solution)

### What did you expect
a working instance of the database with a working dashboard - obviously.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
```bash
./build.sh dist
./dist/eXist*/bin/startup.sh
curl http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/bfResources/scripts/dojo/dojo.js
```
