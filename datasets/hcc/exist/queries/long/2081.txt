### What is the problem
Saving HTML files to the database (tested with webdav, eXide and notices on deploying a .xar)  eXist serializes brackets, even those inside CDATA sections. So `>` becomes` &gt;`

### What did you expect
This does not happen in the 3.x.x branch, the brackets inside CDATA sections are preserved. This is important for the JavaScript sections embedded in HTML.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
Save the below into eXide as html:

```
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <h1>Test CDATA</h1>
    <p>Error: When this file is saved to the database (tested with webdav, eXide and notices on deploying a .xar) 
        eXist serializes brackets (> becomes &gt;), even those inside CDATA sections.</p>
    <p>eXist 4.0.0 seems to be okay, error exists in 4.2.0, 4.3.0, 4.3.1 and eXist-5.0.0-RC2</p>
    <script type="text/javascript"><![CDATA[  > Test < ]]></script>
</div>

```
