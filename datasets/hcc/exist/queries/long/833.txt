It looks like exist:matches are missing from Lucene proximity searches that use standard search syntax. 

The following feeds pairs of queries that should be equivalent, the first of a pair using standard syntax and the second XML syntax:

```
xquery version "3.0";

declare namespace tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0";

let $collection := collection('/db/apps/shakespeare/data')
let $queries := (
    '"thee nunnery"~2'
    ,
    <query>
      <near slop="2">
        <term>thee</term>
        <term>nunnery</term>
      </near>
    </query>
    ,
    '"double bubble"~7'
    ,
    <query>
      <near slop="7">
        <term>double</term>
        <term>bubble</term>
      </near>
    </query>
    ,
    '"fair foul"~2'
    ,
    <query>
      <near slop="2">
        <term>fair</term>
        <term>foul</term>
      </near>
    </query>
    ,
    '"fenny snake"~1'
    ,
    <query>
      <near slop="1">
        <term>fenny</term>
        <term>snake</term>
      </near>
    </query>
)
return
<results>{
    for $query at $i in $queries
    let $hits := $collection//tei:sp[ft:query(., $query)]
    let $hit-count := count($hits)
    let $hits := util:expand($hits)
    let $match-count := count($hits//exist:match)
    return
        <result n="{$i}">
            <query-expression>{$query}</query-expression>
            <hit-count>{$hit-count}</hit-count>
            <match-count>{$match-count}</match-count>
        </result>
}</results>
```

The first three queries using standard syntax have hits, but no exist:matches, which shouldn’t be possible. The corresponding queries using XML syntax have both hits and exist:matches.

The (stored) hit output shows no marking of matches, i.e. it not a case of faulty marking.

'"fenny snake”~1 is also a proximity search, but the occurrence of exist:matches here must be because the two words are contiguous. Still, the match-count is different from the query using XML syntax. I don't know what this shows about what goes wrong - I thought phrase searches were internally converted to proximity searches with 0 slop, but that does not seem to be the case.

With results 5 and 6 the hit-count is also not the same.
