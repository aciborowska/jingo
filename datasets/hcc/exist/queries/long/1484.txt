### What is the problem

The function documentation for `xmldb:clear-lock()` appears to be a copy of `xmldb:document-has-lock()`. See https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/blob/develop/src/org/exist/xquery/functions/xmldb/XMLDBHasLock.java#L63-L74.

### What did you expect

The description should describe what the function actually does. Probably something like:

> Clears a write lock on the resource `$resource` in the collection `$collection-uri`. 

I'm not sure what the return value is supposed to be, but I think the current value must be wrong:

> the user id of the lock owner, otherwise if not locked the empty sequence

Perhaps it should be:

> `true()` if a lock was successfully cleared, `false()` if no lock was present

(But I'm really not sure what the function does in practice.)

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
