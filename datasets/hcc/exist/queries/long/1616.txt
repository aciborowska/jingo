Problem:
The `xslfo:render#4` function does not seem to work. The 4th parameter is the FOP config document. However when I supply a valid document to this parameter the answer is "URI is not absolute" It ried several variations but I cant get it working. 

We have code that uses this parameter that runs on older (at least 2.1) versions of eXist that now breaks.

Reproduce:
[eXist-backup-fo-rendertest.zip](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/files/1470723/eXist-backup-fo-rendertest.zip)
Restore this eXist backup file. It creates a collection /db/fo-rendertest.
Run the `fo-test.xq`. On my system this causes the "URI not absolute" error. 
Replacing the FOP config reference with () works.

Context:
- eXist-db version: 3.4.1 (cant find the GIT hash, sorry)
- Java version: 1.8.0_152
- Operating system: Windows 10 64 bits
- Any custom changes: None
