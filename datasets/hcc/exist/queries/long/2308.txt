### What is the problem
The `not()` function used in a predicate on a boolean sequence fails... I'm trying to count the number of false or true entries in a sequence of booleans. 

1. Counting the number of false entries:
    1. `count((true(), false(), false())[not(.)])` fails with the message: item of '(true, false, false)...' is not a node, and sequence length > 1
    1. `count((true(), false(), false())[. eq false()])` works
1. Counting the number of true entries:
   1. `count((true(), false(), false())[.])` works

Now 1.i. looks like a bug. In XSLT (Saxon) it simply works.

### What did you expect
That this expression `count((true(), false(), false())[not(.)])` works as expected and as it does in Saxon.
