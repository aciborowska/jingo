If a user is a member of the DBA group as their primary group and N other groups and then creates a resource/collection. The group owner of that collection could be any of the groups they are a member of instead of the DBA group.

To reproduce - 
1. Create a user, set their primary group to the DBA group.
2. Add them to _n_ other groups
3. Shutdown eXist
4. Startup eXist, login as your new user.
5. Create a Collection/Resource
6. The group owner of the resource could be any of the groups the user is a member of. Repeating steps 4 - 5 results in resources with different group members.

Solution - Resources/Collections should always be created with the users primary group.
