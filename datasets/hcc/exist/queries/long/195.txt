I just added some files with names like `a.a`, `coll.xc`, ... in `/db/system/config/db/test/`. I was expecting that only the `collection.xconf` file has any influence on the configuration.

But it seems as if every file (indepedent of its name) is used for index configuration or at least displayed in the admin panel under "indexes". This results in the attached screenshot

There are 6 different, contradictory entries for the collection `/db/test`.
