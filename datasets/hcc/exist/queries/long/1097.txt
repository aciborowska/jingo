If have come across a situation where

```
return $node/child1 and $node/child2
```

returns neither `true` nor `false` but nothing at all. **No exception is thrown**, either.

The code is available at https://gist.github.com/dariok/a4feb9ee14d58dff6aed0a2268cdf6d3
and you can see the result on a fairly fresh install of RC2 at http://dev2.hab.de:8080/exist/edoc/test/test3.xql

As you can see, both children can be accessed. If I check for the number of children, it works as well as can be seen in `dariok[@type='ondisk2']`.
