Since upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS a warning appears on every HTTP request to eXist:

```
WARN  (TransactionManager.java [close]:257) - Transaction was not committed or aborted, auto aborting!
```

Also, the broker pool is flooded, and transactions don't get handled anymore.

This might be unrelated to the Ubuntu upgrade, but there's not much else that has changed.
