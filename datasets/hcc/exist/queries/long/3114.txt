### What is the problem
An XPath expression of the form
```
//record[ft:query(.//field[@attr="value"], <phrase>text</phrase>)
```
ignores the `[@attr="value"]` predicate if a range index is defined on `@attr.`  The result of the expression is equivalent to:

```
//record[ft:query(.//field, <phrase>text</phrase>)
```
If the range index is removed, the xpath works as expected.

### What did you expect

See above.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
> Describe how we can can reproduce the problem.

The attached test demonstrates the difference in behavior when a range index is and is not present.
