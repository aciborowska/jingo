On windows 7, 32bit: machine is shut down cleanly, but eXist crashes and reinforces a recovery run upon restart. This used to work in the past, i.e. eXist received the shutdown signal and stopped properly before windows powered off the machine.

Could someone confirm if this happens on other windows versions as well?
