### What is the problem
 the ant task in build.xml for generating xhtml javadocs no longer works. 
[Here](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/blob/005045fda2ee0df0c3871b12d1b90a79f086ffbc/build/scripts/build-impl.xml#L425) 
This means that we have broken  links on exist-db.orgs webpage. See exist-db/documentation#140

### What did you expect
 the links not to end in `404`, and the ant task to actually generate javadoc files. 

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
 run  `ant javadoc`
