### What is the problem
A XAR file can set default username/group name as owner of the collection that is created when the XAR is extracted and installed (e.g. /db/apps/foo). The problem is that the same ownership is applied to /db/apps

### What did you expect
Only /db/apps/foo should get then new ownership

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
- in eXide create XAR file that introduces new username/password (maybe the Monex app can be used)
- install XAR via package manager
- check /db/apps ownership
