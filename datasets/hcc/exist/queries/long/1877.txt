When installing an EXPath Package to eXist-db, the deployment script changes the permissions on all Collections and Documents in the package when they are stored into the database.

See line https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/blob/develop/src/org/exist/repo/Deployment.java#L892

Basically the deployment sets these mode bits:
1. `owner +read`
2. `group +write`
3. `other +execute`

I find this very uncomfortable, in particular:
1. `group +write` which allows anyone in the deploying users group to modify the files in the package.
2. `other +execute` which allows any XQuery in the package to be executed by any user. This seems like a bad plan, as an app package may have its own security requirements and/or login processes.

I think this really has to be fixed!
I would particularly like to hear comments from @wolfgangmm @dizzzz @duncdrum and @joewiz.
