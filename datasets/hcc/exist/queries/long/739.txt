According to the spec, FLWOR expressions may contain any number of "order by" clauses intermingled with other clauses before the return. However, eXist only allows a single "order by" clause as the final clause before the return; all other uses result in a parse error.

For example, this is a valid XQuery that results in a parse error in eXist:

```
for $x in (3, 2, 4)
order by $x
for $y in (1 to $x)
return $y
```

This can usually be worked around by rearranging the clauses or using nested FLWOR expressions (eg. simply inserting a `return` clause between the `order by` and second `for` in the above example), but it's not always obvious how to do so while getting the same result.
