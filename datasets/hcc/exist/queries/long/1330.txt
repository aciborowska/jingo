The script [uninstallDaemon.sh](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/blob/develop/tools/yajsw/bin/uninstallDaemon.sh#L40) expects a systemd service install for user but this option has been removed by 140c718ae9793bc29fb156018d18386e239e358f.

The new service file (system-wide) is not removed and the running service is not stopped.
