This is a very nasty and bizarre bug...

```xquery
xquery version "3.1";

import module namespace http = "http://expath.org/ns/http-client";

let $result := http:send-request(
    <http:request method="get" href="https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;retmax=0&amp;rettype=count&amp;term=covid"/>
)
return

(: NOTE: Uncommenting the block below flips the order of the items in the $result sequence! :)
(:  
    if ($result/@status ne "200")
    then
        fn:error(xs:QName("local:bad-request"), $result)
    else
:)
    
        $result[1]
```

In the query above the $result sequence should always have the `http:response` element first. If you uncomment the commented out block, then the order of the items in the sequence becomes reversed somehow.

Also if instead of `if ($result/@status ne "200")` you were to write `if ($result[1]/@status ne "200")` then the order remains correct!
