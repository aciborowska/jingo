**Describe the bug**

I have discovered two more cases in which eXist fails to include the location of errors in queries.

**Expected behavior**

When reporting errors, eXist should always report the line number and position (or column and row) of errors.

See also https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/issues/3450.

**To Reproduce**

The error messages raised by the conditions in the predicates below fail to include the location of the error.

```xquery
map {
    "foo": ["bar", "baz"]
}[?foo eq "bar"]
```

eXist's error lacks location info:

> err:XPTY0004 Expected single atomic value but found array with length 2

BaseX returns the location:

> Stopped at /Users/joe/workspace/XQuery-for-Humanists/Test/file, 3/16:
> [XPTY0004] Item expected, sequence found: ("bar", "baz").

Saxon returns the location at line 3 column 4:

> A sequence of more than one item is not allowed as the first operand of 'eq' (["bar", "baz", ])

Similarly:

```xquery
map {
    "foo": 
        map { 
            "bar": "baz"
        }
}[?foo eq "bar"]
```

eXist's error lacks location info:

> err:FOTY0013 A function item other than an array cannot be atomized

BaseX returns:

> Stopped at /Users/joe/workspace/XQuery-for-Humanists/Test/file, 6/16:
> [FOTY0013] Items of type map(xs:string, xs:string?) cannot be atomized.

Saxon returns an error at line 6 column 4:

> An atomic value is required for the first operand of 'eq', but the supplied type is a map type, which cannot be atomized

eXist should be able to report column and line numbers of errors.
