In fact it appears to be doing nothing at all. I have to manually kill the thread. I've tried this on the most recent commit a277568192 and also the one from earlier today on two different machines. Both linux, one debain 7 and the other archlinux. Both with java 8. It was working fine the last few times I've updated. 

 More information available upon request.
