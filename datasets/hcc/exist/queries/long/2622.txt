### What is the problem
Nothing goes wrong but we get a lot of messages in the exist.log like these:

```
2019-04-02 15:34:42,729 [qtp1430358188-50914] WARN  (PathExpr.java [replace]:119) - Expression not found: $jblogin:key-db-username-column; in: false() 
2019-04-02 15:34:42,729 [qtp1430358188-50914] WARN  (PathExpr.java [replace]:119) - Expression not found: $jblogin:key-db-password-column; in: false() 
2019-04-02 15:34:42,729 [qtp1430358188-50914] WARN  (PathExpr.java [replace]:119) - Expression not found: $jblogin:key-db-exist-user; in: false() 
```

There are lots and lots of them. I tried to find out what they refer to but couldn't.

Sometimes it seems that eXist is warning me for a lookup in a map on a key that doesn't exist, but why should it? 


### What did you expect
I see no reason why eXist would warn me. The code runs ok, no errors.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
That's a problem, this is produced by a huge code base that isn't really portable. And I have no idea what exactly causes this. I'm sorry I cant be of more help here.

I suppose (?) that it is possible to look in the code and find out at least where and why this message is produced?
