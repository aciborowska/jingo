The previous version of Commons Daemon (1.1.0) ProcRun would run the Windows service under the Windows `LocalSystem` user account which is highly-privileged.

The new version (1.2.0) by default installs the service using the lesser privileged Windows `NT Authority\LocalService` user account.

Unfortunately the eXist-db service won't seem to start under that lower privileged account, I am not sure why yetâ€¦

We should investigate this, and get eXist-db Windows Service starting and running under the more secure `NT Authority\LocalService` user account.
