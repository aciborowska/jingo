Issue: dist creation fail (404 dashboard not found)
Process: clone, ./build.sh, ./build.sh dist
Problem: no autodeploy directory in dist result
Solution: copy autodeploy folder to dist directory
Forked and fixed by adding necessary stanza to dist.xml script

ps. startup.sh output complains about lib/test directory missing. Added mkdir lib/test to dist.xml.
