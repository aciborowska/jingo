When restoring a backup, if the backup contains older apps, then can easily overwrite the newer apps, or worse you end up with a mess of old apps with some orphaned newer files.

Restore should detect app versions and offer the user a choice about whether to replace the newer version with the older version, or ignore the older version.

Example:
---
**NOTE**: EXPath Apps shipped with previous version of eXist-db, are not guaranteed to be forwards compatible with RC8. As such when restoring a backup to RC8 you should at least exclude the following from your `/db/apps` folder:
1. `/db/apps/dashboard`
2. `/db/apps/doc`
3. `/db/apps/eXide`
4. `/db/apps/fundocs`
5. `/db/apps/markdown`
6. `/db/apps/monex`
7. `/db/apps/packageservice`
8. `/db/apps/shared-resources`

If in doubt, you should consider excluding `/db/apps` entrirely from your backup archive during the restore, and then subsequently installing the latest versions of the Apps you need via the Dashboard's Package Manager.
