When a new XMLString is constructed it takes a char array from the `CharArrayPool`. In many instances, neither `XMLString#reset()` or `XMLString#release()` is called, which means that array is never returned to the pool.

This quickly causes the pool to lease all its resources, which are never returned or released. We should ensure these are always returned to the pool. It might be prudent to also pool XMLString instances.

There are several other array pools too, we should likely check that those also don't leak.
