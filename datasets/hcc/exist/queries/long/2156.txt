### What is the problem

Support for the [context item declaration](https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/#id-context-item-declarations) was added in #1571. eXist's implementation correctly redefines the [context item expression](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/#id-context-item-expression) `.` to be the item from the declaration. 

However, eXist's implementation does not carry this through to redefine the node selected by `/` (which the XPath spec [defines](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/#id-path-expressions) as "an abbreviation for the initial step (`fn:root(self::node())` treat as `document-node()`)"). 

Instead, eXist treats `/` as `collection()`, even when a context item has been declared.

This was first reported by @martin-honnen in https://github.com/eXist-db/eXide/issues/204.

### What did you expect

I expected eXist to return the same result for `/` as its expanded form `fn:root(self::node())` when a context item has been declared.

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test

```xquery
xquery version "3.1";

declare context item := document {
    <root>
        <item>foo</item>
        <item>bar</item>
        <item>foo</item>
    </root>
};

. instance of document-node(),
self::node() instance of document-node(),
root(self::node()) instance of document-node(),
(/) instance of document-node()
```

This query returns `true(), true(), true(), false()`. The final result should also be `true()`.

(Unfortunately, XQSuite doesn't respect a context item declaration ... so a proper test would probably need to be implemented in java alongside the other tests for this feature in https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/blob/develop/test/src/org/exist/xquery/XQueryDeclareContextItemTest.java.)
