When serializing output as HTML5, the `<source>` tag is output with a separate closing tag, instead of being a self-closing tag -- it's an empty tag according to the specification:

http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/embedded-content-0.html#the-source-element

I think this is because the HTML5 serializer is a subclass of the XHTML serializer, and this uses a list of element names (emptyTags) to determine which tags should be output as self-closing tags, and "source" isn't on the list:

Outputting `<source>` with a separate closing tag results in validation errors from the HTML5 validator.
