**Describe the bug**

In eXist, errors involving unknown types caused by expressions like `<x/> instance of x`, `<x/> castable as x`, or `<x/> cast as x` lack location information.

**Expected behavior**

I expected the errors to report the location of the error in the query, as they do in BaseX and Saxon. As shown below, Saxon locates the error best of all.

**To Reproduce**

```xquery
xquery version "3.1";

let $instance-of := <x/> instance of x
return
    $instance-of
```

eXist error:

> exerr:ERROR Type: x is not defined

BaseX error:

> Stopped at 4/1: [XPST0051] Unknown type: x.

Saxon error:

> Unknown simple type x
>
> Start location: 3:38

The processors produce analogous results for the following variants:

```
xquery version "3.1";

let $castable-as := <x/> castable as x
return
    $castable-as
```

```
xquery version "3.1";

let $cast-as := <x/> cast as x
return
    $cast-as
```
