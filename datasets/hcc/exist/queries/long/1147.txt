The work from @ljo 's PR https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/1141 does not yet for macOS:
(added: same for ubuntu)

During startup the directory `tools/yajsw/${env.EXIST_HOME}/` ; the variable does not seem to be substituted?  

start with

``` bash
./tools/yajsw/bin/runConsole.sh
```

In the attached logfile the following line is relevant:

```
java.io.FileNotFoundException: ${env.EXIST_HOME}/tools/yajsw/tmp/in_-5209836399611897029$1476732036731 (Permission denied)
    at java.io.RandomAccessFile.open0(Native Method)
```

[error.txt](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/files/534495/error.txt)

setting EXIST_HOME manually does not fix the issue.
