Log4j2 is writing its logs relative to where eXist is started from, not relative to where eXist is installed.

There is a PR which attempted to fix that - https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/637. However the solution was not satisfactory.

I have submitted patches to the Log4j project here - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1050. As soon as the most recent bugfix is merged to their codebase, I will add a SNAPSHOT build to my [adamretter/exist/tree/log4j-2.5 branch](https://github.com/adamretter/exist/tree/log4j-2.5) and send over a PR.

**NOTE** This is absolutely required for eXist 3.0.
