The dispose method of an operator can be called without a successful call to initalizeState.

(for example a failure to load the checkpoint data, or any user exception during initializeState) 

This doesn't cause a real issue, since it happens within dispose() and in a try {} finally { super.dispose()} block,  but still might be confusing to users to see an NPE.
