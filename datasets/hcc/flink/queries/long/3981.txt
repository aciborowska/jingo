Duplicate TaskManager registrations shouldn't be logged with Exceptions in the ResourceManager. Duplicate registrations can happen if the TaskManager sends out registration messages too fast when the actual reply is not lost but still in transit.

The ResourceManager should simply acknowledge the duplicate registrations, leaving it up to the JobManager to decide how to treat the duplicate registrations (currently it will send an AlreadyRegistered to the TaskManager).

This change also affects our test stability because the Yarn tests check the logs for exceptions.
