When implementing a custom operator, it may be useful to be able to cancel the task it runs into due to an external event. As an example imagine an Operator that spawns a thread to do some work and forward the element to the next one. 
In this case, if an exception is thrown by that thread, then this will not be automatically propagated to the main thread, in order to cancel the task. In this case, it would be useful to cancel the task by that thread. This issue aims at adding exactly 
this functionality to the StreamTask. Currently a Task can do so, but this is not accessible to the StreamTask.
