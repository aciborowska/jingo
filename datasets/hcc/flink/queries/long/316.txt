We can get free open source licences for JProfiler if we put a text link / logo on our website. The question is where to put it. They prefer the frontpage or download page. I would prefer to put it in the footer cause it will destroy the look & feel of the site if we put it random in the download page in my opinion.

So, are there other opinions where to put the link / dislikes of the idea in general?
