The check_shaded_artifacts() checks have some shortcomings which render them (partially) ineffective:


	netty checks use wc -1 but should use wc -l
	(all) of these checks do not fail if the executed command fails (as can be seen from the netty checks that pass without the line counting being correct)



In the travis logs, this shows up as

./tools/travis_mvn_watchdog.sh: line 382: 10052 Terminated              watchdog
wc: invalid option -- '1'
Try 'wc --help' for more information.
./tools/travis_mvn_watchdog.sh: line 297: [: !=: unary operator expected
