By default, akka spawns 2x or 3x the number of cores in threads.

For the LocalFlinkMiniCluster, running on Travis (often 64 cores), with separate actor systems for jobmanager and multiple taskmanagers, this frequetly means >600 akka threads. Flink uses about 4 actors.

This simply eats unnecessary resources. I suggest to have at most 4 threads per actor system in test setups.
