I tried creating SparseVector with only one non-zero element. But I couldn't create it. Following code causes the problem.


val vec2 = SparseVector.fromCOO(3, (1, 1))



I got a compile error following:


Error:(60, 29) overloaded method value fromCOO with alternatives:
  (size: Int,entries: Iterable[(Int, Double)])org.apache.flink.ml.math.SparseVector <and>
  (size: Int,entries: (Int, Double)*)org.apache.flink.ml.math.SparseVector
 cannot be applied to (Int, (Int, Int))
    val vec2 = SparseVector.fromCOO(3, (1, 1))
                            ^
