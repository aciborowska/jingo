The CliFrontend installs the Security context based on the cli.configuration (CliFrontend#L985)which does not take into account dynamic properties (such as -yD or -D depending on the executor)

This makes it impossible for instance to configure kerberos by setting these configs as dynamic props.

We should first apply all the extra configs before installing the security context and running the command.
