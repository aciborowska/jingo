The StateBackendLoader creates a random subdirectory under HighAvailabilityOptions.HA_STORAGE_PATH for the MemoryStateBackend if no checkpointing directory has been specified (see StateBackendLoader.java:246). The problem is that this directory gets never removed after the MemoryStateBackend is closed. It is important to clean up these created directories.
