Good day!

 

Have I can see since this commit TaskManager uses 8,388,607 terabytes as maximum out of heap memory. I guess that not any system has so much memory and it may be a reason to kill java process by OOM Killer.

 

I suggest to decrease this value to reasonable value by default.

 

Right now I see only one way to overstep this hardcoded value: setup FLINK_TM_HEAP to 0, and specified heap size by hand over FLINK_ENV_JAVA_OPTS_TM. 

Thanks
