When I execute bin/start-cluster.sh on the master machine, actually the command `nohup /bin/bash -l /state/partition1/ysma/flink-1.4.1/bin/jobmanager.sh start cluster ...` is exexuted, which does not open the job manager.

I think there might be something wrong with the `-l` argument, since when I use the bin/jobmanager.sh start, everything is fine. Kindly point out if I've done any configuration wrong.
