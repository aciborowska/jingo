The YARN logs may occasionally contain this exception that occurs on shutdown:


14:55:18,819 ERROR akka.remote.RemoteActorRef                                    - swallowing exception during message send
akka.remote.RemoteTransportExceptionNoStackTrace: Attempted to send remote message but Remoting is not running.



Whitelisting the akka.remote.RemoteTransportExceptionNoStackTrace should make the tests more reliable.
