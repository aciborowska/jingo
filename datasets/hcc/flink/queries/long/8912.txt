Description

The Web UI renders error messages returned by the REST API incorrectly, e.g., on the job submission page. The JSON returned by the REST API is rendered as a whole. However, the UI should only render the contents of the errors field.

Steps to reproduce

Submit examples/streaming/SocketWindowWordCount.jar without specifying program arguments. Error message will be rendered as follows:

{"errors":["org.apache.flink.client.program.ProgramInvocationException: The program plan could not be fetched - the program aborted pre-maturely.\n\nSystem.err: (none)\n\nSystem.out: No port specified. Please run 'SocketWindowWordCount --hostname <hostname> --port <port>', where hostname (localhost by default) and port is the address of the text server\nTo start a simple text server, run 'netcat -l <port>' and type the input text into the command line\n"]}


Note that flip6 mode must be enabled.
