A user reported that when our Kinesis connector is used against Kinesalite (https://github.com/mhart/kinesalite), we're incorrectly determining already found shards as newly discovered:

I suspect the problem to be the mock Kinesis API implementations of Kinesalite doesn't completely match with the official AWS Kinesis behaviour.
