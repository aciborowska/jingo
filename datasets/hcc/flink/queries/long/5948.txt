At https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.3/dev/batch/zip_elements_guide.html, under "Zip with a Dense Index," the Python example shows using the camelcase-named zipWithIndex method, when in reality the proper method name is in snake case (zip_with_index). This is an error from my merged pull request which added zip_with_index to the Python API (https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2136/files#diff-635d49f032b2e71bd334e89368e93afeR77).
