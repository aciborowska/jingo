Any Exception thrown in BufferListener#notifyBufferAvailable will currently not trigger calling further listeners in LocalBufferPool#recycle() and only add the given memory segment to the queue of available ones.

Usually this will not be the last call to recycle() and future calls may call the listeners but this also introduces further delay in configurations with tight numbers of buffers in the local pool and listeners waiting on them when one task's listener was failing.
