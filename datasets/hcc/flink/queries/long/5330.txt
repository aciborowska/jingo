The KafkaConsumer08Test assumes that some of the Kafka bootstrap server hostname cannot be resolved. This can lead to failures if these names are wrongly resolved by chance (e.g. if using Google's DNS server). Moreover, the test cases take a long time to finish because the connection timeouts are set to a high value. This can be decreased to speed these test cases up.
