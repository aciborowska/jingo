When execute sql like this will throw exception "org.apache.calcite.sql.validate.SqlValidatorException: Column 'c1' not found in any table":



CREATE VIEW my_view AS SELECT T.a, T.b FROM source, LATERAL TABLE(MY_TABLE_FUNCTION(`c1`)) AS T(`a`, `b`)



Because of in SqlToOperationConverter#convertCreateView unparse SqlNode to sql string after validate, but the LATERAL keyword was missing at this point. Plus SqlNode validateQuery = flinkPlanner.validate(query), query == validateQuery.

I think we could use original sql to build CatalogViewImpl, they have the same functionality.
