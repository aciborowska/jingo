In HA case where the JobManager tries to recover all submitted job graphs, e.g. when regaining leadership, it can happen that none of the submitted jobs are recovered if a single recovery fails. Instead of failing the complete recovery procedure, the JobManager should still try to recover the remaining (non-failing) jobs and print a proper error message for the failed recoveries.
