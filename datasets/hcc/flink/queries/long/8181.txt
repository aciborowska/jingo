On fixing FLINK-6288 and migrating the original FlinkFixedPartitioner to the new partitioning API (commit 9ed9b68397b51bfd2b0f6e532212a82f771641bd), the FlinkFixedPartitioner no longer returns identical target partitions once a target topic is rescaled.

This results in a behavioral regression when the FlinkFixedPartitioner is used.

The FlinkFixedPartitionerTest should also be strengthened to cover the target topic rescaling case.
