The amazon client do not downgrade from CBOR to JSON while setting env AWS_CBOR_DISABLE to true (or 1) and/or defining com.amazonaws.sdk.disableCbor=true via JVM options. This bug is due to maven shade relocation of com.amazon.* classes. As soon as you cancel this relocation (by removing the relocation in the kinesis connector or by re-relocating in the final jar), it reruns again.
