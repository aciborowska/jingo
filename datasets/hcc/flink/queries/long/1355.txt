When running examples from the IDE, I see a warning that no logging backend is configured, and I see System.out printing from the client.

in 0.8, the client's sysout printing is disabled in the local mode.

We can change it to by default disable logging and enable the client sysout output, or vice versa, but I think we should not have both.
