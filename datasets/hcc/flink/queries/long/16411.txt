Some test stages invoke maven again, where additional dependencies are downloaded, sometimes failing the build.

This ticket is about using the Google mirror wherever possible.

Examples of failing tests:

A failure looks like this:


[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project flink-hadoop-fs: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.apache.flink:flink-hadoop-fs:jar:1.11-SNAPSHOT: Could not transfer artifact org.apache.flink:flink-shaded-hadoop-2:jar:2.8.3-10.0 from/to central (https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2): GET request of: org/apache/flink/flink-shaded-hadoop-2/2.8.3-10.0/flink-shaded-hadoop-2-2.8.3-10.0.jar from central failed: Connection reset -> [Help 1]
