The Scala API contains functions such as preserve, observe, neglect, uniqueKey etc. which can be used to specify compiler hints. However, they are not forwarded to the compiler. Thus an operation:

DataSet[A] ds = input.map
{ x=> x}
ds.preserve(x=>x, y=>y)

which should say that the fields stay constant, does not have an effect.
