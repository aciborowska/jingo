The GroupReduceITCase has an error that allows a problem with null Dates to go uncovered:
 If I set the parallelism to 1 in testDateNullException() and all keys actually end up on the same operator, then there is a problem in the de/serialization.

It seems that null values are somehow skipped by the serialization process (e.g. maybe no null indicator is written), which leads to wrong deserializations.
