This is minor.

Is it reasonable to add the `RuntimeContext` as an argument to the `open(Configuration)` method of stub functions? Can we do this without breaking stuff?

I would find it nice to replace the possibly repeated calls to `getRuntimeContext().getBroadcastVariable()`, `getRuntimeContext().addAccumulator()`, etc. with something like `context.getBroadcastVariable()`.
