We observed that, when deleting old checkpoint files, Flink failed to delete the dir of those checkpoint files. As a result, in our s3, we saw a bunch of the dirs with no files inside it:


- chk-100
- chk-101
- chk-102
...



I would expect that Flink should also delete the checkpoint file's dir while deleting the actual checkpoint files.
