On the page https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/apis/metrics.html
the following metrics parameters should be

faulty: metrics.scope.tm.task , should be metrics.scope.task
faulty: metrics.scope.tm.operator , should be metrics.scope.operator

to make it work on Flink 1.1.1.

But to fix this, the constants in ConfigConstants.java can also be changed to fit the documentation. Either way...
