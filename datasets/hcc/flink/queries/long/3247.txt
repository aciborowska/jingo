The Kafka Connector now requires Curator, which is referenced as flink-shaded-curator. The quickstarts make sure it is not packaged into the jar file via exclusions.

The curator classes are however only in relocated form in the flink-dist.jar - relocated manually in the flink-runtime project. The connector can thus not use find the Curator classes and fails.
