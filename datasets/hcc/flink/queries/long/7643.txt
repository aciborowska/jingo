HadoopFileSystem always reloads GlobalConfiguration, which potentially leads to a lot of noise in the logs, because this happens on each checkpoint.

Instead, file systems should be configured once upon process startup, when the configuration is loaded.

This will also increase efficiency of checkpoints, as it avoids redundant parsing for each data chunk.
