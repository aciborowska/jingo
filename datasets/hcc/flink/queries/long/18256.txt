The hadoop-common and hadoop-hdfs have been bundled into the flink-orc_2.11-1.11-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar. Since we suggest our users to put this jar into lib directory or add dependency in their pom to build fat jar, it might be incorrect to have hadoop here. Flink now is not hadoop free, we have some specific hadoop version classes in the released jars.

 

> How to fix?

Let flink-orc depends on hadoop-common and hadoop-hdfs directly and make them provided.
