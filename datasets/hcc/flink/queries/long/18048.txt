When we use the following command to start a Flink application cluster, the specified hostname could not take effect. The root cause is HOST_OPTION is not added to options in StandaloneApplicationClusterConfigurationParserFactory. It will be a critical issue when we deploy Flink on container environment. Because users usually want to specify a given hostname.

 


./bin/standalone-job.sh start --host external-hostname --job-classname org.apache.flink.streaming.examples.join.WindowJoin


 

For the old StandaloneJobClusterConfigurationParserFactory, it has the same issue.
