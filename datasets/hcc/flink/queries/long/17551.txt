When browsing Flink's documentation on the project website, we can choose from both the latest snapshot version and the stable release versions. However, it seems the documentation of stable release version is actually built on top of the snapshot version of the release branch.

E.g., currently the latest stable release is 1.10.0, but the documentation described as "Flink 1.10 (Latest stable release)" is actually built with 1.10-SNAPSHOT. As a consequence, users might be confused when they use release 1.10.0 and some latest documentation changes meant for 1.10.1.

This comment shows one of such confusions.
