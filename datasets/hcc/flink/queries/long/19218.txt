The LocalFileSystem returns file splits with a host information as returned via


InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName();



This might be different, though, from the host name that the TaskManager is configured to use, which results in incorrect location matching if this information is used.

It is also incorrect in cases where the file system is in fact not local, but a mounted NAS.

Since this information is anyways not useful (there no good way to support locality-aware file access for the LocalFileSystem) I would suggest to remove this code. That would be better than having code in place that tries to suggest locality information that is frequently incorrect.
