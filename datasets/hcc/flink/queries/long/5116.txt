The 1.1 series misses a factory for the rocks db backend. This means that 1.1. users cannot configure rocks DB via the config file and are forced to set it via the environment.

This has been recently added to 1.2-SNAPSHOT. It should be back ported to 1.1.4 (https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-contrib/flink-statebackend-rocksdb/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/contrib/streaming/state/RocksDBStateBackendFactory.java).
