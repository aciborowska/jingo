In the StreamExecutionEnvironment, the environment is once created and then shared with a static variable to all successive calls to getExecutionEnvironment(). But it can be overridden by calls to createLocalEnvironment() and createRemoteEnvironment().

This seems a bit un-intuitive, and probably creates confusion when dispatching multiple streaming jobs from within the same JVM.

Why is it even necessary to cache the "current" execution environment?
