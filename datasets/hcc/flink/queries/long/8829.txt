Hi,

We have running Flink 1.3.2 app in Amazon EMR with YARN. Every week our Flink job is down due to:

2018-02-16 19:00:04,595 WARN akka.remote.ReliableDeliverySupervisor - Association with remote system akka.tcp://[flink@ip-10-97-34-209.tr-fr-nonprod.aws-int.com:42177]] has failed, address is now gated for [5000] ms. Reason: [Association failed with [akka.tcp://[flink@ip-10-97-34-209.tr-fr-nonprod.aws-int.com:42177]]|mailto:flink@ip-10-97-34-209.tr-fr-nonprod.aws-int.com:42177]]] Caused by: [Connection refused: ip-10-97-34-209.tr-fr-nonprod.aws-int.com/10.97.34.209:42177] 2018-02-16 19:00:05,593 WARN akka.remote.RemoteWatcher - Detected unreachable: akka.tcp://[flink@ip-10-97-34-209.tr-fr-nonprod.aws-int.com:42177]] 2018-02-16 19:00:05,596 INFO org.apache.flink.runtime.client.JobSubmissionClientActor - Lost connection to JobManager akka.tcp://flink@ip-10-97-34-209.tr-fr-nonprod.aws-int.com:42177/user/jobmanager. Triggering connection timeout.

Do you have any ideas how to troubleshoot it?
