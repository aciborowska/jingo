The scripts to start and stop Flink (start/stop-local.sh, start/stop-cluster.sh, start/stop*streaming.sh) fail if the bin folder path contains spaces.
This is working properly in Flink 0.9.1

I assume that the problem is not with bin/config.sh, because bin/start-webclient.sh is working fine. 
Maybe something was broken by recent changes in bin/jobmanager.sh.
