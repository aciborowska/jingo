I have been trying to use the kubernetes session cluster manifests provided in the documentation. The -Dtaskmanager.host flag doesn't seem to pass through, meaning it uses the pod name as the host name. This wont work.

The current docs state the args should be:

 


args: 
- taskmanager 
- "-Dtaskmanager.host=$(K8S_POD_IP)"


 

I did manage to get it to work by using this manifest for the taskmanager instead. This did waste alot of time as it was very hard to find.


args: 

- taskmanager.sh
- -Dtaskmanager.host=$(K8S_POD_IP)
- -Djobmanager.rpc.address=$(JOB_MANAGER_RPC_ADDRESS)
