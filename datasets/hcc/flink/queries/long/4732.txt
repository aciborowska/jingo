We use the Maven Junction plugin http://pyx4j.com/pyx4j-maven-plugins/maven-junction-plugin/introduction.html to create a symbolic link to the build directory. On Windows, the plugin downloads an executable from the author's homepage which may be modified by an attacker. The plugin has not been updated since 2007 and the maintainer has not shown interest to fix the issue.

I propose to remove the plugin while this security threat persists.
