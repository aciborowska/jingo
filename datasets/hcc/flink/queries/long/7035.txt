Hard coding the region frequently causes cross-region network access which can in the worst cases could cause brown-out of AWS services and nodes, violation of availability requirements per region, security and compliance issues, and extremely poor performance for the end user's jobs.  All AWS nodes and services are aware of the region they are running in, please see:

Need to change the following line of code to use Regions.getCurrentRegion() rather than throwing an exception.  Also, code examples should be changed to reflect correct practices.
