We want to gradually reduce the hard and heavy mandatory dependencies in Hadoop. Hadoop will still be part of (most) flink downloads, but the API projects should not have a hard dependency on Hadoop.

I suggest to start with flink-core, because it only depends on Hadoop for the Writable type, to support seamless operation of Hadoop types.

I propose to move all WritableTypeInfo-related classes to the flink-hadoop-compatibility project and access them via reflection in the TypeExtractor.

That way, Writable types will be out of the box supported if users have the flink-hadoop-compatibility project in the classpath.
