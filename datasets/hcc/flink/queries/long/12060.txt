We have three places in `tools` that we use to update the pom versions when releasing:
1. https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/048367b/tools/change-version.sh#L31
2. https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/048367b/tools/releasing/create_release_branch.sh#L60
3. https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/048367b/tools/releasing/update_branch_version.sh#L52

The 1st option is buggy (it does not work with the new versioning of the shaded Hadoop build, e.g. 2.4.1-1.9-SNAPSHOT will not be replaced). The 2nd and 3rd work for pom files, but the 2nd one misses a change for the doc version that is present in the 3rd one.

I think we should unify these and call them where needed instead of duplicating this code in unexpected ways.

An initial quick fix could remove the 1st script and update the 2rd one to match the 3rd one.
