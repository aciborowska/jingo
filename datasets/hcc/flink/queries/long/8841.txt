Currently there are two class MapSerializer and HashMapSerializer whose code is the same with the only difference being that one includes elements of type Map and the other HashMap. 

In addition, these two were merged on the same commit. 

I would like to remove the HashMapSerializer. I already created a branch without the HashMapSerialzer and nothing seems to be failing on Travis. The reasons why I hesitate to do it, is because I am not sure if this may create problems with Backwards Compatibility.

Xiaogang Shi could you elaborate a bit on why they were both added and if there is any danger in removing the HashMapSerializer?

Also [~StephanEwen] and Stefan Richter it is worth having a look and if you are ok, I can remove the redundant serializer.
