I am receiving the following exception when running a simple job that extracts outdegree from a graph using Gelly. It is currently only failing on the cluster and I am not able to reproduce it locally. Will try that the next days.

The error occurs in Gellys Graph.java at this line: https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/a51c02f6e8be948d71a00c492808115d622379a7/flink-staging/flink-gelly/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/graph/Graph.java#L636

Is there any valid case where a coGroup Iterator may be empty? As far as I see there is a bug somewhere.

I'd like to write a test case for this to reproduce the issue. Where can I put such a test?
