HI, 
I have set up a flink 1.4 cluster with 1 job manager and two task managers. 
The configs taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots and parallelism.default were set 
to 2 on each node. I submitted a job to this cluster and it runs fine. To 
test fault tolerance, I killed one task manager. I was expecting the job to 
run fine because one of the 2 task managers was still up and running. 
However, the job failed. Am I missing something?
