The distributed cache has a variety of issues at the moment.


	It does not give a proper exception when a non-cached file is accessed
	It swallows I/O exceptions that happen during file transfer and later only returns null
	It keeps inonsistently reference counts and attempts to copy often, resolving this via file collisions
	Files are not properly removes on shutdown
	No shutdown hook to remove files when process is killed
