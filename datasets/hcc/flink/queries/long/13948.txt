In the situation where there is a merging window, if we've performed a merge into a new window, and another window comes into the set that is exactly identical to the window created by the merge, the state window is replaced by the incoming window, and we lose the previous state.

 

Example:

Window (1,2) comes in to an empty set. The mapping is (1,2) -> (1,2)

Window (1,3) comes into the set,  we merge. The mapping is (1,3) -> (1,2)

Window (1,3) comes into the set, we don't merge. The new mapping is (1,3) -> (1,3). This mapping will cause us to lose the previous state when its persisted.
