Currently, when a Trigger sets a timer and that timer fires in the future at a point when there is currently no data in the window state, then that timer is being ignored.

This is a problem for some users because they manually set cleanup timers and they need to be called because the trigger needs to cleanup some state. (For normal time windows this is not a problem, but for special cases built on top of GlobalWindows the current behaviour leads to problems.)
