One goal of HiveCatalog and hive integration is to enable Flink-Hive interoperability, that is Flink should understand existing Hive meta-objects, and Hive meta-objects created thru Flink should be understood by Hive.

Taking an example of a Hive view v1 in HiveCatalog and database hc.db. Unlike an equivalent Flink view whose full path in expanded query should be hc.db.v1, the Hive view's full path in the expanded query should be db.v1 such that Hive can understand it, no matter it's created by Hive or Flink.

Rui Li can you help to ensure that Flink can also query Hive's view in both Flink planner and Blink planner?
