The start scripts `bin/start-local.sh` etc. are not working correctly on Mac OS X. 

```
ozone  ./bin/start-local.sh 
expr: syntax error
expr: syntax error
expr: syntax error
expr: syntax error
expr: syntax error
expr: syntax error
expr: syntax error
Starting Nephele job manager
```

I think this was introduced by Issue (#60 | FLINK-60).

The problem seems to be the `expr substr` calls in `nephele-config.sh`. On OS X the manpage for `expr` says the following:

> According to the POSIX standard, the use of string arguments length, substr, index, or match produces undefined results. In this version of expr, these arguments are treated just as their respective string values."

On Linux systems `expr substr` works fine.
