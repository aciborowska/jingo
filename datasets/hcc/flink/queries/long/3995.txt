All valuable test utils are only found in test-jars, but should be found in the compile scope of the test util projects.

	TestLogger
	RetryRules
	MiniClusters
	TestEnvironments
	...



Additionally, we have dependencies where the compile scope of some projects depends on test-jars of other projects. That can create problems in some builds and with some tools.

Here is how we can fix that:


	Create a flink-testutils-core project, which has the test utils currently contained in the flink-core test-jar in the main scope. That means the flink-core test-jar is not needed by other projects any more.
	Make the Mini Cluster available in flink-test-utils main scope.
	To remove the test-jar dependency on flink-runtime from the flink-test-utils project, we need to move the test actor classes to the main scope in flink-runtime.
