Before the recent rework of stream operators to be push based, operators held the semantics that any input (and also output to be specific) will not be mutated afterwards. This was achieved by simply copying records that were passed to other chained operators.

This feature has been removed thus introducing a major break in the operator mutability guarantees. 

To make chaining viable in all cases (and to prevent hidden bugs) we need to reintroduce the copying logic.
