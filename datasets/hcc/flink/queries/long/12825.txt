In commits: 4946cf4d6ab0f502f065825e157c7cabde604fe1 and 851d27bb54596d1044a831160b09aad9f3b32316 a Deprecate annotations were added to BatchTableSink and BatchTableSource. This is incorrect. They are still valid and the only supported interfaces for legacy planner. We cannot deprecate them until we deprecate the whole planner and I am not aware of such plans for 1.9.

Also the deprecation comment is very misleading as you cannot use the Output/Input format versions with legacy planner.
