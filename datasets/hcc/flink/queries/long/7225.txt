When the type extraction fails in the StateDescriptor constructor an exception is thrown, but the message is cutoff and doesn't contain any advice to remedy the situation.


try {
			this.typeInfo = TypeExtractor.createTypeInfo(type);
		} catch (Exception e) {
			throw new RuntimeException("Cannot create full type information based on the given class. If the type has generics, please", e);
		}
