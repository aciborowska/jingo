Introduce the TimestampedFileInputSplit which extends the class FileInputSplit and also contains:
i) the modification time of the file the split belongs to and also, and
ii) when checkpointing, the point the reader is currently reading from.

The latter will be useful for rescaling. With this addition, the ContinuousFileMonitoringFunction sends TimestampedFileInputSplits 
to the Readers, and the Readers' state now contain only TimestampedFileInputSplits.
