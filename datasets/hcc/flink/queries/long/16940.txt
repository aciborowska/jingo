The currentRegion HashSet in PipelinedRegionComputeUtil is created with an initialCapacity of 1. This is wrong because when we add the first element, the sets capacity will be already increased. From the style guidelines:

Set the initial capacity for a collection only if there is a good proven reason for that, otherwise do not clutter the code. In case of Maps it can be even deluding because the Mapâ€™s load factor effectively reduces the capacity.
