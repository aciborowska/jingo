As reported by [~till.rohrmann] in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-6996 there seems to be a test instability with `Kafka010ProducerITCase>KafkaProducerTestBase.testOneToOneAtLeastOnceRegularSink`

https://travis-ci.org/tillrohrmann/flink/jobs/258538641

It is probably related to log.flush intervals in Kafka, which delay flushing the data to files and potentially causing data loses on killing Kafka brokers in the tests.
