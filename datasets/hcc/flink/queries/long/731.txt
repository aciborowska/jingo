Currently, there is no way to pass parameters to an aggregator or a convergence criterion. @StephanEwen has suggested to add support for this by changing the code for aggregators and convergence criterion to take an object, rather than a class, i.e. instead of 
`iteration.registerAggregator("my aggregator", Customaggregator.class)`
do something like this:
`iteration.registerAggregator("my aggregator", new CustomAggregator(params));`

I can start working on this, but I have a question: What should the type of `params` be?
