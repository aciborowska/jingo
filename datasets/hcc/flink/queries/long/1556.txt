If an exception occurs during job submission the JobClient received a SubmissionFailure. Upon receiving this message, the JobClient terminates itself and returns the error to the Client. This indicates to the user that the job has been completely failed which is not necessarily true. 

If the user directly after such a failure submits another job, then it might be the case that not all slots of the formerly failed job are returned. This can lead to a NoRessourceAvailableException.

We can solve this problem by waiting for the completion of the job failure in the JobClient.
