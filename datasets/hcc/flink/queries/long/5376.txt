The following are two examples where ordered stream element queue is mentioned:


        LOG.debug("Put element into ordered stream element queue. New filling degree " +
          "({}/{}).", numberEntries, capacity);

        return true;
      } else {
        LOG.debug("Failed to put element into ordered stream element queue because it " +


I guess OrderedStreamElementQueue was coded first.
