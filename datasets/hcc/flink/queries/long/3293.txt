FLINK-2298 introduced a custom name for the job.

This is ignored when the yarn application is started as part of the job submission, e.g.

   flink run -m yarn-cluster -ynm myname

It is always set using the classname as program name

    flinkYarnClient.setName("Flink Application: " + programName);

The client get's constructed using

   AbstractFlinkYarnClient flinkYarnClient = CliFrontendParser.getFlinkYarnSessionCli().createFlinkYarnClient(commandLine);

So the name will be parsed correctly, it is just overwritten.
This should be a fallback, when no name is provided
