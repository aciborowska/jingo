Exception message seems to be inexact. 
Also if there is no SAM, sam would be null upon returning from the method.

The suggestion from a review was to change the message and add a check (for null sam) prior to returning.

Another suggestion is to check if the given method is an interface, as only for interface it is possible to pass lambda.
