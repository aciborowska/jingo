Running the KMeansIterative example job I noticed the following:

If one of the k centers has no point attached to it (after computing the point to center distances and assigning the nearest center to every point) the job output does not contain all k centers. I had the following centers file (generated by the sample data generator):

```
1|-34.15|-8.99|
2|18.65|47.05
```
The resulting centers file contained only a single point `1|-20.66|-4.25|` when it should also contain the point `18.65, 47.05`, which wasn't reassigned during execution.

I think this can only happen if the initial centers contain outliers.

Even though this isn't terribly important I wanted to keep track of it. One possible solution would be to sample the points for initial centers instead of providing them by hand. Some kind of system support for data sampling might also be interesting in other cases.
