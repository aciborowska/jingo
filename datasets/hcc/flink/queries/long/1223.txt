The CSV Parser currently does not interpret escaped values

The example from here
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values#Example


Year,Make,Model,Description,Price
1997,Ford,E350,"ac, abs, moon",3000.00
1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition""","",4900.00



Does not work currently.

Here escaping inside the string field generates an error.

For reference 

An interesting post about the fallacies that could be encountered when parsing CSV files.
