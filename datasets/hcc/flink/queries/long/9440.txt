Currently the TimerService allows one to register timers, but it is not possible to delete a timer or to reset a timer to a new value. Â If one wishes to reset a timer, one must also handle the previous inserted timer callbacks and ignore them.

I would be useful if the API allowed one to remove and reset timers.
