Currently, the LocalExecutor which executes program in a local environment starts a new cluster and tears it down on every call to execute. This can take up a lot of time since a program might trigger execution several times. 

Further, it is semantically different from the RemoteExecutor as in the latter, the actors always stay the same.

A restart of actors in itself prevents any sharing of results across different executions. [A Persist operation.]
