When building with JDK 11, the build fails with this:


 [java] WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
 [java] WARNING: Illegal reflective access by org.dom4j.io.SAXContentHandler (file:/home/shannon/ws/javaxmail-spotbugs/.m2/repository/dom4j/dom4j/1.6.1/dom4j-1.6.1.jar) to method com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.parsers.AbstractSAXParser$LocatorProxy.getEncoding()
 [java] WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of org.dom4j.io.SAXContentHandler
 [java] WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
 [java] WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in future versions



According to https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/issues/499, this is because the current Spotbugs version we use (3.1.1) uses an outdated Dom4j version.

Upgrading to the latest Spotbugs stable version (3.1.12) fixes this issue.
