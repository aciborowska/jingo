The webinterface of the JobManager shows at most 5 finished jobs. This is because only the last 5 JobGraphs are remembered in the JobManager.
The same might apply to canceled and failed jobs.

I think this is very confusing to users and could be easily fixed. 
We should add three simple counters in the JobManager to correctly track these numbers and give the right counts to the webinterface.
