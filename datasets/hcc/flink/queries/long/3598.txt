I get the error java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.flink.api.java.typeutils.TypeExtractor.createTypeInfo when I run the following Gist: https://gist.github.com/Cellcote/e4195134809b7ec0e7b3

This gist was based on the example here: https://github.com/eBay/Flink/blob/master/flink-libraries/flink-gelly/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/graph/example/GSASingleSourceShortestPaths.java

I don't know if I am doing something wrong but it is a weird error on a function which I don't have control over.
