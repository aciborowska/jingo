I propose to configure travis in a way that changes in stratosphere/stratosphere trigger re-running the tests in in other project that depend on stratosphere i.e. stratosphere-sopremo and other essential projects.
By that we could expand the "test coverage" without much effort and would have a chance to discover errors that are hard to detect manually, especially if there are dependencies to the -SNAPSHOT version.
