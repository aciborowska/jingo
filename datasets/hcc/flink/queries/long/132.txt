Hi residents of the Stratosphere,

I found it a bit difficult to get a big picture of the memory usage of Ozone so I created this small comparison graphic (ozone vs. yarn). You can ignore yarn...

Can someone confirm that it looks like this on the high level?

Having such high level picture in the documentation would be great (with the relevant names of the configuration options added). I also omitted details like default values (memory manager now defaults to 0.7*(heap space) if I read correctly from source)


	
	
		
		
			
			
				Network Buffers
First I thought (and heard) that the network buffers are direct buffers and not taken from the heap space. But during my experiments (cloud-11) I found out that they seem to be taken from the heap space:
			
			
		
		
	
	



*Settings that did not work*
DEFAULT_NEPHELE_TM_HEAP: 10GB
taskmanager.memory.size: 8GB
Network buffers: 4GB (numberBuffers: 32 KB bufferSize: 128 KB)
=> Task manager did not start, not enough heap space for 8+4 GB

	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

*Settings that worked*
DEFAULT_NEPHELE_TM_HEAP: 10GB
taskmanager.memory.size 8GB
Network buffers: 1GB (numberBuffers: 32 KB bufferSize: 32 KB]
=> worked, there is 1GB heap space left
