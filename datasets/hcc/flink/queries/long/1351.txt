The taskmanager currently registers at the jobmanager by resolving the akka URL


val jobManager = context.actorSelection(jobManagerAkkaURL)



When the actor lookup fails (actor systems cannot connect), it gives an unspecific timeout message. This is the case when the TaskManager cannot connect to the JobManager.

This should be fixed to give a conclusive error message.
I suggest to add a test where TaskManager is started without JobManager actor system being available.
