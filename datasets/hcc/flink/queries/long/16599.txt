CREATE TABLE source {
  origin STRING,
  col1 AS FUN_1(origin),
  col2 AS FUN_2(col1),
  col3 AS FUN_3(col1)
}



Throws "Unknown identifier 'col1'  ".

I konw maybe is not a bug, because of computed column implementation logic. But I think it's a little bit inconvenient case I have to write like this.


CREATE TABLE source {
  origin STRING,
  col2 AS FUN_2(FUN_1(origin)),
  col3 AS FUN_3(FUN_1(origin))
}
