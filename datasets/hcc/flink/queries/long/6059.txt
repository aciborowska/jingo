It is not possible to automatically extract proper type information for Row because it is not typed with generics and holds values in an Object[].
Consequently is handled as GenericType<Row> unless a RowTypeInfo is explicitly specified.

This can lead to unexpected behavior when converting a DataSet<Row> or DataStream<Row> into a Table. If the data set or data stream has a GenericType<Row>, the rows are treated as atomic type and converted into a single field.

I think we should reject input types of GenericType<Row> when converting data sets and data streams and request a proper RowTypeInfo.
