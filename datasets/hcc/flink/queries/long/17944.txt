When I run the following sql example, I get the wrong output



SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM (VALUES ('Bob'), ('Alice'), ('Greg'), ('Bob')) AS NameTable(name) GROUP BY name;

                      Bob                         1
                     Alice                         1
                      Greg                         1
                       Bob                         2 


This is due to we add kind in Row, so the sematics of equals method changes
