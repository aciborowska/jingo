I have a task that runs on two cluster nodes.
The output is set to "file:///home/rmetzger/cmpDiscount/", the `FileDataSink` has a DOP of 64.

After the job has finished, on host1, there is a directory in `/home/rmetzger/` called `cmpDiscount/` with 32 files inside.
On host2 on the other hand, there is only one file in my home directory, called `cmpDiscount`. So only one of the 32 threads on host2 writes into the file system?
