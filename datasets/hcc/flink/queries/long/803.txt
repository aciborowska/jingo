This PR contains the new String Annotations. Constant sets are not annotated with a string array. 
The parsing is done in the new SemanticPropUtil class. There is also a test case for this class.

What is left is additional functionality like a * operator. Also it would be nice to be able to add the annotation strings to the operators via functions.
Example:
@ConstantFields(
{"1->2", "2->3,4,5"}
)
