The download page currently links to https://dist.apache.org/ for the KEYS, hashes and sigs.

However that host is only intended as a staging area for use by developers.

Please can you change the links to use the ASF webserver instead?

i.e.. change
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/...
to
https://www.apache.org/dist/...
wherever it appears.

Thanks
