Akka expects the actor's URL to be exactly matching.

As pointed out here, cases where users were complaining about this: http://apache-flink-user-mailing-list-archive.2336050.n4.nabble.com/Error-trying-to-access-JM-through-proxy-td3018.html


	Proxy routing (as described here, send to the proxy URL, receiver recognizes only original URL)
	Using hostname / IP interchangeably does not work (we solved this by always putting IP addresses into URLs, never hostnames)
	Binding to multiple interfaces (any local 0.0.0.0) does not work. Still no solution to that (but seems not too much of a restriction)




I am aware that this is not possible due to Akka, so it is actually not a Flink bug. But I think we should track the resolution of the issue here anyways because its affecting our user's satisfaction.
