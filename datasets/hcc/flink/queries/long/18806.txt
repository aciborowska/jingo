With the following (wrong) configuration setting in flink-conf.yaml, a taskmanager will not start up, basically print nothing on the command line, and have no log file to look at:



taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction: '0.4'



Console output:


> ./bin/start-cluster.sh 
Starting cluster.
Starting standalonesession daemon on host Nico-PC.lan.
[ERROR] The execution result is empty.
[ERROR] Could not get JVM parameters and dynamic configurations properly.
