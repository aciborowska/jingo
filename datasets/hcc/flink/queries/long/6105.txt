When catching InterruptedException, we should throw InterruptedIOException instead of IOException.

The following example is from HadoopInputFormatBase :


    try {
      splits = this.mapreduceInputFormat.getSplits(jobContext);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      throw new IOException("Could not get Splits.", e);
    }



There may be other places where IOE is thrown.
