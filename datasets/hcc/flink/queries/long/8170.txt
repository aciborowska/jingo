I did an OWASP dependency check on my flink project and it reports two problems for netty version 4.0.27.Final:

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2156
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4970

According to #FLINK-3151  there was a memory problem with newer versions.
I couldn't find a reference to that problem in the netty issues. Perhaps it's already fixed with newer versions (netty 4.0.27 was release in Apr, 2015).
Unfortunatelly I'm not that familiar with flink yet, to build a setup to reproduce the memory problem. Can anyone try it with a newer version of netty (4.0.53.Final is the latest of 4.0)?

I came across an article about finding netty memory leaks with ByteBuf, perhaps that can help:
