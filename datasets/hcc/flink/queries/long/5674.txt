I don't know if I did something wrong. I started Flink 1.2 RC2 with start-cluster.sh and started another taskmanager.sh start. I'm printing lines with dataset.print() and System.out.println(), but both outputs do not occur in the log files/out files or web interface. This only applies if the job has been submitted through the web interface.
