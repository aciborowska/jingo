The tests in SavepointITCase and SavepointMigrationTestBase do not cancel running jobs before exit. It will cause exceptions in {{TaskExecutor}}s and unreleased memory segments. Succeeding tests may fail due to insufficient amount of memory.

The problem is caused by cancelling {{TaskExecutor}}s with running tasks. Another issue caused by the reason can be seen in FLINK-11343. Maybe we can find a more dedicated method to cancel those {{TaskExecutor}}s still having running tasks.
