private void terminatedPodsInMainThread(List<KubernetesPod> pods) {
   getMainThreadExecutor().execute(() -> {
      for (KubernetesPod pod : pods) {
         if (pod.isTerminated()) {
            ...
         }
      }
   });
}


Looks like that the RM only remove the pod from ledger if the pod "isTerminated", 

and the pod has been taken accounted after being created.

However, it is not complete by checking pod "isTerminated", e.g. a Pending pod is deleted manually.

After that, a new job requires more resource can not trigger the allocation of a new pod.

 

Pls let me know if i misunderstand, thanks.
