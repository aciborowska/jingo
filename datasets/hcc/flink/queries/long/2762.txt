At the conclusion of my job the following is written to the console.


09/24/2015 13:40:48	Job execution switched to status FINISHED.
Job Runtime: -1 ms



org.apache.flink.client.program.Client.runBlocking(PackagedProgram, int) calls JobExecutionResult.fromJobSubmissionResult(JobSubmissionResult) which creates a "dummy object for wrapping a JobSubmissionResult" with netRuntime set to -1 and accumulators set to null.
