In this build (https://travis-ci.org/zentol/flink/builds/347373839) I set the codebase to flip6 for half the profiles to find failing tests.

The "libraries" job (https://travis-ci.org/zentol/flink/jobs/347373851) failed with an OutOfMemoryError.

This could mean that there is a memory-leak somewhere.
