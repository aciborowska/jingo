If I activate the scala-2.11 profile from within IntelliJ (and thus deactivate the scala-2.10 profile) in order to build Flink with Scala 2.11, then Flink cannot be built. The problem is that some Scala macros cannot be expanded because they were compiled with the wrong version (I assume 2.10).

This makes debugging tests with Scala 2.11 in IntelliJ impossible.
