The PojoSerializerConfigSnapshot tries to deserialize Pojo Fields. If the underlying Pojo class changed such that a formerly present field is not longer part of the Pojo, then the deserialization of the PojoSerializerConfigSnapshot will fail. As a consequence of this failure, there is no possibility to do state migration (e.g. skipping over this field when reading old data).

I think it is better to simply store the field name in the PojoSerializerConfigSnapshot and try to resolve the fields in the PojoSerializer#ensureCompatibility method. That way it is possible to construct a ConvertDeserializer allowing for state migration.
