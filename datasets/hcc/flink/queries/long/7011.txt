In general, the test testStartFromKafkaCommitOffsets implementation is a bit of an overkill. Before continuing with the test, it writes some records just for the sake of committing offsets to Kafka and waits for some offsets to be committed (which leads to the instability), whereas we can do that simply using the test base's OffsetHandler.
