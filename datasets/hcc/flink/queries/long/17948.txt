My job is following:

 


CREATE TABLE currency (
  currency_id BIGINT,
  currency_name STRING,
  rate DOUBLE,
  currency_timestamp  TIMESTAMP,
  country STRING,
  precise_timestamp TIMESTAMP(6),
  precise_time TIME(6),
  gdp DECIMAL(10, 6)
) WITH (
   'connector' = 'jdbc',
   'url' = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/flink',
   'username' = 'root',
   'password' = '123456',
   'table-name' = 'currency',
   'driver' = 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver',
   'lookup.cache.max-rows' = '500',
   'lookup.cache.ttl' = '10s',
   'lookup.max-retries' = '3')



When select * from currency, the precision of results are not as same as expected. � The precision of field precise_timestamp is 3 not 6, and the field gdp has more digit as expected. 

 



The data in mysql is following:
