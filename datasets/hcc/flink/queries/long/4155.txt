Currently the Flink Kafka producer does not really do any error handling if something is wrong with the partition metadata as it is serialized with the user function.

This means that in some cases the job can go into an error loop when using the checkpoints. Getting the partition info in the open method would solve this problem (like restarting from a savepoint which re-runs the constructor).
