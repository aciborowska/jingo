While testing Flink, I've discovered the following problem: when the config can't be correctly parsed, the task manager startup just fails.

I'm not sure whether it is a bash script problem or also applies to the Java parser.

To reproduce:
I had "20.000" instead of "20000" configured for the number of network buffers (with a "dot" separator).
