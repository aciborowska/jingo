Create a short tutorial for intelliJ users in Readme.md file.
For example: how to run the WordCount example (locally) from the IDE in less then 5 minutes after pulling the latest stratosphere git repo.
=> Encourage the usage of IDE's and local-execution for newbies.

My Idea:
1) File->Import Project->From External Model->Maven->Check all 6 checkboxes->NextNextNext ...
2) Collapse stratosphere-java-examples->eu.stratosphere.example.java.wordcount.WordCount.java -> RightClick on the file -> Click "Run WordCount.main() -> Enjoy
3) Next: show where to put new projects and data.txt files
(BTW: Great job for making the examples run on a mouse click with default params ! )

Also:
To the readers of Quickstart:
Ok its great to run the WordCount.jar from the CLI but what next? How can the user analyze/modify WordCount.java or maybe write a new CustomJob.java project?
A side-note there would be great.
