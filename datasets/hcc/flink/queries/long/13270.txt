	Submitting a job that source is Kafka, and Kafka partition is 1 , if set source Parallelism to 4,the job will be submitted successfully and source operator is RUNNING status but three Parallelism task is FINISHED
	checkpoint will abort when org.apache.flink.runtime.checkpoint.CheckpointCoordinator#triggerCheckpoint trigger and return CheckpointTriggerResult(CheckpointDeclineReason.NOT_ALL_REQUIRED_TASKS_RUNNING), this job do not have a successful checkpoint and lost runtime status
	Here is the log





July 15th 2019, 19:29:43.230 Checkpoint triggering task Source: org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.FlinkKafkaConsumer@132e3594-Stream -> Calc(where: (CAST(msg) LIKE '%我们%'), select: (CAST(msg) AS kkey, CAST(key) AS msg)) -> SinkConversion to Row (1/4) of job 2e1b28950a38d62803a9840609b55612 is not being executed at the moment. Aborting checkpoint.

We want to be able to trigger checkpoint and store it if we have a finished node in operator,or we want to be able to check Parallelism problem when we submit the job(eg : if Parallelism  > kafkaPartition then submit unsuccessfully)
