A build failed once on the test method testExceptionForwarding() in AsynchonousPartialSorterITCase. 
I ran the build without any changes again and it did not fail.

Unfortunately, I did not keep the Stacktrace. :worried: 
So this is just to remember that there might be an issue with AsynchonousPartialSorterITCase.
