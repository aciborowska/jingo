For the following DDL, we just omits the unrecognized property 'records-per-second'.


CREATE TABLE MyDataGen (
  int_field int,
  double_field double,
  string_field varchar
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'datagen',
  'records-per-second' = '1'  -- should be rows-per-second
)


IMO, we should throw Exceptions to tell users that they used a wrong property.
