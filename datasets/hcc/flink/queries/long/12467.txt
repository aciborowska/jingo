Since the DataStreamAllroundTestProgram does not define a minimum pause between checkpoints it can happen that the CheckpointCoordinator attempts to start a checkpoint while another one is still on-going.
This results in a failed checkpoint if this checkpoint exceeds the maximum number of concurrent checkpoints, which in our e2e tests results in a test failure since the logs contain exceptions.
