The CheckpointCoordinator register a canceller task for each running checkpoint. The canceller task's responsibility is to cancel a checkpoint if it takes too long to complete. We should cancel this task as soon as the checkpoint has been completed, because otherwise we will keep many canceller tasks around. This can eventually lead to an OOM exception.
