There is an issue in which the special character "+" is not removed from the data stream / operator name which causes metrics for the operator to not be properly returned. Code Reference:

https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/metrics/dump/MetricQueryService.java#L208

 

For example if the operator name is:

pulsar(url: pulsar+ssl://192.168.1.198:56014)

Metrics for an operator with the above name will always return empty.
