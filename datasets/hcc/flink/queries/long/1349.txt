There are a few remaining cleanup:


	There are still various config constants relating to the old RPC
	There is still a bit of unused code and utilities from the old RPC
	The Writable/IOReadableWritable serialzation buffer start size should be smaller (most messages are rather small)
	For message logging, make system calls (timestamps) only in debug mode
	Add serial version UIDs to all serializable classes
