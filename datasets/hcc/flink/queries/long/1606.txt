The JobManagerFailsITCase fails spuriously for the Hadoop-2.0.0-alpha build profile on Travis.

The reason is that this build profile uses an older Akka version, namely 2.2.1, which behaves differently than newer versions. In case of a connection loss to the JobManager, the JobManager's address is quarantined for 60 s which prevents the TaskManager from reconnecting to a restarted JobManager.

We can fix this by setting the quarantine and gate time to low values.
