It seems like the example in the Spargel guide hasn't been updated for the past few versions.
The example code uses a SpargelIteration, FileDataSource, FileDataSink and creates a Plan.

We could either update the example there or, since we're going to deprecate Spargel, we could remove the example from the guide and add the correct version in the Spargel-to-Gelly migration guide (FLINK-1871).
