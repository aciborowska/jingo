I download 1.10.0 version from the release ASF links and try to run on Windows with different jdk version but I am getting error related missing configuration keys. I try to add them but it I hit some sort of "min and max limit misalignment error message" that I couldn't fix. 

Having said that 1.9.2 doesn't have any issue in same environment.  

Please refer log file for more detail.
