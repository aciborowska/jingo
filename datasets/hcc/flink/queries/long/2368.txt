Add a convergence criteria for the Machine Learning library. If an algorithm is iteration based, it should have a setConvergenceCritieria function which will check for convergence at the end of every iteration based on the user defined criteria. 
Algorithm writer will provide the user will the training data set, solution before an iteration and solution after the iteration and user will have to return an empty data set in case the training needs to be terminated.
