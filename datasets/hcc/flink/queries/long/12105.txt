I ran into this while experimenting with different values at Lyft eng. However it is reproducible with https://github.com/ververica/sql-training as well. I showed this issue to the training instructors during flink-forward-19 and they asked me to file this bug.

The INTERVAL values work fine until 99. Errors after that:

TUMBLE(rideTime, INTERVAL '100' SECOND)

org.apache.calcite.sql.validate.SqlValidatorException: Interval field value 100 exceeds precision of SECOND(2) field

TUMBLE(rideTime, INTERVAL '100' MINUTE)

org.apache.calcite.sql.validate.SqlValidatorException: Interval field value 100 exceeds precision of MINUTE(2) field

TUMBLE(rideTime, INTERVAL '100' HOUR)

org.apache.calcite.sql.validate.SqlValidatorException: Interval field value 100 exceeds precision of HOUR(2) field

TUMBLE(rideTime, INTERVAL '100' DAY)

org.apache.calcite.sql.validate.SqlValidatorException: Interval field value 100 exceeds precision of DAY(2) field

(Note: MONTH AND YEAR also error out but for different reasons ("Only constant window intervals with millisecond resolution are supported"). MONTH and YEAR intervals are not supported at all currently. I was told that it is hard to implement because of timezone differences. I will file that separately.)_
