I used AllWindowedStream<?,GlobalWindow> to process a stream and generate maximum of my window using countWindowAll functions. In this output the size and slide of window works incorrectly.

Refer below example for the bug

Initial stream : 1,2,3,4,5,6.........

Output 1: (Find min for window 10,5) : 1,6,11.....(This is correct)

However if i calculate maximum, I get output as:

Output 2: (Find max for window 10,5) : 5,10,15.... (which is wrong)

Expected: 10,15,20....

 

Please resolve this error.
