The Maven artifact for flink-table bundles its (non-Flink) dependencies to have a self-contained JAR file that can be moved to the ./lib folder without adding additional dependencies.

Currently, we include Apache Calcite, Guava (relocates and required by Calcite), Janino, and Reflections.
Janino and Reflections are not under Apache license, so we need to include their license files into the JAR file.
