This is probably low priority, but I notice that the menu in the left sidebar on the Downloads and the Documentation page bleeds on to content when the page is scrolled down.

The page is responsive for the most part, except when I dock the page left/right on the screen. Notice that the menu isn't collapsed to the right-hand top corner of the page as it should.

My monitor is 24" set to 1920x1080 (native) resolution. I am running Chrome "33.0.1750.117 m" on Windows 8.1.
