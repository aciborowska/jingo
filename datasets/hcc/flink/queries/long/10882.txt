When submitting a job when not enough resources are available currently cuases the job  stay in a CREATE/SCHEDULED state.
There are 2 issues with how this is presented in the UI.

The Running Jobs page incorrectly states that the job is running.
(see list_view attachment)
EDIT: Actually, from a runtime perspective the job is in fact in a RUNNING state.

The state display for individual tasks either

	States the task is in a CREATED state, when it is actually SCHEDULED
	States the task is in a CREATED state, but the count for all state boxes is zero.
(see task_view attachment)
