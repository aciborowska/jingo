Steps to reproduce the problem:

	Start a Kubernetes session cluster, by default, the rest port exposed by the rest Service is 8081.
	Submit a job to the session cluster, but specify a different rest port via -Drest.port=8082.



As we can see, the job could never be submitted to the existing session cluster since we retrieve the port of the Endpoint from the Flink configuration object instead of the created Service.
