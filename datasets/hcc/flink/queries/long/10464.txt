I met a strange question when i use Flink SQL API.

I found two difference type are considered equal.



After debug, i found the hashCode method and equals method in RelRecordType just consider "digest".
 
 But some time, "digest" can not describe a type completely, More information in the "fieldList".
 

“digest” in TimeIndicatorRelDataType should contains time type information(event time or process time).
