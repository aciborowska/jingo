Various tests fail on Windows because the BlobServer attempts to move a file while a FileOutputStream is still open:

BlobServer#putInputStream():


try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(incomingFile)) {
	[ ... use fos ... ]

	// moves file even though fos is still open
	blobKey = moveTempFileToStore(incomingFile, jobId, md.digest(), blobType);

	return blobKey;
} finally {
	...
}
