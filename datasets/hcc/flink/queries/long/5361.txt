The behavior since FLINK-3929 has been to fail if Hadoop security is enabled but a Kerberos credential (or delegation token) isn't available.    It should proceed with a warning that a credential isn't available.

For example, say your shell has a HADOOP_CONF_DIR variable that points to a secure Hadoop installation.   Say you'd like to use Flink for a completely unrelated reason (not involving Hadoop).   The Flink CLI will fail at startup with a message to the effect that a kerberos ticket is needed.   A ticket should not be needed in this scenario.
