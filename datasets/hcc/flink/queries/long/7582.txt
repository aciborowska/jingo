The RestClient uses an executor for sending requests and parsing responses. Under heavy load, i.e. lots of requests being sent, the executor may be used exclusively for sending requests. The responses that are received by the netty threads are thus never parsed and are buffered in memory, until either requests stop coming in or all memory is used up.

We should let the netty receiver thread do the parsing as well.
