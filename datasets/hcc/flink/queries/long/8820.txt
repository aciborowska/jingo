A user reported that the FlinkKafkaConsumer010 very rarely consumes too many bytes, i.e., the returned message is too large. The application is running for about a year and the problem started to occur after upgrading to Flink 1.4.0.

The user made a good effort in debugging the problem but was not able to reproduce it in a controlled environment. It seems that the data is correctly stored in Kafka.

Here's the thread on the thread on the user mailing list for a detailed description of the problem and analysis so far: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/1d62f616d275e9e23a5215ddf7f5466051be7ea96897d827232fcb4e@%3Cuser.flink.apache.org%3E
