FileSystem.listStatus(path) may throw an IOException when it lists files and then retrieves their file status. This is quite common, e.g. editors which create temporary files and move them. The ContinuousFileMonitoringFunction can only apply a file path filter afterwards. Thus, this problem can't easily be avoided and needs to be taken care of by the function itself.
