The Web Client offers to submit a Flink jar first and then run it later. For submitted Jars, the class loader is not stored, only the JobGraph. When submitting the JobGraph for execution, the system class loader is used rather than the appropriate class loader.

Looks like this is a regression of FLINK-2218.
