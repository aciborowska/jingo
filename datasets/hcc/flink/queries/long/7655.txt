Currently, when a FencedRpcEndpoint loses leadership, we set its leader id to a random value. This can be problematic, even though it's unlikely, because we might set it to a value which is used somewhere else (e.g. the currently valid leader id). I think it would  be better to simply set the leader id to null in order to properly encode that the FencedRpcEndpoint is no longer a leader.
