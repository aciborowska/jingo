While testing the RC0 for 1.0.0 I found the following issue:

Setting the number of retries to 0 still leads to the job being restarted:


final StreamExecutionEnvironment see = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
see.setNumberOfExecutionRetries(0);




21:19:50,677 INFO  org.apache.flink.runtime.jobmanager.JobManager                - Status of job 0e78d0825da485167aabee7e63c8e913 (Data Generator) changed to RESTARTING.
21:19:50,678 INFO  org.apache.flink.runtime.executiongraph.restart.FixedDelayRestartStrategy  - Delaying retry of job execution for 10000 ms ...



While looking through the code, it seems that the execution config is returning null when the number of retries is set to 0. With null the jobManager picks the default restart strategy.
