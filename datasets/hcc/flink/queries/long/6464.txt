Currently according to the documentation (https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.2/monitoring/metrics.html) operator metrics constructed using the following pattern:
<operator_name>, <subtask_index>

For some operators, "operator_name" could contain default implementation of toString method. For example:

TriggerWindow(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows(3000), ListStateDescriptor{serializer=org.apache.flink.api.java.typeutils.runtime.kryo.KryoSerializer@c65792d4}, xxx.Trigger@665fe457, WindowedStream.apply(WindowedStream.java:521)) -> Sink: Unnamed



The part "@c65792d4" will be changed every time job is restarted/cancelled. 

As a consequence it's not possible to store metrics for a long time.

Expected:

	ensure all operators return human readable, non-default names OR
	change the way TriggerWindow generates it's name.
