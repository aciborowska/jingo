Once yarn session CLI can't get cluster status, it shuts the cluster down and cleanup related files even if new jobmanger will be created soon. As result, AM restarting will fail due to missing files on HDFS

reproduce step: 
1. start yarn session in interactive mode
2. kill jobmanager process
3. yarn session client can't get cluster status in lookup time and hence trigger shutdown hook which would delete local properties files and files on HDFS, but it can't shutdown the cluster since it can't connect to jobmanager.
