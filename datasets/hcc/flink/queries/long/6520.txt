When the determined offset commit mode is `OffsetCommitMode.ON_CHECKPOINTS`, FlinkKafkaConsumer's need to overwrite whatever setting was set by the user in the config properties to disable automatic offset committing through the Kafka client.

This is properly done in the 0.8 consumer, but not in the 0.9+ consumers.
