Currently SQL client does not show arrays/map in human readable way (please have a look at examples below). e.g. 

select map[1,2];

 is shown as 

 +/-                    EXPR$0
   +         java.util.HashMap



select array[1,2];

 is shown as 

+/-                    EXPR$0
   +       java.lang.Integer[]


 

select array[map[1,2],map[2,2]];

 is shown as 

 +/-                    EXPR$0
   +           java.util.Map[]


select map[array[1,2], array[1,2]];

 is shown as 

 +/-                    EXPR$0
   +         java.util.HashMap
