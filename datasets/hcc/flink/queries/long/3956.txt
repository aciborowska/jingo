Currently many input file input formats rely on a user specified Configuration object for their correct configuration. As an example, the DelimitedInputFormat can take its delimiter character from this object. 

This is happening for legacy reasons, and does not work in the streaming codebase. In streaming, the user-specified configuration object is over-written at the TaskManagers by a new Configuration object.

This issue aims at solving this by refactoring current file input formats to be 
able to set their parameters through setters.
