When using bin/start-cluster.sh to start TaskManagers and a worker node is failing to start because of missing memory, you do not receive any error messages in log files.

Worker node has only 15000M memory available, but it is configured with Maximum heap size: 40000 MiBytes. Task manager does not join the cluster. Process hangs.

Last lines of log looks like this:
...
... - - Starting with 12 incoming and 12 outgoing connection threads.
... - Setting low water mark to 16384 and high water mark to 32768 bytes.
... - Instantiated PooledByteBufAllocator with direct arenas: 24, heap arenas: 0, page size (bytes): 65536, chunk size (bytes): 16777216.
... - Using 0.7 of the free heap space for managed memory.
... - Initializing memory manager with 24447 megabytes of memory. Page size is 32768 bytes.
(END)

Error message about not enough memory is missing.
