Fix Filesystem options:

	Throws unsupported exception when using metastore commit policy for filesystem table, Filesystem connector has an empty implementation in �TableMetaStoreFactory. We should avoid user configuring this policy.
	Default value of "sink.partition-commit.trigger" should be "process-time". Users are hard to figure out what is wrong when they don't have watermark. We can set "sink.partition-commit.trigger" to "process-time" to have better out-of-box experience.
	The type of "sink.rolling-policy.file-size" should be MemoryType.
