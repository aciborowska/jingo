When Non-windowed group-aggregate using minIdleStateRetentionTime config and retract AGG, Will emit "NULL" agg value which we do not expect. 
For example: (IntSumWithRetractAggFunction)
1. Receive: CRow(Row.of(6L: JLong, 5: JInt, "aaa"), true) 
2. Cleanup state
3. Receive: CRow(Row.of(6L: JLong, 5: JInt, "aaa"), false)  // acc.f1 = -1, getValue= null 

So, we must change the logic of GroupAggProcessFunction as follows:

if (inputCnt != 0) {
     ...
    } else {
     ...
    }


TO

if (inputCnt > 0) {
     ...
    } else {
    if( null != prevRow.row){
     ...
     }
    }


In this case, the result will bigger than expected, but i think it's make sense, because user want cleanup state.(they should know the impact)
