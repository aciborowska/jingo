Normally, the exception is thrown when the consumer uses the same shard iterator after 5 minutes since it was retrieved. I've still yet to clarify & reproduce the root cause of the ExpiredIteratorException, because from the code this seems to be impossible. I'm leaning towards suspecting this is a Kinesis-side issue (from the description in the ML, the behaviour also seems indeterminate).

Either way, the exception can be fairly easily handled so that the consumer doesn't just fail. When caught, we request a new shard iterator from Kinesis with the last sequence number.
