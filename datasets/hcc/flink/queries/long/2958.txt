In StreamingJobGraphGenerator:


	private void configureExecutionRetries() {
		int executionRetries = streamGraph.getExecutionConfig().getNumberOfExecutionRetries();
		if (executionRetries != -1) {
			jobGraph.setNumberOfExecutionRetries(executionRetries);
		} else {
			// if the user didn't configure anything, the number of retries is 0.
			jobGraph.setNumberOfExecutionRetries(0);
		}
	}



This results in the default cluster-wide configuration to be ignored.
