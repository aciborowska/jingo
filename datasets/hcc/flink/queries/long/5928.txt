I noticed that PR #3346 accidentally broke externalized checkpoints by using a fixed meta data file name. We should restore the old behaviour with creating random files and double check why no test caught this.

This will likely superseded by upcoming changes from [~StephanEwen] to use metadata streams on the JobManager.
