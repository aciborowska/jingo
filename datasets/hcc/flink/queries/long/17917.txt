Background: In FLINK-17390, we leverage WorkerSpecContainerResourceAdapter.InternalContainerResource to handle container matching logic. In FLINK-17407, we introduce external resources in WorkerSpecContainerResourceAdapter.InternalContainerResource.
 On containers returned by Yarn, we try to get the corresponding worker specs by:

	Convert the container to InternalContainerResource
	Get the WorkerResourceSpec from containerResourceToWorkerSpecs map.



Problem: Container mismatch could happen in the below scenario:

	Flink does not allocate any external resources, the externalResources of InternalContainerResource is an empty map.
	The returned container contains all the resources (with a value of 0) defined in Yarn's resource-types.xml. The externalResources of InternalContainerResource has one or more entries with a value of 0.
	These two InternalContainerResource do not match.



To solve this problem, we could ignore all the external resources with a value of 0 in "ResourceInformationReflector#getExternalResources".
