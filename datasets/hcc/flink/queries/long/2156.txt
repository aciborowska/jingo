The Scala only modules flink-scala-shell and flink-ml use Maven's scalatest plugin to run their tests. The scalatest plugin has no forkNumber, though. Therefore, the logging fails to create the logging file as specified in the log4j-travis.properties file.

We can fix this issue by giving these two modules different log4j.properties files which don't require a forkNumber. Or we fix the forkNumber to 1.
