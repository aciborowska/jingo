For debugging purposes we tell all JVMs on CI to create a heap dump if they hit an OOM.
We additionally collect the .dumpstream files from surefire, which contain the raw JVM output.

All JVMs will log something like this:


# Created at 2020-06-16T14:30:35.624
Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError



This is fine, and cannot be avoided, but as a result you have a lot of .dumpstream files that only contain this entry, which is a bit annoying when looking for that one file that actually contains the important entries.
Maybe we could filter out files that only contain these entries.
