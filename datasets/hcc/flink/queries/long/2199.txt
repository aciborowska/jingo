Building Flink with skipped tests (
{mvn -DskipTests clean install}
) fails with Scala checkstyle violations (line length limit exceeded) in 
{flink-scala-shell}
 
{FlinkILoop}
. The problem is caused be the special characters used for the squirrel logo in lines 148 to 179. Windows seems to interpret these characters as multi-chars causing too long lines.
