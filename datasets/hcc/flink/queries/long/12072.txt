Failing to capture the metrics for AsyncIO - ordered or unorderd wait using statsdreporter

Reason is Operator name is "async wait operator" & metric names get truncated at the whitespace, resulting in an unexpected behavior

Sample Metric : <job_id>.async_io_test.async wait operator.0.numRecordsIn:0|g

tested with Telegraf influx plugin, with influx sink.
