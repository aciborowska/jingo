The Apache Flink documentation details that users may change the default scope of metrics emitted by using a scope format. 

Changing the scope format allows end users to store metrics with lower cardinality while introducing the drawback of being unable to differentiate between metrics from different tasks/operators/etc sharing the same name. 

With the Prometheus reporter, regardless of the scope format used, every variable is always emitted. 

Would it be reasonable for the Prometheus reporter to respect the scope format and only emit dimensions that are in scope?
