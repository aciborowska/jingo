I apologize in advance if this is a silly newbie mistake.

I am trying to build Flink on macOS 10.13, and I can't get the basic `mvn clean` target to succeed. (`mvn package` also errors out, but I'm trying to just get the basic `mvn clean` working before I attack that.) It throws several warnings bout expressions in artifactIds, and then errors out with this error:

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project flink-dist_2.11: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.apache.flink:flink-dist_2.11:jar:1.6-SNAPSHOT: Failure to find org.apache.flink:flink-shaded-hadoop2-uber:jar:1.6-SNAPSHOT in https://repository.apache.org/snapshots was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of apache.snapshots has elapsed or updates are forced -> [Help 1]

To reproduce:

I'm simply cloning my fork of the flink repo, cding in to it, and immediately doing a `mvn clean`. Same thing happens if I check out the `release-1.5.0` tag first.

I've attached the output of the build as `mvn-clean.out`, since it's quite long.
