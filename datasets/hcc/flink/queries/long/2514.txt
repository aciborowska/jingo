The following code behaves differently on the LocalStreamEnvironment and the RemoteStreamEnvironment.


StreamExecutionEnvironment env = ...;

env.addSource(someSource).addSink(someSink);
env.execute();

env.addSource(anotherSource).addSink(anotherSink);
env.execute();



Locally, only the second source/sink pair is executed.
Remotely, both are re-executed.
