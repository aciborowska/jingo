Submitting a job via

bin/flink run -m yarn-cluster ...


and terminating the client can lead to lingering YARN sessions allocating cluster resources.

This was reported by a user.


1) One starts a flink job in the yarn mode
2) He sees that containers are not allocated since cluster is busy
3) Presses Ctrl+C
4) An “empty” flink session remains in the cluster although the Flink didn’t print that “you can track your application on the X URL”
