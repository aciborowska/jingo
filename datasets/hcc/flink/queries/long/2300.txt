On the Flink website, the links using the "github" plugin are broken.

For example

{% github README.md master "build instructions" %}


renders to

https://github.com/apache/flink/tree/master/README.md


See:
http://flink.apache.org/faq.html#my-job-fails-early-with-a-javaioeofexception-what-could-be-the-cause

I was not able to resolve the issue by using <a> tags or markdown links.
