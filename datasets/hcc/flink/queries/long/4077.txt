Registering a Pojo DataSet / DataStream as Table requires alias expressions and does not work with simple field references. However, alias expressions would only be necessary if the fields of the Pojo should be renamed. 


DataStream<Person> persons = ...

// DOES NOT WORK
tEnv.registerDataStream(
  "Persons", 
  persons, 
  "name, age, address");

// DOES WORK
tEnv.registerDataStream(
  "Persons", 
  persons, 
  "name AS name, age AS age, address AS address");



We should also allow simple field name references in addition to alias expressions to rename fields.
