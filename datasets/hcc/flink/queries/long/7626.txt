I export the metrics to the logfile via Slf4jReporter(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-4831), and found that there are some checkpoint metrics that are not described in the document, so I added.



//Number of total checkpoints (in progress, completed, failed)
totalNumberOfCheckpoints

 //Number of in progress checkpoints.
numberOfInProgressCheckpoints

//Number of successfully completed checkpoints
numberOfCompletedCheckpoints

//Number of failed checkpoints.
numberOfFailedCheckpoints

//Timestamp when the checkpoint was restored at the coordinator.
lastCheckpointRestoreTimestamp

//Buffered bytes during alignment over all subtasks.
lastCheckpointAlignmentBuffered
