Hello,

In method open in JDBCInputFormat.java, while using dbConn.createStatement, the resultSetType & resultSetConcurrency are hardcoded. 
These two fields may vary with different JDBC drivers & hence it fails in a few cases like SAP HANA Jdbc driver. 
There are two variants of the method dbCon.createStatement, one with parameters & the other without  parameters. Both should be supported. 

Thanks & regards,
Subhobrata
