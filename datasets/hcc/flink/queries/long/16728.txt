At some point I noticed that a few jobs got stuck (they basically stopped processing the messages, I could detect this watching the expected output), so I tried to cancel them.

The cancel operation failed, complaining that the job got stuck atÂ 

StreamTaskActionExecutor$SynchronizedStreamTaskActionExecutor.run(StreamTaskActionExecutor.java:86)

and then the whole taskmanager shut down.

See the attached log.

This is actually happening practically every day in our staging environment where we are testing Flink 1.10.0.
