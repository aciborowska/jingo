After adding the logic to bookkeeping the resource used in the shared slots, the resource requests will be recorded inside the MultiTaskSlot and when the underlying slot is allocated, all the resource requests will be checked if there is over-subscription, if so, some requests will be failed.

In the current implementation, the code does not check the amount to fail before printing the over-allocated debug log and tries to fail them. This should not cause actual errors, but it will 

	Print a debug log saying some requests will be failed even if no one to fail.
	If the total number of requests is 0 (This is possible if there already AllocatedSlot before the first request), the release method will be called. Although it will do nothing with the current implementation (the slot is still being created and not added to any other data structure), it may cause error if the release logic changes in the future.



To fix this issue, we should add a explicit check on the number of requests to fail.
