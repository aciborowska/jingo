Currently on Yarn setups, we are passing task executor specific configurations through dynamic properties in the starting command (see FLINK-13184).

If the value of configuration contains space, the dynamic properties may not be correctly parsed, which could cause task executor failures. On occurrence can be found in FLINK-15047.

It would be good to allow spaces when passing dynamic properties. E.g., surrounding the values with double quotation marks, or escaping special characters.
