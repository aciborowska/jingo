There are some bugs and typos in the memory related source code. For example,

	In MemoryManager.release method, it should throw an NPE, if the input is null. But it does not.Â 
	In HybridMemorySegment.put and get methods, the number of bytes read/written should be specified by the input parameter, rather than reading/writing until the end.
	In HeapMemorySegment, the data member memory should be returned. This is because the member heapArray will not be reset to null after calling the release method.
