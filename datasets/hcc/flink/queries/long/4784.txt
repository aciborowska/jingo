The name of the MetricQueryService actor is currently fixed, which can lead to collisions if multiple TaskManagers run in the same actor system, as is the case for the MiniCluster.

We can append the TaskManager ResourceID to make the name unique for every TaskManager. The MetricFetcher would still be able to reliable infer the correct actor name.
