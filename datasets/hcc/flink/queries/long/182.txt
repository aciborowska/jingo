Introduced by https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/pull/163

I'm running a fresh ubuntu 13.04 ([advertisement]from our new demo-vms: https://github.com/rmetzger/stratosphere-vms [/advertisement])

```./start-local.sh 
/home/vagrant/stratosphere/bin/../bin/nephele-jobmanager.sh: line 34: bc: command not found
```

I hope there are other ways in bash to add two numbers
