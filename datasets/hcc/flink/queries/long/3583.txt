Hello.
I can see that configuration is not visible in frontend when job is running.

When I cancel job, configuration appears but `User configuration` is still not visible, although server sends `user-config`.

rest-call: http://localhost:8081/jobs/jobId/config returns

{
    "jid": "71e47c0772c7d62b81f7e3385d429cca",
    "name": "Flink Streaming Job",
    "execution-config": {
        "execution-mode": "PIPELINED",
        "restart-strategy": "Restart with fixed delay (5000 ms). #3 restart attempts.",
        "job-parallelism": 1,
        "object-reuse-mode": false,
        "user-config": {
            "jobmanager.web.log.path": "./data/dummyLogFile.txt",
            "local.start-webserver": "true"
        }
    }
}



So there are two problems:
1. User cannot see configuration when job is running which is not really useful
I can see that it happens because of

ExecutionConfig ec = graph.getExecutionConfig();
if (ec != null) { ... }


 in JobConfigHandler. Why executionConfig is marked as "// ------ Fields that are only relevant for archived execution graphs ------------" and can it be initialized earlier let's say in ExecutionGraph constructor?

2. Even when configuration is visible, frontent probably parses it badly
This should be simple to fix

I'm happy to implement both fixes if you don't mind
