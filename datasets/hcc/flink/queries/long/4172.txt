Some graph algorithms pass through a DataSet unmodified (at least, until we have VertexSet and EdgeSet). We need to prevent a DataSet from being proxied twice. Allowing two methods to own a single object sounds brittle, so we can instead provide access to the original DataSet which can be wrapped in a new proxy.
