Currently there is no way to provide a custom configuration upon creation of a remote environment (via ExecutionEnvironment.createRemoteEnvironment(...)).

This leads to errors when the submitted job exceeds the default value for the max. payload size in Akka, as we can not increase the configuration value (akka.remote.OversizedPayloadException: Discarding oversized payload...)

Providing an overloaded method with a configuration parameter for the remote environment fixes that.
