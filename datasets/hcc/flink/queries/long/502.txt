I just learned about Stratoshpere from Volker Markl. I am very impressed by the little I have read so far about the system and am eager to try it out. 

I attempted to download the VM image from the Downloads page (http://stratosphere.eu/downloads/), but that process errs out after spinning for 20 seconds or so. I imagine there is a time out. Given that I just downloaded a 100MB VirtualBox installer package in under 30 seconds over my 50 Mbps connection, I am guessing the time out is on the server side.

Would someone please take a look at this issue? Perhaps there is a problem on my side?
