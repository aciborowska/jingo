Hi Team,

Here is, what we are looking for:

	We have  flink HA dockerized cluster with (3 zookeepers, 2 job-managers, 3 task-managers).
	We are using HDFS from the flink to store some data. The problem we are facing is that, we are not able to pass 2 name-node IPs in config. 
	These are the config parameters we want to add two name-node IPs




	      "state.checkpoints.dir: hdfs://X.X.X.X:9001/flinkdatastorage"
	      "state.backend.fs.checkpointdir: hdfs://X.X.X.X:9001/flinkdatastorage"
	      "high-availability.zookeeper.storageDir: hdfs://X.X.X.X:9001/flink/recovery"



Currently we are passing only one name-node IP

Please advise. 

I have attached the sample docker-entrypoint.sh file:
