ATTENTION: This is a issue about building pyflink, not development.

During we build pyflink...

After we have built flink from flink source code, a folder named "target" is generated.

Then, following the document description, "cd flink-python; python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel", error happens.

Root cause: in the setup.py file, line 75, "FLINK_HOME = os.path.abspath("../build-target")", the program can't found folder "build-target", however, the building of flink generated a folder named "target". So error happens in this way...

Â 

The right way:

in ../flink-python/setup.py line 75, modify code as following:

FLINK_HOME = os.path.abspath("../target")
