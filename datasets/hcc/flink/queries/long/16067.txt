The parser used to parse SQL queries submitted through TableEnvironmentImpl.sqlUpdate does not add the original exception from Calcite as a cause to Flink's org.apache.flink.table.api.SqlParserException. 

However, Calcite's exception contains the position in the SQL query where the parser failed.
This info would help users to fix their queries.

This used to work with Flink 1.9.x.
