It says "type is not composite (but is) and goes on talking about POJO types." I think that should be fixed.


Type GenericType<flink.tutorial.pagerank.PageRank.Page> is not a composite type. Key expressions are only supported on POJO types and Tuples. A type is considered a POJO if all its fields are public, or have both getters and setters defined
