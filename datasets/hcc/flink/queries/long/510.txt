The virtual machines are currently deployed without a proper Stratosphere installation (the source is present, but there is no binary build).
The also has to be a README file or so that explains the first steps.


I would suggest to install a minimal GUI, a web-browser with some bookmarks to the Stratosphere webinterface.
