Now in hive HadoopFileSystemFactory, we use org.apache.flink.runtime.fs.hdfs.HadoopFileSystem to get FileSystem.

But it should not work after we setting default child first class loader. Because in standalone mode, the cluster has no hadoop dependency. So the solution is:

	Add `flink-hadoop-fs` dependency to hive module, not work, because classes with "org.apache.flink" prefix will always be loaded by parent class loader 
	User add hadoop dependency to standalone cluster, it breaks out-of-the-box.
	Shade hadoop FileSystem in hive module, not complex, good.
