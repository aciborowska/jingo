Scala's TypeAnalyzer does not consider the ResultTypeQueryable interface. This means that type information that has been specified manually is ignored in many cases.

For example:


val myConsumer: FlinkKafkaConsumer010[Row] = new FlinkKafkaConsumer010(topics, new MyDeserializationSchema(jsonSchema), properties)
 val inputStream: DataStream[Row] = env.addSource(myConsumer)



The row type is always generic even though a type information has been specified in the DeserializationSchema.
