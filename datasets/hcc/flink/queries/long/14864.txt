The documentation specifies that you should provide a parameter called `programArg`.

Repro

Send JSON as a POST body to /jars/:jarid/run with `programArg` as a parameter

Expected

Successfully starts the job passing in the values from `programArg`

Actual

**Returns error:

```

{"errors":["Request did not match expected format JarRunRequestBody."]}

```

 

Digging into the source code, it appears that JarRunRequestBody expects the field to be plural: `programArgs`

https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-runtime-web/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/webmonitor/handlers/JarRequestBody.java#L44

 

Changing the name of the parameter to `programArgs` results in the job being successfully submitted with no error.
