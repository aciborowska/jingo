 I am using IntervalJoin function to join two streams within 10 minutes. As below:

 
 labelStream.intervalJoin(adLogStream)
                         .between(Time.milliseconds(0), Time.milliseconds(600000)) 
            .process(new processFunction())
            .sink(kafkaProducer)
 labelStream and adLogStream are proto-buf class that are keyed by Long id.

Our two input-streams are huge. After running about 30minutes, the output to kafka go down slowly, like this: 



When data output begins going down, I use jstack and pstack sevaral times to get these: 





It seems the program is stucked in rockdb's seek. And I find that some rockdb's srt file are accessed slowly by iteration. 

I have tried several ways:

1)Reduce the input amount to half. This works well.

2)Replace labelStream and adLogStream with simple Strings. This way, data amount will not change. This works well.}}

3)Use PredefinedOptions like SPINNING_DISK_OPTIMIZED and SPINNING_DISK_OPTIMIZED_HIGH_MEM. This still fails.}}

4)Use new versions of rocksdbjni. This still fails.}}

Can anyone give me some suggestions? Thank you very much.
