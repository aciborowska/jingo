I recently upgraded from 1.2.0 and savepoint creration behaves strange. Whenever I try to create a savepoint with specified directory Apache Flink creates a folder on the active JobManager (even if I trigger savepoint creation from a different JobManager) which contains only _metadata. And another folder on the TaskManager where the job is running which contains the actual savepoint.
Obviously if I try to restore it says it can't find the savepoint.
This worked in 1.2.0.
