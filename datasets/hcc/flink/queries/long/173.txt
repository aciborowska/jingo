We need to catch programs consisting of multiple disjoint data flows in the pact layer to produce a meaningful message. Otherwise the JobManager will throw a GraphConversionException at runtime, stating that the job graph is not weakly connected.

Below is are two  simple example for such a program. The first is caught by the current logic, the second is not caught in general (depends on order in which sinks are added, as that determines the way in which this graph is augmented with auxiliary nodes until it has a single root node.

        (SRC A)             (SRC B)
