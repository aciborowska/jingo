Currently we added `Cleanup State` feature. But It not work well if we enabled the stateCleaning on Unbounded ProcTime NonPartitioned Over window, Because in `ProcessFunctionWithCleanupState` we has using the keyed state.

So, In this JIRA. I'll change the  `Unbounded ProcTime NonPartitioned Over` to `partitioned Over` by using NullByteKeySelector. OR created a `NonKeyedProcessFunctionWithCleanupState`. But I think the first way is simpler. What do you think? Fabian Hueske
