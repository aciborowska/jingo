A user on the mailing list ran into the problem that the directMemorySize was incorrectly set too high which may happen if the following code path gets maxMemory from 1/4*<physical mem size>> instead of the calculation, taskmanager.sh is doing (in his case via the discouraged start-local.sh script).

Other code paths may also exhibit this issue, which should be checked.

TaskManagerServices#createMemoryManager()
} else if (memType == MemoryType.OFF_HEAP) {
	// The maximum heap memory has been adjusted according to the fraction
	long maxMemory = EnvironmentInformation.getMaxJvmHeapMemory();
	long directMemorySize = (long) (maxMemory / (1.0 - memoryFraction) * memoryFraction);
	if (preAllocateMemory) {
		LOG.info("Using {} of the maximum memory size for managed off-heap memory ({} MB)." ,
			memoryFraction, directMemorySize >> 20);
	} else {
		LOG.info("Limiting managed memory to {} of the maximum memory size ({} MB)," +
			" memory will be allocated lazily.", memoryFraction, directMemorySize >> 20);
	}
	memorySize = directMemorySize;
} else {
