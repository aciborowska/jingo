With Flink 1.5.0 we introduced local recovery. In order to make local recovery work we had to change the scheduling to be aware of the previous location of the Execution. This scheduling strategy is also active if local recovery is deactivated. I suggest to also disable the scheduling strategy if local recovery is not enabled.
