Travis build fails on the flink-tachyon module with the following error message:
Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.17:test (default-test) on project flink-tachyon: ExecutionException: java.lang.RuntimeException: The forked VM terminated without properly saying goodbye. VM crash or System.exit called?

This apparently doesn't seem to be an issue with flink but we can track on this ticket if it gets fixed elsewhere.
