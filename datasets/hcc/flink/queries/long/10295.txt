We were upgrading from Flink 1.4 to 1.6. At present we have a jar which takes all the details to run the job as program args against a jarid, including sql query and kafka details. In version 1.5 the program args are tokenised as a result single quote (') and double quote(") are stripped from the arguments. This results in malformed args.

Attached a sample request for reference.
