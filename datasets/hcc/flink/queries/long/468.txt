I hacked together a little utility Stratosphere job that generates input data for wordcount. I wanted to have this to demonstrate Stratosphere with a few TB of input data on an Amazon AWS cloud.

Its not sophisticated at all, uses the same seed for all data sources and the generated strings are equally random distributed, not zipf or so. (So its not very good for a Wordcount-benchmark).

I also changed the current word count to generate some (really small) input data. It generates data automatically if the user did not specify any arguments. BUT: Our Wordcount now runs out of the box!
