ZooKeeper based high availability tools like ZooKeeperLeaderRetrievalService and ZooKeeperLeaderElectionService expect that every instance of the services have a dedicated CuratorFramework instance assigned. Thus, they also close this CuratorFramework when the service is closed. This does not play well along with the newly introduced HighAvailabilityServices which caches a single CuratorFramework and shares it among all created services. In order to make it work properly together I propose to change the behaviour such that we no longer close the CuratorFramework clients in the ZooKeeper based services.
