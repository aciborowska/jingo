This case should be fail because three KeyGroupStateHandles which have same  KeyGroupRange[0,0] are received by 'CheckpointCoordinator'.

1. In this case these ‘statefulExec’s should use three different KeyGroupRanges such as [0,0],[1,1],[2,2].

2. Add another test case which can verify 'CheckpointCoordiantor' throws a exception when receive overlapped KeyGroupRange.
