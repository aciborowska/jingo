The heartbeatTimeoutIntervalMs of HeartbeatMonitor should be larger than 0, currently the arg check looks like


Preconditions.checkArgument(heartbeatTimeoutIntervalMs >= 0L, "The heartbeat timeout interval has to be larger than 0.");



it should be


Preconditions.checkArgument(heartbeatTimeoutIntervalMs > 0L, "The heartbeat timeout interval has to be larger than 0.");
