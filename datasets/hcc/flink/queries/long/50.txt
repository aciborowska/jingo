So this is the initial version of HBase for ozone.
Sample code how to read from HBase is provided in pact-examples

I merged this with dimalabs:master.
The relevant commits are 33d6a1a and 39664be
The all previous commits are from the cloudera support branch, everything after those two is the result of merging.

Get back to me if this is too messy, I could also just copy/paste the HBase stuff into a fresh branch.
The current diff to dimalabs:master looks find to me, though.
