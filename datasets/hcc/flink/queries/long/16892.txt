Because the "provided" scope in Maven does not work well with transitive dependencies, many transitive dependencies are interpreted as "compile" scope and included in the shaded jar.

Currently only "flink-runtime" and "flink-streaming-java" are overridden as provided in "statefun-flink-distribution". We need to add all Flink other dependent Flink modules directly as provided.
