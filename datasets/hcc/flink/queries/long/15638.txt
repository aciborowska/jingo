releasing/create_release_branch.sh does not set the version in flink-python/pyflink/version.py. Currently the version.py contains:


__version__ = "1.10.dev0" 



setup.py will replace .dev0 with -SNAPSHOT and tries to find the respective flink distribution in the flink-dist/target, which will not exist.
