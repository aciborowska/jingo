The new REST API POST endpoint, /jobs/:jobid/savepoints, returns an error unless the request includes a body with all parameters (target-directory and cancel-job)), even thought the documentation suggests these are optional.

If a POST request with no data is made, the response is a 400 status code with the error message "Bad request received."

If the POST request submits an empty JSON object ( {} ), the response is a 400 status code with the error message "Request did not match expected format SavepointTriggerRequestBody."  The same is true if only the target-directory or cancel-job parameters are included.

As the system is configured with a default savepoint location, there shouldn't be a need to include the parameter in the quest.
