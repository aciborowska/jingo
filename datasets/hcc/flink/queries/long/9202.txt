The AvroSerializer contains this field which is written when the serializer is written into savepoints:
https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/be7c89596a3b9cd8805a90aaf32336ec2759a1f7/flink-formats/flink-avro/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/formats/avro/typeutils/AvroSerializer.java#L78

This causes Avro schema evolution to not work properly, because Avro generated classes have non-fixed serialVersionUIDs. Once a new Avro class is generated with a new schema, that class can not be loaded on restore due to incompatible UIDs, and thus the serializer can not be successfully deserialized.

A possible solution would be to only write the classname, and dynamically load the class into a transient field.
