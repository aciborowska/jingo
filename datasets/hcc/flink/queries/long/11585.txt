There are some cases where the key-prefix matching does not work as intended:


	given the prefixes "a.b" and "a.b.c.d", then an option with a key "a.b.c.X" will be assigned to the default groups instead of "a.b"
	given a prefix "a.b", an option "a.c.b" will be matched to that group instead of the default
