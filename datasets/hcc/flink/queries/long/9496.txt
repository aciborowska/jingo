It seems the "start-time" reported by monitoring API under joboverview ++ is reset after a restart.

Also, it seems the "start-time" & "timestamps" under job details are also reset when a job is restarted. I expected the "CREATED" date under "timestamps" to be initial created time of the job but it is reset after a job is restarted.

Probably good to check if the metrics stored in history server has the same issue.
