I started writing the integration tests for the aggregate operator and have some trouble with my first example:

```	
DataSet<Tuple3<Integer, Long, String>> ds = CollectionDataSets.get3TupleDataSet(env);			
DataSet<Tuple2<Integer, Long>> aggregateDs = ds
						.aggregate(Aggregations.SUM, 0)
						.aggregate(Aggregations.MAX, 1);
````

What I expect is the SUM and MAX of all fields. I get always the correct sum but for the MAX the result is changing, sometimes producing 4 or 5 instead of the correct 6.
Has somebody an idea where the problem could lie?
