This will fail to work with dependencies described in (https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.5/ops/deployment/aws.html)

 

"Depending on which file system you use, please add the following dependencies. You can find these as part of the Hadoop binaries in hadoop-2.7/share/hadoop/tools/lib:

	S3AFileSystem:
	
		hadoop-aws-2.7.3.jar
		aws-java-sdk-s3-1.11.183.jar and its dependencies:
		
			aws-java-sdk-core-1.11.183.jar
			aws-java-sdk-kms-1.11.183.jar
			jackson-annotations-2.6.7.jar
			jackson-core-2.6.7.jar
			jackson-databind-2.6.7.jar
			joda-time-2.8.1.jar
			httpcore-4.4.4.jar
