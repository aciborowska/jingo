When running session cluster, flink uses jobmanager.rpc.address from config file or command line arguments. However, when deploying session cluster on mesos in high availability mode, we need toÂ run entry point in scheduling systems such as marathon, in which case we can't assign hostname to jobmanager.rpc.address or rest.address, so we need to use hostname as default value.
