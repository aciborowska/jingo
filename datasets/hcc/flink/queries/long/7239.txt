The streaming table operators for group-window and over-window aggregates do only support append-only input, i.e., no updates.

However, the DataStreamGroupWindowAggregate DataStreamOverAggregate RelNodes do only check that the input does not have retraction messages which is only one possible encoding of updates.

We should fix the RelNodes to check if the input is append-only using the UpdatingPlanChecker similar to DataStreamWindowJoin.
