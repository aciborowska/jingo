I had an issue where the state in my rolling window was incorrectly being maintained from window to window.  

The initial state of my window looked like this:

Map[Key, MutableValue] = {("A", Value(0)}, ("B", Value(0)}



Then in Window 0 I update the state so it looks like this at the close of the window:

Map[Key, MutableValue] = {("A", Value(1)}, ("B", Value(3)}



Then at the start of Window 1 the state looks like it did at the end of Window 0:

Map[Key, MutableValue] = {("A", Value(1)}, ("B", Value(3)}


when I expected it to look like the initial state:

Map[Key, MutableValue] = {("A", Value(0)}, ("B", Value(0)}



It looks like TraversableSerializer is doing a shallow copy of the elements in the traversable instead of a deep copy
