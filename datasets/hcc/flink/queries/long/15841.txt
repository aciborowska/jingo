The TimeWindow JavaDoc explains that the start index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive, therefore two windows T0 to T1 and T1 to T2 are next to each other without overlapping.

To fix this the intersects comparison should be changed to: this.start < other.end && this.end > other.start

Also a test should be added to verify the methods works correctly.
