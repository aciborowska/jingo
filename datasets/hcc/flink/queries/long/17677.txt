The Application Profiling & Debugging documentation recommend to use the script variable FLINK_LOG_PREFIX for defining log file paths. However, this variable is only available in standalone mode. This is a bit misleading for users of other deployments (see this thread).

I propose to replace FLINK_LOG_PREFIX with a general representation <your-log-path>, and add a separate section to discuss how to set the log path (e.g., use FLINK_LOG_PREFIX with standalone deployments and <LOG_DIR> with Yarn deployments).
