Suppose I have a table with a DATE partition column. The following DML would fail:

Flink SQL> insert into foo partition (p1=date '2020-01-24') select ..., ...;
[INFO] Submitting SQL update statement to the cluster...
[ERROR] Could not execute SQL statement. Reason:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: not a literal: DATE '2020-01-24'



Not sure why DATE '2020-01-24' is not considered a literal. And changing it to a CAST doesn't work either:

Flink SQL> insert into foo partition (p1=cast('2020-01-24' as date)) select ...,...;
[INFO] Submitting SQL update statement to the cluster...
[ERROR] Could not execute SQL statement. Reason:
org.apache.flink.table.api.SqlParserException: SQL parse failed. Encountered "cast" at line 1, column 35.
Was expecting one of:
    "DATE" ...
    "FALSE" ...
    "INTERVAL" ...
    "NULL" ...
    "TIME" ...
    "TIMESTAMP" ...
    "TRUE" ...
    "UNKNOWN" ...
    <UNSIGNED_INTEGER_LITERAL> ...
    <APPROX_NUMERIC_LITERAL> ...
    <DECIMAL_NUMERIC_LITERAL> ...
    <BINARY_STRING_LITERAL> ...
    <QUOTED_STRING> ...
    <PREFIXED_STRING_LITERAL> ...
    <UNICODE_STRING_LITERAL> ...
    <LBRACE_D> ...
    <LBRACE_T> ...
    <LBRACE_TS> ...
    "+" ...
    "-" ...
