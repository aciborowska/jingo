The SlotPool releases idling slots. If the release operation fails (e.g. timeout), then it simply continues using the slot. This is problematic if the owning TaskExecutor failed before and was unregistered in the meantime from the SlotPool. As a result, the SlotPool will reuse the slot and whenever it tries to return because it is idling it will fail again. This, effectively, renders the scheduling of a job impossible.
