./bin/yarn-session.sh -n 4 -jm 1024m -tm 4096m

I want to boot up a Yarn Session Cluster use the command above

but Flink doesn't create the task executors but only the applicationMaster(YarnSessionClusterEntryPoint)

 

the Task Executors will be created when a job was submitted.

 

the point is that Yarn ResourceManager doesn't know how many task executors should be created because the -n option was not accept by ResourceMananger
