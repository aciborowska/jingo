The tests in flink-tests are currently executed on Travis with fork parallelism of 2. It seems that the memory requirements for certain tests have become so high, that certain combinations for two tests in parallel can exceed the available resources on the containerized Travis build infrastructure, triggering the OOM Killer.

I think that we can reduce the fork parallelism to 1 for our Travis builds. Tests seem to execute at comparable speed as before without running into resource problems.
