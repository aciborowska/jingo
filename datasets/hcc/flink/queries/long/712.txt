I tried to write a test for combinable cogroup (see  (#548 | FLINK-548)). I extended the new API to set the correct flag for combinableFirst/Seconed so that it is correctly passed to the optimizer, but the combine methods are not called. I tried to right click in eclipse and "open call hierarchy" on the combine methods (usually that gives me the place where the method is called) but it stayed empty. Is there runtime support von combineFirst/Second on cogroup? If yes, in what driver are the combine methods called? 
I do not find any example where combineFirst/Second are used. I tested it with the CoGroupConnectedComponentsITCase and set a breakpoint inside the combineFirst but it is not called.
