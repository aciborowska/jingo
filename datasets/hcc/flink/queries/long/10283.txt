When running any job the FileCache will log the following warning:



improper use of releaseJob() without a matching number of createTmpFiles() calls for jobId 7d288909946d5eb4c8d40616ad1b20d2



This warning is misleading as createTmpFiles is only called when the DistributedCache was used, but releaseJob is always called as part of the task cleanup routine.
The warning should simply be removed.
