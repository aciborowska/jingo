There are two ways to stop yarn session described in yarn_setup document:

Stop the YARN session by stopping the unix process (using CTRL+C) or by entering ‘stop’ into the client.


But in fact, yarn session application still can run after stopping the unix process (using CTRL+C).
We can either update the yarn_setup document to remove this incorrect way or add ShutdownHook to stop yarn session in FlinkYarnSessionCli to make it correct.
Looking forward to the feedbacks and would like to work on this ticket. Thanks.
