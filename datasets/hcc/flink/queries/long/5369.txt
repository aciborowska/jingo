Currently, every project in Flink has a hard (compile scope) dependency on the jsr305, slf4j, log4j, and commons-land3 artifacts, because these dependencies are declared in the root pom.xml. That way they are pulled into every fat jar, including user fat jars as soon as they refer to a connector or library.

We should get the log4j related dependencies out of the root pom file. Ideally these dependencies are only in test scope (as the default logger for testing) and in flink-dist and the quickstart poms. But to keep compatibility with the current project setups by users, we could also add them to flink-core.

In addition, the projects whose artifacts usually get bundles in fat jars (namely flink-libraries, flink-connectors, and flink-metrics should override the slf4j and jsr305 dependencies as provided.
