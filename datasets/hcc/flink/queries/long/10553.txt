Since sink table can now be registered using ExternalCatalog, just the same as source table, the source and sink name in SQL statement should also be treated equally. Now we can only use `catalog.database.table` for sink table (enclosed in back-ticks as a identifier), this is not consistent with source table name (do not treat the whole name as a identifier). 

INSERT INTO catalog.database.sinktable SELECT ... FROM catalog.database.sourcetable should be supported .
