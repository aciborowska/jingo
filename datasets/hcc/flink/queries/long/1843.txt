As per FLINK-1442, the JobManager stores the archived ExecutionGraph behind a SoftReference. At least for local setups, this mechanism doesn't seem to work properly. There are two issues:


	The history gets cleared too fast
	The history gets cleared in a non-sequential fashion, i.e. arbitrary old ExecutionGraph are discarded



To solve these problems we might


	Store the least recent ExecutionGraph behind a SoftReference
	Store the most recent ExecutionGraphs without a SoftReference



That way, we can save memory but have the latest history available to the user. We might introduce a configuration variable where the user can specify the number of ExecutionGraphs that should be held in memory. The remaining can be stored behind a SoftReference.
