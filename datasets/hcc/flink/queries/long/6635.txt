The ClientConnectionTest is broken since the refactoring of the ClusterClient. The reason is that we expect an exception to be thrown which contains the word "JobManager". However, in case that the created ClusterClient does not fail, we fail the test with a message containing "JobManager". That is the reason why this test passed even though it actually failed all the time.
