In https://flink.apache.org/improve-website.html

its description is "Open your browser at http://localhost:4000 to view the website",

but in flink-web project, the host config in _config.yml is 0.0.0.0. In this case when we execute ./build.sh -p, it will print info like this "Server address: http://0.0.0.0:4000/" which is actually invalid. I think the default host should be replaced with "localhost".
