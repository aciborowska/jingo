See Supported Data Types in the online documentation. The text specifies that there are "six different categories of data types," but the list below contains seven items. I suggest that you omit a specific number in the sentence preceding the list. Here is a suggestion: "DataSet and DataStream support the following categories of data elements." See the attached screenshot. Note: Please let me know if these types of issues are too trivial to report. Thx.
