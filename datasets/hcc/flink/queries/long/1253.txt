I have seen tests occasionally dying from GC Overhead Limit exceeded exception. I assume it happens because we reuse the JVMs across tests in the unit tests, possibly some test artifacts linger.

I suggest to add the -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit option to the tests, so that they do not break on the build server.
