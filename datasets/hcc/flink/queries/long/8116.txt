Between Flink 1.1 and 1.2, the Checkpointed interface was superseded by the CheckpointedFunction interface.

However, in SourceFunction there are two comments still referring to the old Checkpointed interface. (The code examples there also need to be modified.)

Note that the problem also occurs in StreamExecutionEnvironment, and possibly other places as well.
