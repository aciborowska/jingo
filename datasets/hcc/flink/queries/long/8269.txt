In FLIP-6 mode, the JobMaster does not correctly set the field netRuntime on the JobExecutionResult when the job status transitions to FINISHED.

Find the code in question below:


case FINISHED:
	try {
		// TODO get correct job duration
		// job done, let's get the accumulators
		Map<String, Object> accumulatorResults = executionGraph.getAccumulators();
		JobExecutionResult result = new JobExecutionResult(jobID, 0L, accumulatorResults);
	
		executor.execute(() -> jobCompletionActions.jobFinished(result));
	}
