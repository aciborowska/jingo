When executing a job from the command line for testing, it will output logs like:


Connected to JobManager at Actor[akka://flink/user/jobmanager_1#1337544104] with leader session id 59dd0d9c-938e-4e79-a0eb-709c5cf73014.
09/27/2017 13:15:13	Job execution switched to status RUNNING.
09/27/2017 13:15:13	Source: Custom File Source(1/1) switched to SCHEDULED 
09/27/2017 13:15:13	Source: Collect



It will do so even if the log4j.properties file contains:


log4j.rootLogger=ERROR, stdout
log4j.logger.org.apache.flink=ERROR
log4j.logger.akka=ERROR
log4j.logger.org.apache.kafka=ERROR
log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop=ERROR
log4j.logger.org.apache.zookeeper=ERROR



It seems that the MiniCluster does not honor Log4j settings, or at least that is my guess.
