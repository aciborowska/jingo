Reported in ML: http://apache-flink-user-mailing-list-archive.2336050.n4.nabble.com/Flink-Yarn-and-MapR-Kerberos-issue-td11996.html

The problem is that the Flink on YARN client incorrectly assumes UserGroupInformation.isSecurityEnabled() returns true only for Kerberos authentication modes, whereas it actually returns true for other kinds of authentications too.

We could make use of UserGroupInformation.getAuthenticationMethod() to check for KERBEROS only.
