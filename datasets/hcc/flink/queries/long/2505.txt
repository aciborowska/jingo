I observed a VM crash on one of my builds. Here's the build log:
https://travis-ci.org/apache/flink/jobs/74988472

Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.17:test (default-test) on project flink-fs-tests: ExecutionException: java.lang.RuntimeException: The forked VM terminated without properly saying goodbye. VM crash or System.exit called?
