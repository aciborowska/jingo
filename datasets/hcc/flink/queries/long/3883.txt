I ran into some trouble in preparing a Homebrew formula to install Flink on Mac (homebrew-core#968).   Homebrew can install bin scripts into the system path, e.g. `/usr/local/bin/flink`:

$ cat /usr/local/bin/flink
#!/bin/bash
exec "/usr/local/Cellar/apache-flink/1.0.2/libexec/bin/flink" "$@"



It would be nice to install the various Flink shells too, but their names don't seem ideal for inclusion on the system path.   I propose that they be renamed or aliased to have the following names (old -> new):


"pyflink2.sh" -> "pyflink2"
"pyflink3.sh" -> "pyflink3"
"start-scala-shell.sh" -> "flink-scala-shell"   (note: updated based on feedback)



A related issue is, the shell scripts don't correctly determine their install location when called via a symlink.
