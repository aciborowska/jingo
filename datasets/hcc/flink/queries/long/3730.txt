The test that checks whether a directory is viable is not correct and the tests in `RocksDBStateBackendConfigTest` fail to catch them: `testFailWhenNoLocalStorageDir()` and `testContinueOnSomeDbDirectoriesMissing()`

The problem is that the backend tests whether the dir exists or can be created. The tests create the directory and set it to non-writable. This means that the check accepts these. The job would only fail later when actually trying to create a directory in the initialized data directory.
