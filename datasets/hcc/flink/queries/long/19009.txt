Currently the way to calculate the Flink system metric "downtime"  is not consistent with the description in the doc, now the downtime is actually the current timestamp minus the time timestamp when the job started.
   
But Flink doc (https://flink.apache.org/gettinghelp.html) obviously describes the time as the current timestamp minus the timestamp when the job failed.
 
I believe we should update the code this metric as the Flink doc shows. The easy way to solve this is using the current timestamp to minus the latest uptime timestamp.
