Semantic properties are defined by users and evaluated by the optimizer.
When semantic properties such as forwarded or read fields are bound to the input type of a function.
In case of operators with selector function keys, a user function is wrapped by a wrapping function that has a different input types than the original user function. However, the user-defined semantic properties are verbatim forwarded to the optimizer. 
Since the properties refer to a specific type which is changed by the wrapping function and the semantic properties are not adapted, the optimizer uses wrong properties and might produce invalid plans
