When restoring a savepoint on a HA setup (with ZooKeeper) the web frontend incorrectly says "Type: Checkpoint" in the information box about the latest restore event.

The information that this uses is set here: https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/09caa9ffdc8168610c7d0260360c034ea87f904c/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/checkpoint/CheckpointCoordinator.java#L1101

It seems that the CheckpointProperties of a restored savepoint somehow get lost, maybe because of the recover step that the ZookeeperCompletedCheckpointStore is going through.
