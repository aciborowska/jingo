The fault-tolerance attributes of the streaming sources and sinks should be clearly documented. For example, it should be made clear what the difference between the normal and the PersistentKafkaSource is and what the implications of using the RollingFileSink in fault-tolerance mode are (It requires Hadoop 2.7.X for full fault-tolerance support).

It should be made clear to the users that not all sources/sinks support the exactly-once guarantees. We could point out that this is not necessarily Flink's fault and that some of the applications have to implement proper exactly-once support with the outside world themselves.
