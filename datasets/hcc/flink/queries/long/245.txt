I have played with Scala today. Here is what I have written:

    case class Department(id: String, name:Int)
    ...
    val departments  = DataSource("departments.txt", RecordDataSourceFormat[Department|"\n", " "))
    ...

The departments.txt file looks like this

    5 Marketing
    2 Enginnering
    3 Sales

Note the error in my Department class: the id is defined as a String and the department name is an Integer. What I would expect from the "parser" is to tell me that the file does not match what I prescribed. But if you run this program, there will be no exception and the departments input will be just empty. 

I think that the right thing to do is raise an exception saying that "an error was found while parsing the output. Please check your data types." According to @aljoscha , the problem is in the Java side: `RecordInputFormat`.

So, is this a bug or a feature (maybe, ignoring lines that do not match the data source definition]?
