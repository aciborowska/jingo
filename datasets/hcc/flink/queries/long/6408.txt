We are running flink on mesos in AWS.  Checkpointing is enabled with an s3 backend, configured via the hadoop s3a filesystem implementation and done every second.

We are seeing roughly 3 million log events per hour from a relatively small job, and it appears that this is because every s3 copy event reloads the hadoop configuration, which in turn reloads the flink configuration.  The flink configuration loader is outputting each key/value pair every time it is invoked, leading to this volume of logs.

While the logging is relatively easy to deal with - just a log4j setting - the behaviour is probably suboptimal.  It seems that the configuration loader could easily be changed over to a singleton pattern to prevent the constant rereading of files.

If you're interested, we can probably knock up a patch for this in a relatively short time.

Cheers,
