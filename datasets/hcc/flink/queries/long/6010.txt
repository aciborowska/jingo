In https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.2/internals/ide_setup.html#installing-the-scala-plugin, how you should get to 'plugins' page in IntelliJ IDEA is wrong. This seems to be describing a much older version of IntelliJ IDE.

The correct path now is: IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences -> Plugins -> Install JetBrains plugin 

I'll submit a PR to fix this
