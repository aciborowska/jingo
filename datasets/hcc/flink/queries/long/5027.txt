When reading from a non existing File or a wrong file path, a Flink streaming program finishes successfully even though it should fail with a appropriate error message. This can be misleading since the user is not notified about the wrong file path. 

I think the default behaviour should be that we fail a file streaming source if the file path is wrong.
