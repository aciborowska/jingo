In org.apache.flink.table.runtime.batch.sql.AggregateITCase two tests 
1. testTumbleWindowAggregate and 
2. testHopWindowAggregate 
are failing for some time zones.

Bug can be produced by changing the time zone of machine to
Time Zone: Central Daylight Time
Closest City: Houston-United States

I think, problem is with Timestamp.
