Have a flink app running in standalone mode. The app runs ok in our non-prod env. However on our prod server it throws this exception:

Buffer pool is destroyed. 

 

This error is being thrown as a RuntimeException on the collect call, on the flatmap function. The flatmap is just collecting a Tuple<String, Document>, the Document is a XML Document object.

 

As mentioned the non prod env  (and we have multiple, DEV,QA,UAT) this is not happening. The UAT box is spec-ed exactly as our Prod host with 4CPU. The java version is the same too.

 

Not sure how to proceed.

 

Thanks
