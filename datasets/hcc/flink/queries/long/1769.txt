The issue has been introduced by FLINK-1720.

This change broke the deployment to maven snapshots / central.


[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:2.5.1:install (default-install) on project flink-shaded-include-yarn: Failed to install artifact org.apache.flink:flink-shaded-include-yarn:pom:0.9-SNAPSHOT: /home/robert/incubator-flink/flink-shaded-hadoop/flink-shaded-include-yarn/target/dependency-reduced-pom.xml (No such file or directory) -> [Help 1]



The issue is that maven is now executing clean after shade and then install can not store the result of shade anymore (because it has been deleted)
