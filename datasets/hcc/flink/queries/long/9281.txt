I am trying to get Flink to work with Logback instead of Log4J.   However, it is not working. 

My setup is as follows the advice on this page: https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.4/dev/best_practices.html#use-logback-when-running-flink-on-a-cluster

	Flink v1.4.2 running a stand-alone cluster. 
	Started JobManager as a foreground process (bin/jobmanager.sh start-foreground cluster).  I updated bin/flink-console.sh to reference logback.xml via -Dlogback.configurationFile=file:/path/to/logfile.
	Removed log4j jars under libs/  (log4j-1.2.xx.jar and sfl4j-log4j12-xxx.jar)
	Added logback jars under libs/   (logback-classic, logback-core, log4j-over-slf4j.jar) 



However, I am not getting any file created.   Also, as a dumb test I referenced a non-existent logback.xml file (changed path to a non-existent folder) just to see if any errors appear on stdout, but nothing.

Thanks
