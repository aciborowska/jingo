The RFC for the CSV format specifies that double quotes are valid in quoted strings in CSV, by doubling the quote character:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180

However, when parsing a CSV file with Flink containing quoted quotes, such as:

bob,"The name is ""Bob"""

you get this exception:

org.apache.flink.api.common.io.ParseException: Line could not be parsed: 'bob,"The name is ""Bob"""'
ParserError UNQUOTED_CHARS_AFTER_QUOTED_STRING 
Expect field types: class java.lang.String, class java.lang.String
