Currently, we do not explicitly set the RestartPolicy for the task manager pods in the native K8s setups so that it is Always by default.  The task manager pod itself should not restart the failed Container, the decision should always be made by the job manager.

Therefore, this ticket proposes to set the RestartPolicy to Never for the task manager pods.
