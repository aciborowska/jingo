Replace definition in stringExpression.scala has another constructor with 2 arguments.

According to source code, the args' meaning are str, begin. And it call other constructor with 3 args adding the 3rd arg which is the length of str.

But its expectTypes is (String, String, String), but actually is (String, int, int).

So I think the 2 args defined constructor means search and replacement is "" default, not begin and length of str.Â
