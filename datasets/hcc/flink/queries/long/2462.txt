When streaming tasks are fail and are canceled, they report a plethora of followup exceptions.

The batch operators have a clear model that makes sure that root causes are reported, and followup exceptions are not reported. That makes debugging much easier.

A big part of that is to have a single consistent place that logs exceptions, and that has a view of whether the operation is still running, or whether it has been canceled.
