Steps to reproduce:

	Upload file from IE 11
	Click "submit" job.
	Nothing happens.



I've made investigation and found 2 issues:

	By default Internet Explorer sends full file path. That's why org.apache.flink.runtime.webmonitor.HttpRequestHandler # String name = file.getFilename(); will return c32\path\git\path\some.jar. During rendering UI at "/#/submit" all file names will be encoded. Which result "c32/path/git/path/some.jar?run". Which obviously won't match any servlet on server side (404 not found)
	When non 200 status returned (404, for example) during jar run, then no message shown to user. I suppose ajax.error should be handled properly.
