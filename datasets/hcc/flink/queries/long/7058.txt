Activation of profile scala-2.10 in `flink-scala-shell` and `flink-scala` do not work as intended. 


	<profiles>
		<profile>
			<id>scala-2.10</id>
			<activation>	
  				<property>
  					<name>!scala-2.11</name>
  				</property>
			</activation>
			<dependencies>
				<dependency>
					<groupId>org.scalamacros</groupId>
					<artifactId>quasiquotes_2.10</artifactId>
					<version>${scala.macros.version}</version>
				</dependency>

				<dependency>
					<groupId>org.scala-lang</groupId>
					<artifactId>jline</artifactId>
					<version>2.10.4</version>
				</dependency>
			</dependencies>
		</profile>
	</profiles>
<activation>
</activation>


This activation IMO have nothing to do with `-Pscala-2.11` profile switch used in our build. "properties" are defined by `-Dproperty` switches. As far as I understand that, those additional dependencies would be added only if nobody defined property named `scala-2.11`, which means, they would be added only if switch `-Dscala-2.11` was not used, so it seems like those dependencies were basically added always. This quick test proves that I'm correct:


$ mvn dependency:tree -pl flink-scala | grep quasi
[INFO] +- org.scalamacros:quasiquotes_2.10:jar:2.1.0:compile
$ mvn dependency:tree -pl flink-scala -Pscala-2.11 | grep quasi
[INFO] +- org.scalamacros:quasiquotes_2.10:jar:2.1.0:compile
$ mvn dependency:tree -pl flink-scala -Pscala-2.10 | grep quasi
[INFO] +- org.scalamacros:quasiquotes_2.10:jar:2.1.0:compile



regardless of the selected profile those dependencies are always there.
