Currently the TaskManagerRunner would be waiting for rpc service terminated synchronously. If this happened in rpc service related thread (akka dispatcher thread), it would be stuck forever.

We should change the behavior like in ClusterEntrypoint, make it not waiting but asynchronous with a future.
