In close, it await the flush scheduler terminal, but it hold the lock of JDBCUpsertOutputFormat instance, maybe the async thread is waiting for this lock in the flush method, so there might be a deadlock here.

First, it should not await scheduler terminal, because it has flushed all data to jdbc, what we should do is let async thread quit.

Second, we should add lock outside the closed check in the flusher, in this way, we can ensure async thread secure exiting.
