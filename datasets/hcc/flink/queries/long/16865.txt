【Flink Kafka Connector】

If the job adds another Kafka topic when the job start from Savepoint, it will start to consume from the earlist of that topic, it may cause duplicate data sink.

I found that the configuration is already written in the code FlinkKafkaConsumerBase#open(), maybe it can be Configurable.
