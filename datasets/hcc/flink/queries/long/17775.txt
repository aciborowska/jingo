We have a batch job in the likes of this:

 


ExecutionEnvironment env = ExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
DataSet<Row> dataSet = getDataSet();
dataSet
 .sortPartition(MyRow::getCount, Order.DESCENDING)
 .setParallelism(1)
 .flatMap(new MyFlatMap())
 .collect();
env.execute("Job at " + Instant.now().toString());



However, the job name in the flink UI is not "Job at <date>" but the default as if I didn't put anything.

 

Is there way to have my own flink job name?
