Here is my class define:

class MyRecord extends Row implements Retracting, Value {}

When i use it like below, it just throw type cast error: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.flink.types.Row cannot be cast to org.apache.flink.types.Value

MyRecord[] recordList = new MyRecord[6];
DataStream<MyRecord> dataStream = env.fromElements(recordList);
//MyFilter 's input arg type is MyRecord.
dataStream.flatMap(new MyFilter()).returns(MyRecord.class).print();

I found this is becuase of the TypeExtractor.getForObject called in env.fromElements() can't get the 
element's type corrently and TypeExtractor.getForObject work corrently in flink 1.2.0. 

I know this problem can be solved by use env.fromElement(MyRecord.class, recordList) instead, i just want to know whether this is a bug or not? Why it can be work correctly in 1.2.0 and can't in 1.3.0?
