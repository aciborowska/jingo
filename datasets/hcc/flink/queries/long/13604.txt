For Blink Planner:

	Time(3) is converted to Time, the precision is lost
	ROW<`f0` INT NOT NULL, `f1` BOOLEAN> is converted to ROW<`f0` INT, `f1` BOOLEAN>, the nullable attr is lost



the conversion code is:



LogicalTypeDataTypeConverter.fromLogicalTypeToDataType(FlinkTypeFactory.toLogicalType(relType));



For Flink planner:

	All the Char type is converted to String type, which is totally wrong.
	All the decimal type is converted to Legacy(BigDecimal) which is confusing ..



The conversion code is:



TypeConversions.fromLegacyInfoToDataType(FlinkTypeFactory.toTypeInfo(relType))



Please see the tests SqlToOperationConverterTest#testCreateTableWithFullDataTypes.
