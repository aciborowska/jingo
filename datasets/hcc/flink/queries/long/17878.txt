StreamingFileWriter has a 

private transient long currentWatermark = Long.MIN_VALUE;

 

in case developer wants to create a custom bucket assigner, it will receive a currentWatermark as 0, this might be conflict with the original flink approach to handle a min_long.

 

should we remove the transient key word?
