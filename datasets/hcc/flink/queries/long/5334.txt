The scala quickstart set up via sbt-quickstart.sh or from the repository at https://github.com/tillrohrmann/flink-project seems outdated compared to what is set up with the maven archetype, e.g. Job.scala vs. BatchJob.scala and StreamingJob.scala. This should probably be updated and also the hard-coded example in sbt-quickstart.sh on the web page could be removed and download the newest version instead as the mvn command does.

see https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.2/quickstart/scala_api_quickstart.html for these two paths (SBT vs. Maven)
