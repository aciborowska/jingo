The SpanningRecordSerializer creates large byte arrays to buffer records during serialization. Since they never release the records, they may occupy a large amount of memory. Currently, we use one per output partition, which is due to the original architecture.

There are two ways to fix this:

 1. Use only one serializer per output, rather than one per output partition. This is the preferable way in the long run anyways.

 2. Release the arrays in the serializer (quick fix).
