Code below throws the reason 'message' away making it hard to diagnose why a split has failed for instance.

 



https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-streaming-java/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/runtime/tasks/StreamTask.java#L909

@Override
	public void handleAsyncException(String message, Throwable exception) {
	if (isRunning) {
	// only fail if the task is still running
	getEnvironment().failExternally(exception);
	}
}

 

Need to pass the message through so that we see it in logs please.
