In version 1.1.0 we made the RMQSource extensible so that subclasses can configure how they want their queue for RabbitMQ/AMQP create. The subclasses can override 


	protected void setupQueue() throws IOException {
		channel.queueDeclare(queueName, true, false, false, null);
	}




The problem is, that the queueName property is private. So when override the setupQueue parameter, you don't know what actual queueName was provided. A simple change of the queueName property to protected fixes this.
