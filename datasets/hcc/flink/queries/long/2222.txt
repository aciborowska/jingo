The memory/CPU graphs on the web frontend's TaskManager page are not well formatted using Chrome/Safari. 

The legend is displayed in the lower left corner concealing parts of the axis. 

Furthermore, the axis labels are placed too close to the axis so that they overlap with the tick labels of the axis.

The displayed graph does not fill the complete space between the left and right vertical axis.
