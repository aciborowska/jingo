If task is blocked for more than 60 seconds (org.apache.flink.metrics.MeterView#DEFAULT_TIME_SPAN_IN_SECONDS), idleTimeMsPerSecond can be reported as zero, despite task being completely idle. Once the task is unblocked and the idleTimeMsPerSecond metric is updated, it can for the next 60 seconds exceed 1000ms/second.

Average value over the longer periods of time will be correct and accurate.
