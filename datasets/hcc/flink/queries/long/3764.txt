The LeaderChangeStateCleanupTest.testStateCleanupAfterListenerNotification fails spuriously on Travis because of a NullPointerException. The reason is that it's not properly waited until the ResourceManager has been started. Due to this, it can happen that a leader notification message is tried to be sent to a LeaderRetrievalListener which has not been set by the ResourceManager.
