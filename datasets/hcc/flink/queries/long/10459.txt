Trying to run flink 1.6.1/1.5.4 cluster in Kubernetes, using default kubernetes deployment from flink docs. Jobmanager and taskmanagers starts successfully but in web UI I see zero taskmanagers available. Flink had issue when jobmanger was not able to connect to itself via k8s service name, but this seems different issue.

Jobmanger config shows cluster as jobmanager.rpc.address



Jobmanger and taskmanager logs attached
