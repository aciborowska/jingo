StreamingJobGraphGenerator.isChainable dose not consider the coLocationGroup, if A -> B is chained, the coLocationGroup of the corresponding JobVertex will be set with that of the head node, namely A. Therefore, if B has declared coLocationGroup but A does not, then the coLocationGroup of B will be ignored.
