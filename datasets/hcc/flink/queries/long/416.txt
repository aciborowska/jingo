Hello,
a Stratosphere user send me an email regarding two failing test cases in the current 0.4 stable release.


https://gist.github.com/rmetzger/8521843
https://gist.github.com/rmetzger/8521862

It seems to be an issue with the Scala interface?


Some more information


	openSuse 11.4
Tested on three different computers 
	Computer 1, User 1: works.
	Computer 1, User 2: fails.
	Computer 2, User 2: fails.
Seems to be an issue with the user-environment or so?



Its the release-0.4 branch and the error occurs with mvn clean verify.
