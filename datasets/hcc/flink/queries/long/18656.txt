As visible in the attached screenshot, start delay is 0, despite very high end to end time and very quick async/sync times. This is impossible, as "start delay" should be equal to "end_to_end_time - sync_time - async_time".

The bug is probably in CheckpointBarrierUnaligner class, which seems to never invoke CheckpointBarrierHandler#markCheckpointStart.

It's important to make sure this metric is also set for source tasks (time to acquire checkpoint lock).
