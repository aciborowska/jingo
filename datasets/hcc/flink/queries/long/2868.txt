      // release the output resources. this method should never fail.
      if (operatorChain != null) {
        operatorChain.releaseOutputs();
      }
...
      if (!disposed) {
        disposeAllOperators();
      }


If operatorChain is null, disposeAllOperators() shouldn't be called where operatorChain.getAllOperators() is called.
