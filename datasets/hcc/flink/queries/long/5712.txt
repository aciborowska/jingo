1. We should use 'containerized.heap-cutoff-ratio' and 'containerized.heap-cutoff-min' instead of deprecated yarn-specific options in configuration doc.

2. In mesos mode, we still use deprecated naming convention of zookeeper - 'recovery.zookeeper.path.mesos-workers'. We should make it consistent with other zookeeper options by using 'high-availability.zookeeper.path.mesos-workers'.
