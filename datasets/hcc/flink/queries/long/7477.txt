Currently, some cloud environments don't properly put the Hadoop jars into HADOOP_CLASSPATH (or don't set HADOOP_CLASSPATH) at all. We should check in config.sh if the hadoop binary is on the path and augment our INTERNAL_HADOOP_CLASSPATHS with the result of hadoop classpath in our scripts.

This will improve the out-of-box experience of users that otherwise have to manually set HADOOP_CLASSPATH.
