As part of FLINK-11086, we introduced the setting of the yarn class path in a static initializer of YarnTestBase.java:199. The yarn class path file will be generated by the maven-dependency-plugin in the package phase. Due to this, the yarn.classpath file won't be accessible to all users of the YarnTestBase class which are run in a previous phase (e.g. UtilsTest.testUberjarLocator).
