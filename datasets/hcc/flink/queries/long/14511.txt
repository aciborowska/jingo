As we all know, all queues in the YARN cluster are children of the "root" queue. While submitting an application to "root.product" queue with -qu product parameter, the client logs that "The specified queue 'product' does not exist. Available queues....". But this queue is exist and we can still submit application to YARN cluster, which is confusing for users. So I think that when checking queues should add "root." prefix to the queue name.




List<QueueInfo> queues = yarnClient.getAllQueues();
if (queues.size() > 0 && this.yarnQueue != null) { // check only if there are queues configured in yarn and for this session.
	boolean queueFound = false;
	for (QueueInfo queue : queues) {
		if (queue.getQueueName().equals(this.yarnQueue) {
			queueFound = true;
			break;
		}
	}
	if (!queueFound) {
		String queueNames = "";
		for (QueueInfo queue : queues) {
			queueNames += queue.getQueueName() + ", ";
		}
		LOG.warn("The specified queue '" + this.yarnQueue + "' does not exist. " +
				"Available queues: " + queueNames);
	}
