The sample Java code for the Elasticsearch 2.x sink doc[1] has numerous errors in it, which seems to be resulting from porting the Scala example to Java.

e.g.

  public IndexRequest createIndexRequest(String element): IndexRequest = {
    Map<String,String> json = new HashMap<>()
    json.put("data", element)
