The Table API SqlExplain(Test/ITCase) fail categorically on Windows due to different line-endings. These tests generate an string representation of an abstract syntax tree; problem is there is a difference in line-endings.

The expected ones contain LF, the actual one CRLF.

The tests should be either changed to either

	include CRLF line-endings in the expected string when run on windows
	always use LF line-endings regardless of OS
	use a compare method that is aware of this issue.
