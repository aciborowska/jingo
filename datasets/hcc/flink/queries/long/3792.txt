Currently, two Rows with the same field types but different field names are not considered equal by the Table API and SQL. This behavior might create problems, e.g. it makes the following union query fail:


SELECT STREAM a, b, c FROM T1 UNION ALL 
(SELECT STREAM d, e, f FROM T2 WHERE d < 3)



where a, b, c and d, e, f are fields of corresponding types.


Cannot union streams of different types: org.apache.flink.api.table.Row(a: Integer, b: Long, c: String) and org.apache.flink.api.table.Row(d: Integer, e: Long, f: String)
