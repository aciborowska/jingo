I my Flink job, I've set the following execution config

final ExecutionEnvironment env = ExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
env.getConfig().disableObjectReuse();
env.getConfig().enableForceKryo();



Setting a breakpoint in the PojoSerializer() constructor, you'll see that we still serialize data with the POJO serializer.
