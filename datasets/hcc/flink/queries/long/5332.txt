This is mainly relevant to tests and Local Mini Cluster executions.

The FileOutputFormat and its subclasses rely on FileSystem::initOutPathLocalFS() to prepare the output directory. When multiple parallel output writers call that method, there is a slim chance that one parallel threads deletes the others directory. The checks that the method has are not bullet proof.

I believe that this is the cause for many Travis test instabilities that we observed over time.

Simply synchronizing that method per process should do the trick. Since it is a rare initialization method, and only relevant in tests & local mini cluster executions, it should be a price that is okay to pay. I see no other way, as we do not have simple access to an atomic "check and delete and recreate" file operation.

The synchronization also makes many "re-try" code paths obsolete (there should be no re-tries needed on proper file systems).
