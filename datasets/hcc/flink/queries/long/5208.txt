[~StephanEwen] has been investigating a YARN test failure, and it seems that the failure boils down to the following:

12:14:44,069 INFO  org.apache.hadoop.yarn.util.AbstractLivelinessMonitor         - Expired:appattempt_1480335230724_0003_000001 Timed out after 20 secs



We should look into a way of increasing that timeout to make the YARN tests more robust.
