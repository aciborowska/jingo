elasticsearch transport sink init steps

1, create client thread

2, try to check every host:port

3, if each host:port is unreachable, while throw RuntimeException

but, because of throw RuntimeException, the client can not close, so causing thread leak
transport client code

```

TransportClient transportClient = new PreBuiltTransportClient(settings);
for (TransportAddress transport : ElasticsearchUtils.convertInetSocketAddresses(transportAddresses)) 
{
 transportClient.addTransportAddress(transport);
}

// verify that we actually are connected to a clusterif (transportClient.connectedNodes().isEmpty()) {
 throw new RuntimeException("Elasticsearch client is not connected to any Elasticsearch nodes!");
}

return transportClient;
}

```
thread leak


thread dump
