Hi,

I have been wrestling with a issue with GlobalWindows. It seems like it leaks instances of InternalTimer.

I can't tell if it's a bug or my code so I created a 'minimal' project that has the issue...

If you run the Unit Test  in the attached and then monitor heap you will see that the number of InternalTimers continually increases. I added code to explicitly delete them.. doesn't seem to help.

If I comment out registerEventTimeTimer ... no leak 

My suspicion is that PURGE/FIRE_AND_PURGE is leaving the timer in limbo.
