(1) The comments in WorksetConnectedComponents obviously refer to K-Means

(2) The wiring of the iteration seems to be wrong, the next workset is produced by joinWithNeighbors not by updateComponentId

    iteration.setNextWorkset(updateComponentId);
    iteration.setSolutionSetDelta(updateComponentId);
