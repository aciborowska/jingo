Removed legacy Nephele cloud code. Among others, all InstanceType related code is removed. Furthermore, a simple slot system for the TaskManager is introduced. Each TaskManager has a set of slots. Either the number is set in the configuration or the number of cores is taken as the default value. This implies that the intra-node parallelism was abandoned. Additionally a relative memory assignment was implemented. During the compiling process, for each task its memory share is calculated. Once deployed this value is translated with respect to the available memory on the TaskManager.
