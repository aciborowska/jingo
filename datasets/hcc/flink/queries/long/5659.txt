The 

FileBaseUtils#deleteFileOrDirectory

 is not thread-safe on Windows.

First you will run into AccessDeniedExceptions since one thread tried to delete a file while another thread was already doing that, for which the file has to be opened.

Once you resolve those exceptions (by catching them double checking whether the file still exists), you run into DirectoryNotEmptyExceptions since there is some wacky timing/visibility issue when deleting files concurrently.
