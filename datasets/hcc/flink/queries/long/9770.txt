The jar listing in the UI is broken.

The JarListHandler expects a specific naming scheme (<UUID>_<jar_name>) for uploaded jars, which the FileUploadHandler previously adhered to.

When the file uploads were generalized this naming scheme was removed from the FileUploadHandler, but neither was the JarListHandler adjusted nor was this behavior re-introduced in the JarUploadHandler.
