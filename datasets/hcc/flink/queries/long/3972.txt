WorkerTypes are currently subclasses of ResourceID. ResourceID has to be Serializable but its subclasses don't. This may lead to problems when these subclasses are used as ResourceIDs, i.e. serialization may fail with NotSerializableExceptions. Currently, subclasses are never send over the wire but they might be in the future.

Instead of relying on subclasses of ResourceID for the WorkerTypes, we can let them implement an interface to retrieve the ResourceID of a WorkerType.
