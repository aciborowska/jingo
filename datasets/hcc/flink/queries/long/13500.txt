RestClusterClient initialization calls ClusterClient initialization, which calls
org.apache.flink.runtime.highavailability.HighAvailabilityServicesUtils.createHighAvailabilityServices
In turn, createHighAvailabilityServices calls BlobUtils.createBlobStoreFromConfig, which in our case tries to talk to S3.

It seems very surprising to me that (a) RestClusterClient needs any form of access other than to the REST API, and (b) that client initialization would attempt a write as a side effect. I do not see either of these surprising facts described in the documentation–are they intentional?
