Currently nested fields can only be accessed through fully qualified identifiers. For example, users need to specify the following query for the table f that has a nested field foo.bar


SELECT f.foo.bar FROM f



Other query engines like Hive / Presto supports implicit table references. For example:


SELECT foo.bar FROM f



This jira proposes to support the latter syntax in the SQL API.
