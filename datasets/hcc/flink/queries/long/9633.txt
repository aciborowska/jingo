Currently, flink use the Savepoint's filesystem to create the meta output stream in CheckpointCoordinator(JM side), but in StreamTask(TM side) it uses the Checkpoint's filesystem to create the checkpoint data output stream. When the Savepoint & Checkpoint in different filesystem this will lead to problematic.
