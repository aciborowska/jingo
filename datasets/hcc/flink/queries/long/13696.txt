We should revisit and update Flink's public API. As indicated by FLINK-13586, Flink's user facing classes and interfaces are not properly annotated. I think we should revisit this topic and rethink which classes and interfaces are part of Flink's public surface area with which users interact.

For example, we have the ClosureCleaner which is used by several connector implementations. Consequently, the ClosureCleaner should be part of Flink's public API so that any changes to this class will be spotted by the japicmp plugin.
