Proper Flink cluster components, e.g. task manager or job manager, initialize configured file systems with their parsed Configuration objects. However, the LocalEnvironment does not seem to do that and we therefore lack the ability to configure access credentials etc like in the following example:


        Configuration config = new Configuration();
        config.setString("s3.access-key", "user");
        config.setString("s3.secret-key", "secret");
//        FileSystem.initialize(config);
        final ExecutionEnvironment exEnv = ExecutionEnvironment.createLocalEnvironment(config);



The workaround is to call FileSystem.initialize(config); yourself but it is actually surprising that this is not done automatically.
