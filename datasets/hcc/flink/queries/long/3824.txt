When the ResourceManager receives a new leading JobManager via the LeaderRetrievalService it tries to register with this JobManager until connected. If during registration a new leader gets elected, the ResourceManager may still repeatedly try to register with the old one. This doesn't affect the registration with the new JobManager but leaves error messages in the log file and may process unnecessary messages.
