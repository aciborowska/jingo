Plans with a keyless-Reducer cause the pact web visualization to fail:
```Unknown local strategy 'ALL_GROUP' in JSON generator.```

The switch statement in ```PlanJSONDumpGenerator``` has to be updated (anything else?). The bugfix seems to be simple, however I did want to talk to someone about this before adding a pullrequest.

Stephan recently reimplemented keyless-reducers, see https://github.com/dimalabs/ozone/pull/61
