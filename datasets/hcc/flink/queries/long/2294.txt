When changing the DOP from 3 to 1 in StatefulOperatorTest.apiTest() the test fails. The reason seems to be that the element is not properly set when chaining is happening.

Also, requiring this:

headContext.setNextInput(nextRecord);
streamOperator.processElement(nextRecord);



to be called seems rather fragile. Why not set the element in processElement(). This would also make for cleaner encapsulation, since now all outside code must assume that operators have a StreamingRuntimeContext on which they set the next element.

The state/keyed state machinery seems dangerously undertested.
