When using CompressWriterFactory with Hadoop compression codec, the execution fails with java.io.NotSerializableException. 

I guess this is probably to do with the the instance creation for Hadoop's CompressionCodec being done here at CompressWriterFactory.java#L59 and thus it has to be sent over the wire causing the exception to be thrown.

So I did a quick test on my end by changing the way the CompressionCodec is initialised and ran it on a Hadoop cluster, and it has been working just fine. Will raise a PR in a day or so.
