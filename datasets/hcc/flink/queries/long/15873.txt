When running some cep jobs with skip strategy, I found that when we get a matched result, but if there is an earlier partial matches, the result will not be returned.

I think this is due to a bug inÂ processMatchesAccordingToSkipStrategy() in NFA class. It should return matched result without judging whether this is partial matches.
