If <flink-dir>/build-target already exists, 'mvn package' for flink-dist  will create a symbolic link inside <flink-dir>/build-target instead of replacing that symlink. This is due to the behaviour of ln -sf for target links that point to directories and may be solved by adding the --no-dereference parameter.
