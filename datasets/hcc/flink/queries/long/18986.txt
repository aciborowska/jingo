The KubernetesSessionCli creates a ClusterClient for retrieving the clusterId if the cluster was just started.

However, thisÂ clusterId is only used in attached executions.

For detached deployments where kubernetes.rest-service.exposed.type is set to ClusterIP this results in unnecessary error messages about the RestClusterClient not being able to be created.

Given that there is no need to create the client in this situation, we should skip this step.
