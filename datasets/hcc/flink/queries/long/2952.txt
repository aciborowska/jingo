In Flink 0.9.0, I observed that runtimes over 24 hours are reported incorrectly on the page that presents details of finished jobs (reachable from the Job history). In fact, it seems that it fails to display days: In my example the actual runtime of 36 hours was displayed as 12 hours.
Due to the long runtime, I could not reproduce this on 0.9.1...
