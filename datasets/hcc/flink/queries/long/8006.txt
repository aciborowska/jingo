When executing `./bin/start-local.sh` I get

flink-1.3.2/bin/flink-daemon.sh: line 79: $pid: ambiguous redirect
flink-1.3.2/bin/flink-daemon.sh: line 103: [: /tmp/flink-Alejandro: binary operator expected

I solved the problem replacing $pid by "$pid" in lines 79 and 103.

Should I make a PR to the repo?
