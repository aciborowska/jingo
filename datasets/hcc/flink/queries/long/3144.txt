When no loggers have been configured, i.e. log4j.properties is not present in the classpath, Storm local cluster executions print nothing. This may be counter-intuitive for the user.

The reason for this behavior is that the Storm job is submitted detached to make it execute non-blocking. Instead, we should submit it non-detached in a separate thread. We can then enable printing to sysout in addition to logging like regular Flink jobs do it as well.
