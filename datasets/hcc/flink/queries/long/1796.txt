We use process reaper actors (a typical Akka design pattern) to shut down the JVM processes when the core actors die, as this is currently unrecoverable.

The local mode uses the process reaper only for the JobManager actor, not for the TaskManager actor. This may lead to dead stale JVMs on critical TaskManager errors and makes debugging harder.
