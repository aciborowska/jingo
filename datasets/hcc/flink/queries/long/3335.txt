From DataSourceTask.invoke():


if ((returned = format.nextRecord(serializer.createInstance())) != null) {
    output.collect(returned);
}



The returned value (returned) must be copied rather than creating and passing in a new instance. The InputFormat interface only permits the given object to be used and does not require a new object to be returned otherwise.
