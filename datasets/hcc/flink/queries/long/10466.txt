may be adding


<dependency>
 <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
 <artifactId>flink-dist_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>
 <version>${project.version}</version>
 <scope>test</scope>
 <type>pom</type>
</dependency>

not really sure but it causes failure on my automate testing process, and by adding this dependencyÂ the error disappear. Even I wonder how it works currently on travis.

flink-yarn-test obviously depends on flink-dist since some tests try to find flink uberjar.

Please take a look for this. cc [~Zentol]
