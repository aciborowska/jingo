When taskmanager.memory.off-heap is disabled, 
the heap size is set to the jvm size,
which makes the off heap size to be -1 (unlimited).  As a result YARN occasionally kills the container.

final long offHeapSize = javaMemorySizeMB == heapSizeMB ? -1L : javaMemorySizeMB - heapSizeMB; 


It'e better set a limit for direct memory no matter off-heap enabled or not.
