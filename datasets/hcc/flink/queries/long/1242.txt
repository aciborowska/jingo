I get the following error: maven-dependency-plugin (goals "copy-dependencies", "unpack") is not supported by m2e

I think it should be possible to define an entry in the m2e lifecycle plugin to ignore this plugin command. We have done this various times for other plugins not supported by m2e. flink-tests/pom.xml does that for example (very bottom)
