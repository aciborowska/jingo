I often see the initialization of Netty taking 3 seconds and then failing with the message 

"WARN  io.netty.util.internal.ThreadLocalRandom                      - Failed to generate a seed from SecureRandom within 3 seconds. Not enough entrophy?"

This adds to every single run a 3 seconds delay, which is often more than the test time and causes our builds to run out of time.
