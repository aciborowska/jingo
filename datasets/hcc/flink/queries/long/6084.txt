The cassandra client defines metrics-core as a dependency, but the shading is dropping the dependency when building the dependency reduced pom.
To resolve the issue, we need to add the following line into the shading config of the cassandra module:

<promoteTransitiveDependencies>true</promoteTransitiveDependencies>

This makes the metrics dependency appear again in the dep red pom.
