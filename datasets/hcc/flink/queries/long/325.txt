YARN's web interface allows to track the application master using a special tracking url.
It is a proxy that routes the requests to the right container (that of the application master).
Since the request urls of the web interface are somewhat hard coded. Currently the ajax requests look like `/jobsInfo` but the proxy urls look like `http://localhost:8088/proxy/application_1386532236961_0001/`
