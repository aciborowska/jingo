Tests like the ClassLoaderITCase use relative paths to find some jars. The working directory (basedir) is changed by the Maven Shade plugin when it has dependencyReducedPomLocation configured.

Thus, we need to explicitly set the working directory (if possibly in the plugin configuration) or prevent shading from execute.
