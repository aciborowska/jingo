The TaskExecutor should deregister jobs from the JobLeaderService once it no longer holds slots for this job. The problem is that before unregistering the job from the JobLeaderService in TaskExecutor#freeInternal, the actual slot is freed which also removes the JobID from the slot. Therefore, we lose the information to which job the slot belonged. An easy solution would be to return a SlotInformation object instead of the TaskSlot from TaskSlotTable#freeSlot which contains the respective information.
