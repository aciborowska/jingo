The Yarn CLI should handle the following situations correctly:


	The user specifies no parallelism -> parallelism is adjusted to #taskSlots * #nodes.




	The user specifies parallelism but no #taskSlots or too few slots -> #taskSlots are set such that they meet the parallelism



These functionality has been present in Flink 1.0.x but there were some glitches in the implementation.
