In the wake of reworking the timestamp assignment where the processing timestamp has to be set now by the StreamOperator, the CEP operators have not been adapted. This causes that the timestamp value assigned to the StreamRecord is used. In case of processing time this is Long.MIN_VALUE. In combination with a CEP time window, this can lead to an underflow in the NFA where the window time is subtracted from the current timestamp value.
