Both build-docs.sh -i and build-docs.sh -p currently fail (also in the dockerized builds in docs/docker):

jekyll 3.7.2 | Error:  Too many open files - Failed to initialize inotify: the user limit on the total number of inotify instances has been reached.



I wouldn't suggest working around by setting a higher inotify limit but upgrading jekyll did not solve it and so far there are two options:

	disable watching files via --no-watch
	use polling instead of `inotify` via `--force_polling`
	try to reduce the set of files by adding excludes for (expected) static files
