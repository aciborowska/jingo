Currently, in blink planner, we will convert DDL to TableSchema with new type system, i.e. DataTypes.TIMESTAMP()/DATE()/TIME() whose underlying TypeInformation are  Types.LOCAL_DATETIME/LOCAL_DATE/LOCAL_TIME. 

However, this makes the existing connector implementations (Kafka, ES, CSV, etc..) don't work because they only accept the old TypeInformations (Types.SQL_TIMESTAMP/SQL_DATE/SQL_TIME).

A simple solution is encode DataTypes.TIMESTAMP() as "TIMESTAMP" when translating to properties. And will be converted back to the old TypeInformation: Types.SQL_TIMESTAMP. This would fix all factories at once.
