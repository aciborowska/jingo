This is observed and proposed by Robert during 1.10.1 RC1 check:

Another question that I had while checking the release was the
"apache-flink-1.10.1.tar.gz" binary, which I suppose is the python
distribution.
It does not contain a LICENSE and NOTICE file at the root level (which is
okay [1] for binary releases), but in the "pyflink/" directory. There is
also a "deps/" directory, which contains a full distribution of Flink,
without any license files.
I believe it would be a little bit nicer to have the LICENSE and NOTICE
file in the root directory (if the python wheels format permits) to make
sure it is obvious that all binary release contents are covered by these
files.
