some modules forgot to specify the version of their build-helper-maven-plugin which causes the following warning in a maven build:


[WARNING] 'build.plugins.plugin.version' for org.codehaus.mojo:build-helper-maven-plugin is missing. @ org.apache.flink:flink-connector-kafka-base_${scala.binary.version}:[unknown-version], /home/nico/Projects/flink/flink-connectors/flink-connector-kafka-base/pom.xml, line 216, column 12
[WARNING] It is highly recommended to fix these problems because they threaten the stability of your build.
