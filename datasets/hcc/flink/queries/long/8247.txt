In Hadoop-free mode, Hadoop isn't on the classpath.  The Mesos job manager normally uses the Hadoop UserGroupInformation class to overlay a user context (`HADOOP_USER_NAME`) for the task managers.  

Detect the absence of Hadoop and skip over the `HadoopUserOverlay`, similar to the logic in `HadoopModuleFactory`.    This may require the introduction of an overlay factory.
