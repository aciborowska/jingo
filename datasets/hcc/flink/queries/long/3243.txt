As per the discussion on the Dev ML: http://apache-flink-mailing-list-archive.1008284.n3.nabble.com/DISCUSS-Time-Behavior-in-Streaming-Jobs-Event-time-processing-time-td9616.html.

The discussion seems to have converged on option 2):

	Add dedicated WindowAssigners for processing time and event time
	timeWindow() and timeWindowAll() respect the set TimeCharacteristic.



This will make the easy stuff easy, i.e. using time windows and quickly switching the time characteristic. Users will then have the flexibility to mix different kinds of window assigners in their job.
