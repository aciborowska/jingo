en.As soon as a DataSet exceeds a certain size (1000000 tuples in my example) a Selfjoin with a FlatJoinFunction no longer works. After around a second the Join, DataSource and DataSink threads are all in Wait and don't perform any work (no output files are created) and the job never finishes.

If I cut the input size in half it works fine.

My current workaround is to create the DataSet twice and join the two identical DataSets.
