First draft of a webinterface (info server) for the JobManager. At the moment the info server is only started when using the shell script for starting the job manager (i.e. start-local.sh).
The default URL to access the info server is http://localhost:8081

Currently the info server gives an overview over all running jobs and tasks. Dependend Tasks are connected. For sake of human readability I restricted the shown states in the overview to:
started = CREATED || SCHEDULED || ASSIGNED || READY || STARTING
running = RUNNING
finished = FINISHING || FINISHED || CANCELING || CANCELED
failed = FAILED

Since this is only a first outline I'd appreciate your feedback!
