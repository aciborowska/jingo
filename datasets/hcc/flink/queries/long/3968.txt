I am using a Mac with Chrome as my browser. I run a Flink job and when I look at the dashboard, there is no cancel button and I cannot scroll the page to the right on my Mac display(13"). But when I connect to a second monitor (24"), the button is visible. I presume this should be a rendering problem. The two screenshots one having the cancel button and the other missing the same - http://imgur.com/a/1nTSg.
