org.apache.flink.streaming.examples.windowing.TopSpeedWindowing.CarSource does not implement checkpointing of its state, namely the current speeds and distances per car. The main problem with this is that the window trigger only fires if the new distance has increased by at least 50 but after restore, it will be reset to 0 and could thus not produce output for a while.

Either the distance calculation could use Math.abs or the source needs proper checkpointing. Optionally with allowing the number of cars to increase/decrease.
