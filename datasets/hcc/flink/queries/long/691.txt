By creating the testcases for the cross operator I noticed that it is currently not possible to use cross on custom type objects.
The reason for that is that the two copy methods in the AvroSerializer are currently not implemented.
The same problem probably applies for the join operator.

I think this issue is quite critical. Testcases for the cross are already created (withoud warranty for correctness) but commented out.
