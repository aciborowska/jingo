If user use `flink run` to submit flink jars, he could build uber jar to include all its dependencies, but in flink scala-shell, there's no way to ship custom jars.Â  Currently `start-scala-shell -a <jars>` only put the jars on the classpath of client side, but doesn't ship it to yarn container. This make it impossible to use these jars in flink tasks.
