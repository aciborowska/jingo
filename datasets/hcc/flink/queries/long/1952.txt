Steps to reproduce

./bin/yarn-session.sh -n 350 


... wait until they are connected ...

Number of connected TaskManagers changed to 266. Slots available: 266
Number of connected TaskManagers changed to 323. Slots available: 323
Number of connected TaskManagers changed to 334. Slots available: 334
Number of connected TaskManagers changed to 343. Slots available: 343
Number of connected TaskManagers changed to 350. Slots available: 350


Start CC

./bin/flink run -p 350 ./examples/flink-java-examples-0.9-SNAPSHOT-ConnectedComponents.jar


---> it runs

Run KMeans, let it fail with 

Failed to deploy the task Map (Map at main(KMeans.java:100)) (1/350) - execution #0 to slot SimpleSlot (2)(2)(0) - 182b7661ca9547a84591de940c47a200 - ALLOCATED/ALIVE: java.io.IOException: Insufficient number of network buffers: required 350, but only 254 available. The total number of network buffers is currently set to 2048. You can increase this number by setting the configuration key 'taskmanager.network.numberOfBuffers'.


... as expected.

(I've waited for 10 minutes between the two submissions)

Starting CC now will fail:

./bin/flink run -p 350 ./examples/flink-java-examples-0.9-SNAPSHOT-ConnectedComponents.jar
