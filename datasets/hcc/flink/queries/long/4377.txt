Dear Team,
  I was trying to create a hash map with a size around 1 million. Then I encountered the below issue. For smaller maps, I am not seeing any issues.

akka.remote.OversizedPayloadException: Discarding oversized payload sent to Actor[akka.tcp://flink@localhost:58247/user/$d#458673459]: max allowed size 10485760 bytes, actual size of encoded class org.apache.flink.runtime.messages.JobManagerMessages$JobResultSuccess was 175254213 bytes.


Regards,
Sajeev
