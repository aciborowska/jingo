We've got a notification from Apache INFRA about a potential security vulnerability:


We found a potential security vulnerability in a repository for which you have been granted security alert access.
@apache 	apache/flink-web
Known high severity security vulnerability detected in yajl-ruby < 1.3.1 defined in Gemfile.
Gemfile update suggested: yajl-ruby ~> 1.3.1. 

This is a problem with the build environment of the website, i.e., this dependency is not distributed or executed with Flink but only run when the website is updated.

Nonetheless, we should of course update the dependency.
