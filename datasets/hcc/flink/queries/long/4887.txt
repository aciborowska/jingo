Instead of accessing directly on the ActorGateway in the Execution and ExecutionVertex it would be better to decouple the two components by introducing the TaskGateway interface which provides access to task related rpc calls. The ActorGateway could be one implementation of the interface.

This change will prepare the further implementation of Flip-6.
