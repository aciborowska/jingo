Can anybody confirm that this test is not working:

`mvn clean compile test -DfailIfNoTests=false -Dtest=CustomDataTypeTest`

The weird thing is that the test doesn't fail when the all tests are run, e.g. `mvn clean verify`.

I have an idea why this might happen. It would be nice though if someone could make sure that it is nothing local to my setup. After that I will try the fix.
