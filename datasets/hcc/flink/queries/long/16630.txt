 )





 [ERROR] Could not execute SQL statement. Reason: org.apache.flink.table.api.SqlParserException: SQL parse failed. Encountered "\'@version\'" at line 2, column 1. Was expecting one of: "PRIMARY" ... "UNIQUE" ... "WATERMARK" ... <BRACKET_QUOTED_IDENTIFIER> ... <QUOTED_IDENTIFIER> ... <BACK_QUOTED_IDENTIFIER> ...
