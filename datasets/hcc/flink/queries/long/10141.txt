With the changes around introducing credit-based flow control as well as the low latency changes, unfortunately, we also introduced some lock contention on RemoteInputChannel#bufferQueue and RemoteInputChannel#receivedBuffers as well as asking for queue sizes when the only thing we need is whether it is empty or not.

This was observed as a high idle CPU load with no events in the stream but only watermarks (every 500ms) and many slots on a single machine.
