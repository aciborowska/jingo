Currently, CoGroupStreams package the map/keyBy/window operators with a human friendly interface, like: dataStreamA.cogroup(streamB).where(...).equalsTo().window().apply(), both the intermediate operators and final window operators can not be accessed by users, and we cannot set attributes of the operators, which make co-group hard to use in production environment.
