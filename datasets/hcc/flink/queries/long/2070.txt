With the print() method printing on the client, the print(sourceIentified) method becomes confusing, as it has the same name, but prints on the taskManager (into its "out" files) and executes lazily.

We should clarify the confusion by picking a more descriptive name, like printOnTaskManager().

I am not sure how common the use case to print into the TaskManager out files is. We could remove that method and point to the PrintingOutputFormat for that.
