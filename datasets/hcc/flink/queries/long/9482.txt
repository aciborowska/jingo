Due to work on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-9432 I have faced with question how to check DECADE function with tests in

org/apache/flink/table/expressions/validation/ScalarFunctionsValidationTest.scala. 


Because I have used CENTURY function as an example, first of all I have check it. During the test I figured out that when we use it with TIME it returns 0.
I suppose arguments for such functions (also it works for YEAR, MONTH, MILLENNIUM, etc) need to be checked and throw some exception if type is not suitable.

As an example, in Apache Calcite project (checked in sqlline shell), when I am trying to use CENTURY with TIME it throw:


java.lang.AssertionError: unexpected TIME


Need to determine, why such check is not exists and add it.
