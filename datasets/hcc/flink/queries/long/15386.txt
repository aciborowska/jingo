	@Override
	public void putJobGraph(SubmittedJobGraph jobGraph) throws Exception {
		if (!jobGraph.getJobId().equals(jobGraph.getJobId())) { //this always returns false.
			throw new FlinkException("Cannot put additional jobs into this submitted job graph store.");

The code is there since 1.5 but fixed in the master branch (1.10). It's also better to add unit test for this.
