With FLINK-11159 we changed the signature of CompletedCheckpointStore#getLatestCheckpoint from getLatestCheckpoint() to getLatestCheckpoint(boolean). This is an API breaking change which causes users of this interface having to adapt their implementation and recompile it. Since CompletedCheckpointStore is no public API, this change is technically ok, but not so nice. 

If we decide to provide backwards compatibility, then we should still keep getLatestCheckpoint() and add a deprecation annotation to it. At least, we should update the JavaDocs of the CompletedCheckpointStore#getLatestCheckpoint method to reflect what the passed parameter states.
