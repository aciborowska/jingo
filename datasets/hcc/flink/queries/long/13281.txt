FLINK-13060 ensure FailoverStrategies should respect restart constraints. However, this change did not cover the AdaptedRestartPipelinedRegionStrategyNGAbortPendingCheckpointsTest which should also set as FixedDelayRestartStrategy. Currently, as the pending checkpoint would still be discarded due to failUnacknowledgedPendingCheckpoints within CheckpointCoordinator, AdaptedRestartPipelinedRegionStrategyNGAbortPendingCheckpointsTest could pass the test.

This is actually not what we want the test did, we should actually verify that when region failover, pending checkpoints would be discarded.
