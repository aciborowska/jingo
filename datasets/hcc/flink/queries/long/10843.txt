Currently, a user has to specify a specific version for a Kafka connector like:



connector:
  type: kafka
  version: "0.11"     # required: valid connector versions are "0.8", "0.9", "0.10", and "0.11"
  topic: ...          # required: topic name from which the table is read



However, the new Kafka connector aims to be universal, thus, at least for 1.x and 2.x versions which we should support those as parameters as well. Currently, 2.0 is the only accepted string for the factory.
