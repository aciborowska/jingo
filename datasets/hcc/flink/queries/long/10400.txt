If the job reaches the globally terminal state FAILED or CANCELED, the JobResult must return a non-successful result. At the moment, it can happen that in the CANCELED state where we don't find a failure cause that we return a successful JobResult.

In order to change this I propose to always return a JobResult with a JobCancellationException in case of CANCELED and a JobExecutionException in case of FAILED.
