Hadoop-common of 2.6 + version includes curator dependencies, which would have conflicts with the curator used by Flink runtime and cause test failures (the attachment is the surefire report). 

The curator dependencies tree of flink runtime is as below:

```

flink-shaded-hadoop2 -> hadoop-common -> curator-client & curator-recipes

flink-shaded-curator -> curator-recipes -> curator-framework -> curator-client

```

According to the dependency mechanism, maven would pick the curator-client in flink-shaded-hadoop2, and curator-framework and curator-recipes from flink-shaded-curator.

To fix the problem I think we can simply exclude curator-client from flink-shaded-hadoop2 dependency in flink-runtime.

I'd like to fix this, please let me know what you think. Thanks!
