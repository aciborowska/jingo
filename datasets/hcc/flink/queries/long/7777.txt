Currently, flink used japicmp-maven-plugin version is 0.7.0, I'm getting these warnings from the maven plugin during a mvn clean verify:

japicmp fixed in version 0.7.1 : _Excluded xerces vom maven-reporting dependency in order to prevent warnings from SAXParserImpl. _

The current stable version is 0.11.0, we can consider upgrading to this version.
