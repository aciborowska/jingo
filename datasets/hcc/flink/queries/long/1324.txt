This happens for example when a sort feeds into a merge join and the merge join exits early (zig zag merge determined that it can stop).

You can reproduce this bug by running the transitive closure in Scala (or Java with an enforced merge join) using the following toy data set.


Path(2, 1),
Path(4, 1),
Path(6, 3),
Path(8, 3),
Path(10, 1),
Path(12, 1),
Path(14, 3),
Path(16, 3),
Path(18, 1),
Path(20, 1) );
