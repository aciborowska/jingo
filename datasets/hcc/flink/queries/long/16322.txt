I get the wrong result when run the following query:

source schema:
first VARCHAR
id INT
score DOUBLE 
last VARCHAR

data: (parquet file is in the attachment)
("Mike", 1, 12.3d, "Smith"),
("Bob", 2, 45.6d, "Taylor"),
("Sam", 3, 7.89d, "Miller"),
("Peter", 4, 0.12d, "Smith"),
("Liz", 5, 34.5d, "Williams"),
("Sally", 6, 6.78d, "Miller"),
("Alice", 7, 90.1d, "Smith"),
("Kelly", 8, 2.34d, "Williams")

query:
SELECT id, `first`, `last`, score FROM ParquetTable WHERE score < 3

the expected result size is 2, however the actual result size is 0. 

If I disable filter push down, the result is correct. 
I think there are two bugs: 
the one is in ParquetTableSource#applyPredicate. AFAK, ParquetReader will filter the row groups based on statistics not filter the record. So the predicates passed to the applyPredicate method should not be removed.
Even if I fix the first bug, the result is also wrong. So I guess there may be a bug in other place.
