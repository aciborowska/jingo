There is currently a URL clash between the TaskManagersHandler and TaskManagerMetricsHandler, with both being routed to

/taskmanagers/:taskmanagerid/metrics


As a result it is not possible to query the full set of metrics for a taskmanager, but only the hard-coded subset that is displayed on the metrics tab on the taskmanager page.

This is a side-effect of 6d53bbc4b92e651786ecc8c2c6dfeb8e450a16a3 making the URL's more consistent. The TaskManager page in the web-interface has 3 tabs: Metrics, Log and Stdout.

The URLs for these tabs are

/taskmanager/<tmid>/metrics
/taskmanager/<tmid>/log
/taskmanager/<tmid>/stdout


which correspond to the REST URL's used. Previously, the metrics tab used 

/taskmanager/<tmid>


However, 70704de0c82cbb7b143dd696221e11999feb3600 then exposed the metrics gathered by the metrics system through the REST API. The assumption was that general information for the taskmanagers are retrieved via /taskmanager/<tmid>, similar to how the job-related URL's are structured, which sadly isn't the case.
