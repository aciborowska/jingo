Currently, if an exception arises in user supplied code within an operator in a streaming job, Flink terminates the job, but it fails to record the reason for the termination.  The logs do not record that there was an exception at all, much less recording the type of exception and where it occurred.  This makes it difficult to debug jobs without implementing exception recording code on all user supplied operators.
