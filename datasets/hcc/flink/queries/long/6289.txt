When calling `ExecutionEnvironment.readTextFile()` passing a ".gz" file as input, it deflates the file correctly. If I pass a directory as input, it reads the files contained in the directory. But If I pass a directory containing ".gz" files as input, it does not deflate the files and treat them as ASCII files.
