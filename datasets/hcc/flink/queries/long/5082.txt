The JobManager receives an ExecutorService to run its futures as a constructor parameter. Even though the ExecutorService comes from outside, the JobManager shuts the executor service down if the JobManager terminates. This is clearly a sub-optimal behaviour leading also to RejectedExecutionExceptions.

I propose to move the ExecutorService lifecycle management out of the JobManager.
