I am not sure if it is a known issue, but If we consider the following ```DataSet<Tuple2<Text,LongWritable>>``` named ```words``` with the content:

allen 1
allein 1
allein 1
a 1
word 1
word 1
words 1

and apply ```words.groupBy(0).reduceGroup(someReduceFunction)``` (for example one that sums values)





outputs:

a 1
words 3
words 3

The same occurs when we specify a custom ```KeySelector``` that transforms the Text to a String (thw whole key as String).
