Running tests through Maven locally, I encountered a timeout in 

MultiTriggerPolicyTest#testActiveTriggerRunnables

saying that it timed out after 10s.

I've looked into the code and saw that it is almost totally unrelated to the runtime. I therefore suspect that it was due to a system hickup. Could someone please confirm this and maybe increase the timeout?

In general, we should consider setting these timeouts rather high (due to Travis etc.)
