The windowing logic needs a major overhaul. This follows the design documents: 

	https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Time+and+Order+in+Streams
	https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=60624830



Specifically, the following shortcomings need to be addressed:


	Global parallel windows should be dropped
       -> for time, local windows are aligned and serve the same purpose
       -> there is currently no known robust and efficient parallel implementation of custom strategies 




	Event time and out of order arrival needs to be supported




	Eviction of not accessed keys does not work. Non-accessed keys linger infinitely




	Performance is currently bad for time windows, due to a overly general implementation




	Resources are leaking, threads are not shut down




	Elements are stored multiple times (discretizers, window buffers)




	Finally, many implementations are buggy, produce wrong results
