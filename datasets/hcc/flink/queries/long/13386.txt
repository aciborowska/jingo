While manually testing the new WebUI I found a few frictions.


	when using the UI the left panel hides unexpectedly at random moments
	mouse wheel does not work on the logs (taskmanager, jobmanager) pane
	the jobmanager configuration is not sorted
	different sorting of the operators (the old UI showed the sources first)
	the drop-down list for choosing operator/tasks metrics is not sorted, which makes it super hard to screen through available metrics
	arrow does not touch the rectangles in Chrome (see attached screenshot)



There are also some views missing in the new UI that I personally found useful in the old UI:

	can't see watermarks for all operators at once
	no numeric metrics (only graphs)
