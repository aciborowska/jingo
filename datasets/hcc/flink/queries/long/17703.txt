FLINK-17057 had some unfortunate side effects: by having the "include-netty-tcnative-dynamic" profile active by default, the "benchmark" profile was not active any more. Thus the following command that was typically used for running the benchmarks failed unless the "benchmark" profile was activated manually like this:


mvn -Dflink.version=1.11-SNAPSHOT clean package exec:exec -P benchmark
