File sources (such as ExecutionEnvironment#readCsvFile()) and sinks (such as FileOutputFormat and its subclasses, and methods such as DataSet#writeAsText()) need the ability to transparently decompress and compress files. Primarily gzip would be useful, but it would be nice if this were pluggable to support bzip2, xz, etc.

There could be options for autodetect (based on file extension and/or file content), which could be the default, as well as no compression or a selected compression method.
