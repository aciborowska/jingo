Flink uses either Path or URL to point to resources. For example,  JobGraph.addJar expects a Path while JobWithJars expects URLs for JARs.

The URL class requires an explicit file schema (e.g. file://, hdfs://) while the Path class expects any kind of well-formed paths. We should make clear which one to use for resources.
