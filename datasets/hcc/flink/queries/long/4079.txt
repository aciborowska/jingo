YARN per job clusters (flink run -m yarn-cluster) rely on the hidden YARN properties file, which defines the container configuration. This can lead to unexpected behaviour, because the per-job-cluster configuration is merged  with the YARN properties file (or used as only configuration source).

A user ran into this as follows:

	Create a long-lived YARN session with HA (creates a hidden YARN properties file)
	Submits standalone batch jobs with a per job cluster (flink run -m yarn-cluster). The batch jobs get submitted to the long lived HA cluster, because of the properties file.



Maximilian Michels Am I correct in assuming that this is only relevant for the 1.0 branch and will be fixed with the client refactoring you are working on?
