By default, Debezium will send two messages to Kafka for DELETE operation, one for delete message, the other for tombstone message (message value is null). However, debezium-json will throw NPE when processing such tombstone message. We should just skip such messages. 


As a workaround, we can diable tombstone on Debezium Connect tombstones.on.delete: false.
