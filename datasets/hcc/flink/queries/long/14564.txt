This report is based on a code review.  The scenario described is unlikely to happen in the wild.

Examining code lines 669 - 686 of ./bin/config.sh reveals, what I believe to be a design bug.  Presumably to speed up localhost launching, if ALL slaves are localhost then ssh isn't called but instead taskmanager.sh is called directly.  This seems like a bad idea:

	That instance will inherit environment variables from the current shell
	If a user specifies $FLINK_SSH_OPTS, they will not be honored in the "all local" case.



My request is that regardless of mode, taskmanager.sh is launched with the exact same environment.

If anyone also happens to be digging through that code, 'readSlaves' could be improved.  In addition to checking for 'localhost' and '127.0.0.1', it could also check for `hostname`
