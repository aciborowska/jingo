I start Flink by executing bin/yarn-session.sh.
To change the log levels of the Taskmanager, I have to edit conf/log4j.properties instead of conf/log4j-yarn-session.properties.
I have not found any documentation on this, but this seems like a bug to me.

The Taskmanager logs indicate that non-yarn configuration files are added to the classpath:

2016-10-01 13:22:19,267 INFO  org.apache.flink.yarn.YarnTaskManagerRunner                   -  Classpath: logback.xml:log4j.properties:lib/flink-dist_2.11-1.1.2.jar:lib/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.7.jar....

Or is there another usecase of the yarn logger config files?
