I created a csv table in sql client, and tried to insert some data into this table.

The first insert into success, but the second one failed with exception: 


// Caused by: java.io.IOException: File or directory /.../xxx.csv already exists. Existing files and directories are not overwritten in NO_OVERWRITE mode. Use OVERWRITE mode to overwrite existing files and directories.    at org.apache.flink.core.fs.FileSystem.initOutPathLocalFS(FileSystem.java:817)
