The checkpoint coordinator currently contains no tests and is vulnerable to a variety of situations. In particular, I propose to add:


	Better configurability which tasks receive the trigger checkpoint messages, which tasks need to acknowledge the checkpoint, and which tasks need to receive confirmation messages.




	checkpoint timeouts, such that incomplete checkpoints are guaranteed to be cleaned up after a while, regardless of successful checkpoints




	better sanity checking of messages and fields, to properly handle/ignore messages for old/expired checkpoints, or invalidly routed messages




	Better handling of checkpoint attempts at points where the execution has just failed is is currently being canceled.




	Add a good set of tests
