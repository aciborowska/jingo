I now recall why FLINK-3771 had a Translator interface with a translate method taking a field for reuse: when we translate edge ID the translator must be called twice.

TranslateFunction will be modeled after MapFunction and RichTranslateFunction will be modeled after RichMapFunction.

The unit test should have caught this but I was reusing values between fields which did not detect that values were overwritten.
