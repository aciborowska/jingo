As stated in the documentation this is how table functions should be used in Java Table API:


// Register the function.
tableEnv.registerFunction("split", new Split("#"));

myTable.join("split(a) as (word, length)");


However Table.join(String) was removed sometime ago and now it is impossible to use Table Functions in Java Table API.
