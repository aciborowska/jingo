A user reports CsvInputFormat cannot find the field of derived POJO class. (http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/flink-user/201509.mbox/%3cCAJ54yvi6CbLdN7cYpey+xe8a5A_J1-6Tnx1wm1Eb63gVnQd16w@mail.gmail.com%3e)

The reason of the bug is that CsvInputFormat uses getDeclaredField method without scanning base classes to find the field. When CsvInputFormat was wrote, TypeInformation cannot be serialized. So we needed to initialize TypeInformation in open method manually. Some mistakes in initializing cause this bug.

After FLINK-2637 is merged, we can serialize TypeInformation and don't need to create field objects in CsvInputFormat.
