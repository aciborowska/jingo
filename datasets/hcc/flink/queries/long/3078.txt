While testing the 0.10.1 release, I found that the JobManager does not shutdown when I'm stopping it while a streaming job is running.

It seems that the checkpoint coordinator and the execution graph are still logging, even though the JobManager actor system and other services have been shut down.

This is a log file of an affected JobManager: https://gist.github.com/rmetzger/a1532c18eb7081977cee
