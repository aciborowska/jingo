The ReduceTaskExternalITCase.testMultiLevelMergeCombiningReduceTask test failed with the following error


testMultiLevelMergeCombiningReduceTask[0](org.apache.flink.runtime.operators.ReduceTaskExternalITCase)  Time elapsed: 0.233 sec  <<< FAILURE!
java.lang.AssertionError: Invoke method caused exception.
	at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:88)

Here is the log https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/169181202/log.txt

Sadly, the test is not logging the exception at INFO level, so we can not really understand what's going on.

I'll push a commit improving the logging.
