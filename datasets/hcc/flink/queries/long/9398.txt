See: https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/4922ced71a307a26b9f5070b41f72fd5d93b0ac8/flink-clients/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/client/cli/CliFrontend.java#L437-L445

Seems like CLI command: flink list -r returns all jobs except jobs in CREATE state. which conflicts with the CLI description: Running/Restarting Jobs.
