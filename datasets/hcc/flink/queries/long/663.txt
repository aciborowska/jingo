Consider the following situation: the program DOP is 8; the last transformation is an all reduce (i.e. reduce without a grouping); after this, the result is written out.

How many files should this result in? I was expecting a single file, but found that it will create 8 files.

ATM I haven't checked if the sink still has a higher DOP or if there is a problem with the reduce op.
