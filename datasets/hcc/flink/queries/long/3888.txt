Contrary to the documentation the method to add an aggregator with a custom convergence criterion to a DeltaIteration is not exposed directly to DeltaIteration, but can only be accessed via the aggregatorRegistry.
Moreover, when registering an aggregator with a custom convergence criterion  and running the program, the following exception appears in the logs:

Error: Cannot use custom convergence criterion with workset iteration. Workset iterations have implicit convergence criterion where workset is empty.
org.apache.flink.optimizer.CompilerException: Error: Cannot use custom convergence criterion with workset iteration. Workset iterations have implicit convergence criterion where workset is empty.
