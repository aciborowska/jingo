The operator's latency time is increased by approximately 2.7 minutes per day (see the attached).
We compute the latency by System.currentTimeMillis - marker.getMarkedTime.
There is no guarantee that System.currentTimeMillis and System.nanoTime don't drift apart.
If a GC pause or linux preemptive scheduling happenes, this should affect latency metrics.
Latency metrics drift away from their initial values with time(verify this result via the JVM Heap Dump).
