The doc of class StreamTaskNetworkInput as follows 


* <p>Forwarding elements, watermarks, or status status elements must be protected by synchronizing
* on the given lock object. This ensures that we don't call methods on a
* {@link StreamInputProcessor} concurrently with the timer callback or other things.

 
 Is one of the 'status' redundant?
