In the method: 

public final void run(final SourceContext<OUT> ctx) throws Exception

The line:

this.spout.open(null,
				StormWrapperSetupHelper
				.convertToTopologyContext((StreamingRuntimeContext) super.getRuntimeContext(), true),
				new SpoutOutputCollector(this.collector));

Will cause a NullPointerException since the the first argument of spout.open cannot be null.  In Storm, this is where stormconfs are passed and the map that gets passed in is never null thus null is never checked.  I observed this problem when using a KafkaSpout in a Storm topology I am trying to run on top of flink.  I will have a fix for this soon
