I've implemented my own data type that represents a web document (URL, text content, some metadata).
When serializing this document into PactRecord I use writeUTF to write the text content.

I often encounter documents that are longer than 65535 bytes in UTF encoding.

https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/blob/master/pact/pact-common/src/main/java/eu/stratosphere/pact/common/type/PactRecord.java#L1564

What can I do to fix that?
