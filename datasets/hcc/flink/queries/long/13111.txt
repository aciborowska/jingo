So far I have followed the instructions documented for Flink's kinesis connector to use a local Kinesis. (Using Flink 1.8 and Kinesis connector 1.8)

https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/connectors/kinesis.html#using-non-aws-kinesis-endpoints-for-testing


Properties producerConfig = new Properties();
producerConfig.put(AWSConfigConstants.AWS_REGION, "us-east-1");
producerConfig.put(AWSConfigConstants.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, "aws_access_key_id");
producerConfig.put(AWSConfigConstants.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, "aws_secret_access_key");
producerConfig.put(AWSConfigConstants.AWS_ENDPOINT, "http://localhost:4567");

With a Flink producer, these instructions work with a local kinesis (I use Kinesalite).

However, with a Flink consumer, I get an exception that `aws.region` and `aws.endpoint` are not both allowed.

org.apache.flink.client.program.ProgramInvocationException: The main method caused an error: For FlinkKinesisConsumer either AWS region ('aws.region') or AWS endpoint ('aws.endpoint') must be set in the config.

Is this a bug in the connector? I found the PR which fixed this but maybe for only the producer https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6045 .

I found a [workaround on Flink's mailing list](http://apache-flink-user-mailing-list-archive.2336050.n4.nabble.com/Can-t-get-the-FlinkKinesisProducer-to-work-against-Kinesalite-for-tests-td23438.html), but their issue is with the producer rather than the consumer but perhaps they got that the wrong way around, it is after all weird how there are two codepaths for consumer/producer.
