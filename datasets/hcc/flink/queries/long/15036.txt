With FLINK-13184, we replaced the NMClient with the NMClientAsync. As part of this change, container start up errors are now handled by a callback to NMClientAsync.CallbackHandler. The implementation of NMClientAsync.CallbackHandler#onStartContainerError will be called by the NMClientAsync. Since the implementation does state changing operations, it needs to happen inside of the YarnResourceManager main thread.
