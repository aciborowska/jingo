i want to use CEP library  to do something with scala.  when use  notFollowedBy function,  it seems not like  other functions  like  next() and followedBy()  which return a Pattern object,  it return nothing. i assumes it is a bug.

in the source code ,the function in scala is below :


def notFollowedBy(name : String) {
    Pattern[T, T](jPattern.notFollowedBy(name))
  }



i think it should be :

def notFollowedBy(name : String) :Pattern[T, T]={
    Pattern[T, T](jPattern.notFollowedBy(name))
  }
