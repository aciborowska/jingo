First, some context about the job

	Flink 1.4.1
	stand-alone deployment mode
	embarrassingly parallel: all operators are chained together
	parallelism is over 1,000
	stateless except for Kafka source operators. checkpoint size is 8.4 MB.
	set "state.backend.fs.memory-threshold" so that only jobmanager writes to S3 to checkpoint
	internal checkpoint with 10 checkpoints retained in history

Summary of the observations

	41,567 ExecutionVertex objects retained 9+ GB of memory
	Expanded in one ExecutionVertex. it seems to storing the kafka offsets for source operator
