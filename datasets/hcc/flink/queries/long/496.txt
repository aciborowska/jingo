I'm currently trying to create some overview images for developers to give a quick initial overview of how different components of Stratosphere are working together.
The aim is to make it easier for new developers to get a general understanding of the overall architecture of the whole project and of single components.

I found it quite hard to find a good way of presentation, that's why I would appreciate some comments and suggestions.
My initial try can be found here: https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/wiki/DeveloperOverview
