The OrcRowInputFormat seems to use two different FileSystem. The Flink FileSystem for listing the files and generating the InputSplits and then Hadoop's FileSystem to actually read the input splits. This can be problematic if one only configures Flink's S3 FileSystem but does not provide a S3 implementation for Hadoop's FileSystem.

I think this is not an intuitive behaviour and can lead to hard to debug problems for a user.
