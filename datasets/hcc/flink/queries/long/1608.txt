The TaskManager uses a NetUtils routine to pick a network interface that lets it talk to the Jobmanager. However, if the JobManager is not online yet, the TaskManager falls back to an arbitrary non-localhost device.

In cases where the TaskManagers start faster than the JobManager, they may pick the wrong interface (and associated address and hostname)

The later logic (that tries to connect to the JobManager actor) does several retries. I think we need similar logic when looking for a suitable network interface to use.
