There is error with ipv6 addresses in flink-runtime/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/runtime/jobmanager/JobManager.scala:

  /**
   * Builds the akka actor path for the JobManager actor, given the socket address
   * where the JobManager's actor system runs.
   *
   * @param address The address of the JobManager's actor system.
   * @return The akka URL of the JobManager actor.
   */
  def getRemoteJobManagerAkkaURL(address: InetSocketAddress): String = {
    val hostPort = address.getAddress().getHostAddress() + ":" + address.getPort()
    s"akka.tcp://flink@$hostPort/user/$JOB_MANAGER_NAME"
  }


that leads to
