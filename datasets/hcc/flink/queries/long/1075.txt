I encountered a race condition in the AsynchronousPartialSorterITCase which causes the test to fail non-deterministically. The sorter is legacy code and is only needed in the GroupReduceCombinerDriver. [~StephanEwen] proposed to replace the code in the GroupReduceCombineDriver and to delete the AsynchronousPartialSorter.
