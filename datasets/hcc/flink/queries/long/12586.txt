In OptimizerPlanEnvironment#getOptimizedPlan method, it looks like that stdout is output as System.err and stderr is output as System.out.

I think, It should be like as bellow.


throw new ProgramInvocationException(

"The program plan could not be fetched - the program aborted pre-maturely."

+ "\n\nSystem.err: " + (stdout.length() == 0 ? "(none)" : stderr)

+ "\n\nSystem.out: " + (stderr.length() == 0 ? "(none)" : stdout));
