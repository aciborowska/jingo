When not setting a state backend in the config the savepoint coordinator defaults to use "jobmanager" as savepoint backend, ignoring the setting for the savepoint backend in the config.

This means that when setting a StateBackend only per job the system always falls back to "jobmanager" even though it could use "filesystem" to make savepoints persistent.
