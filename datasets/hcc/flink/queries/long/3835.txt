The JSON execution plans are not helpful when debugging plans that include join operators with key selectors. For joins with hash join strategy, the driver strategy shows: "Hybrid Hash (build: Key Extractor)" where (build: Key Extractor) shall help to identify the build side of the join. However, if both inputs use KeySelectors, the build side cannot be identified.

I propose to add the operator id to the build side information. The same issue applied for cross driver strategies.
