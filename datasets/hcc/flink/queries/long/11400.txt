The JobManagerRunner does not wait for the suspension of the JobMaster to finish before granting leadership again. This can lead to a state where the JobMaster tries to start the ExecutionGraph but the SlotPool is still stopped.

I suggest to linearize the leadership operations (granting and revoking leadership) similarly to the Dispatcher.
