The first prototype consists of a small python- and java-framework, which can currently work with an Reduce and Map-Operator and sent over sockets and stdio. Google Protocol Buffers are used to send records between the java and python processes. 

This commit also includes an running-wordcount example. The UDFs can be defined in python, while the configuration and Plan-setup still has to be made in java.
