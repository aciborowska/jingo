The PojoSerializer contains a list of pojo fields which are represented as Field instances. Upon serialization the names of these fields are serialized. When being deserialized these names are used to look up the respective Fields of a dynamically loaded class. If the dynamically loaded class has additional fields (compared to when the serializer was serialized), then these fields will be ignored (for the read and for the write path). While this is necessary to read stored data, it is dangerous when writing new data, because all newly added fields won't be serialized. This subtleness is really hard to detect for the user. Therefore, I think we should eagerly fail if the newly loaded type contains new fields which haven't been present before.
