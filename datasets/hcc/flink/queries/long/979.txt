The refactoring of the scheduler and the JobGraph broke the NetworkThroughput test.


21:50:27,199 ERROR eu.stratosphere.nephele.client.JobClient                      - ERROR: eu.stratosphere.nephele.executiongraph.GraphConversionException: java.lang.RuntimeException: No input format has been set for job vertex: 35414f433c65380065e604fcce42b800



The test has been modifed during the merge to use a plain JobInputVertex instead of the previous GenericJobInputVertex, which worked without an InputFormat. With JobInputVertex we need to specify a dummy InputFormat.

The test does not startup (just a local executor is started and shutdown) and we don't see an error during mvn verify.
