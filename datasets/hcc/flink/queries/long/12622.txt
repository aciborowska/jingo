The process function defined as below in windows.md : 

class MyProcessWindowFunction extends ProcessWindowFunction[(String, Long), String, String, TimeWindow] {

  def process(key: String, context: Context, input: Iterable[(String, Long)], out: Collector[String]): () = {
    var count = 0L
    for (in <- input) 
Unknown macro: {
      count = count + 1
    } 
    out.collect(s"Window ${context.window} count: $count")
  }
}

Error:(37, 109) '=>' expected but '=' found.
