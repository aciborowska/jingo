This fixes a bug, where tests in `pact-tests` using `Tuple` or `IntTupleDataInFormat` would throw `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` on input > 32 KB.

I used TPCH-9 query from `pact-tests` to reliably reproduce the multiplexing deadlock (see issue (#20 | FLINK-20)) even on small scale (because of the relatively long processing pipeline).
