The TaskExecutor does not properly wait for the termination of Tasks when terminating. In fact, it does not even trigger the cancellation of the running Tasks. I think for better lifecycle management it is important that the TaskExecutor triggers the termination of all running Tasks and then wait until all Tasks have terminated before it terminates itself.
