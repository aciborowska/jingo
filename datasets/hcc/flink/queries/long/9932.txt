When task executor offer slot to job master, it will first mark the slot as active.

If the offer slot call timeout, the task executor will try to call offerSlotsToJobManager again,

but it will only offer the slot in ALLOCATED state. As the slot has already be mark ACTIVE, it will never be offered and this will cause slot leak.
