Outer joins with non-equality predicates (and at least one equality predicate) compute incorrect results. 

Since this is not a very common requirement, I propose to disable this feature for the 1.2.0 release and correctly implement it for a later version.

The fix should add checks in the Table API validation phase (to get a good error message) and in the DataSetJoinRule to prevent translation of SQL queries with non-equality predicates on outer joins.
