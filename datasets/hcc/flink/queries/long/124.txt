I have a new example job to calculate a transitive closure (both java and scala frontend) where I have a union of the iteration input after using the input earlier. The udf with the union will just stall and nothing will happen. It does not happen when I unroll the iteration and it does also not happen when I emulate the reducer that has the union using a CoGroup.
