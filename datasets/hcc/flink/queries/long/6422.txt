Here is related code:


    if (minNumSplits < 1) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Number of input splits has to be at least 1.");
    }
...
    final long maxSplitSize = (minNumSplits < 1) ? Long.MAX_VALUE : (totalLength / minNumSplits +
          (totalLength % minNumSplits == 0 ? 0 : 1));


minNumSplits wouldn't be less than 1 getting to the assignment of maxSplitSize.
