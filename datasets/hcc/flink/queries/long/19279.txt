Currently we cache the provided universe, per JVM. The cache exists to avoid scanning the class path, whenever accessing the universe across different operators executing at the same JVM, however:

	Each operator access the universe during its open phase.
	Having such a cache result in a shared universe across attempts, and this is undesirable. For example accessing previously released resources.
