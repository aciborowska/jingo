I discovered the following problem while writing a low-level task: the scheduler could not bring up the instance for `forwarder3` (state `SCHEDULED`, but not `ASSIGNED`).
```
producer => forwarder0 => forwarder1 => forwarder2 => forwarder3 => consumer
```
```java
producer.setVertexToShareInstancesWith(forwarder0);
forwarder0.setVertexToShareInstancesWith(forwarder1);
forwarder1.setVertexToShareInstancesWith(forwarder2);
forwarder2.setVertexToShareInstancesWith(forwarder3);
forwarder3.setVertexToShareInstancesWith(consumer);
```
Every task should share the vertex. The following equivalent sharing did work though:
```
forwarder0   ================> producer 
forwarder1   ===// // // //
forwarder2   =====// // //
forwarder3   =======// //
consumer     =========//
```
```java
forwarder0.setVertexToShareInstancesWith(producer);
forwarder1.setVertexToShareInstancesWith(producer);
forwarder2.setVertexToShareInstancesWith(producer);
forwarder3.setVertexToShareInstancesWith(producer);
consumer.setVertexToShareInstancesWith(producer);
```
