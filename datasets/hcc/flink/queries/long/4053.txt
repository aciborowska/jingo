In RMQSource.java and RMQSink.java, there is code in the following pattern:

      connection = factory.newConnection();
      channel = connection.createChannel();


According to https://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-java-client/current-javadoc/com/rabbitmq/client/Connection.html#createChannel() :

a new channel descriptor, or null if none is available


The return value should be checked against null.
