InÂ FLINK-12362, "-n" is removed which cause unable to set container number for scala shell in yarn mode. The root cause is that start-scala-shell didn't use `flink run` which means it doesn't support all the parameters of flink run (including -p). 

Either we need to revert FLINK-12362, or make start-scala-shell use `flink run`
