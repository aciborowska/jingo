The code example for "Managed Operator State"  (https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.4/dev/stream/state/state.html#using-managed-operator-state) refers to the CheckpointedRestoring interface which was removed in Flink 1.4.0.

The example must be updated and the interface be removed.
