Hello!

If I use the `where` function with a field list during a join, it exhibits strange behavior.

Here is the sample code that triggers the error: https://gist.github.com/balidani/d9789b713e559d867d5c

This example joins a DataSet with itself, then counts the number of rows. If I use `.where(0, 1)` the result is (22), which is not correct. If I use `EdgeKeySelector`, I get the correct result (101).

When I pass a field list to the `equalTo` function (but not `where`), everything works again.

If I don't include the `groupBy` and `reduceGroup` parts, everything works.

Also, when working with large DataSets, passing a field list to `where` makes it incredibly slow, even though I don't see any exceptions in the log (in DEBUG mode).

Does anybody know what might cause this problem?

Thanks!
