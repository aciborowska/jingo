With FLINK-15827 we deprecated unused TaskManagerOptions. As part of this deprecation, we added them as deprecated keys for a couple of ClusterOptions. The problem is that the deprecated keys are of type Duration whereas the valid options are of type Long. Hence, the system will fail if a deprecated config option has been configured because it cannot be parsed as a long.

In order to solve the problem, I propose to remove the deprecated keys from the new ClusterOptions.
