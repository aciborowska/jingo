Savepoint compatibility table is outdated, does not cover 1.4.x nor 1.5.x. We should either update it or remove it, as I think we agreed to support only two versions backward compatibility and such table is unnecessary.

You can check the table in version 1.5.x here: https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.5/ops/upgrading.html#compatibility-table
