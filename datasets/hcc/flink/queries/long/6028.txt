If in main I have some code like this:


x.filter(t -> !t.f0.isEmpty())
    .flatMap((t, out) -> out.collect(new Tuple3<>(t.f1, t.f2, t.f3)))
    .writeAsText(filename, WriteMode.OVERWRITE).setParallelism(1);



In the log, the origin of these unnamed operations shows up as "main(null:-1)":


CHAIN Filter (Filter at main(null:-1)) -> FlatMap (FlatMap at main(null:-1))(2/2) switched to SCHEDULED 



However, operations inside lambdas seem to correctly provide the class name and line number in the logs, e.g. "Main.java:217".
