The CEP operator don't properly advance time in case of watermarks. Arriving watermarks should trigger the triggering of timeouts and pruning of event sequences. However, this works only if an element has arrived in the meantime. This is a bug and the time should also be advanced in case that no element arrived before the watermark.
