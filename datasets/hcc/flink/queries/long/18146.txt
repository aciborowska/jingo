The note ofÂ 

StreamingJobGraphGenerator#createJobGraph in line 160 has a misspelling.


private JobGraph createJobGraph() {
...
// Generate deterministic hashes for the nodes in order to identify them across
// submission iff they didn't change.
Map<Integer, byte[]> hashes = defaultStreamGraphHasher.traverseStreamGraphAndGenerateHashes(streamGraph);
...
}


Is 'iff' should be 'if'?
