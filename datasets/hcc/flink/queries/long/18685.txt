Steps to reproduce:


JobClient client = env.executeAsync("Test");

CompletableFuture<JobStatus> status = client.getJobStatus();
LOG.info("status = " + status.get());

CompletableFuture<Map<String, Object>> accumulators = client.getAccumulators(StreamingJob.class.getClassLoader());
LOG.info("accus = " + accumulators.get(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS));



Actual behavior
The accumulators future will never complete for a streaming job when calling this just in your main() method from the IDE.

Expected behavior
Receive the accumulators of the running streaming job.
The JavaDocs of the method state the following: "Accumulators can be requested while it is running or after it has finished.". 
While it is technically true that I can request accumulators, I was expecting as a user that I can access the accumulators of a running job.
Also, I can request accumulators if I submit the job to a cluster.
