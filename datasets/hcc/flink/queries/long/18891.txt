Run a flink stream sql job via yarn-per-job mode, flink-conf.yaml like below:


execution.target: yarn-per-job
restart-strategy: fixed-delay
restart-strategy.fixed-delay.attempts: 3
restart-strategy.fixed-delay.delay: 2s


 

After restarting job 3 times, the flink job status is FAILED, but yarn application state is still Running. Should the yarn application state be Finished when flink job FAILED? Thanks.
