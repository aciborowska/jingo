If the job submission, i.e. DispatcherGateway#submitJob fails with a JobSubmissionException the JobSubmissionHandler returns "Internal server error" instead of signaling the failed job submission.

This can for example occur if the transmitted execution graph is faulty, as tested by the JobSubmissionFailsITCase.
