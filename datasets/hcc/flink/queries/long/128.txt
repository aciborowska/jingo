Hi guys,

I'm trying to create the homework assignment for my course and as example I wanted to write a PACT job that computes the degree distribution of a graph (=how many vertices have outdegree x). The input is a file with "source target" ids per line. 

I have a Map that parses the data and emits (vertexID, 1), then a reduce that sums up the degree per vertexID and emits (degree, 1). The last reduce sums up the counts per degree and emits (degree, count) pairs. Unfortunately, I see duplicates in the output... I checked my code but can't see any problem. It would be super important for me to have this fixed soon.

Here's the code:
