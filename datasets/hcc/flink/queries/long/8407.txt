Partitioning operations (shuffle, rescale, etc.) for a DataStream create new DataStreams, which allow the users to set parallelisms for them. However, the PartitionTransformations in these returned DataStreams will only add virtual nodes, whose parallelisms could not be specified, in the execution graph. We should forbid users to set the parallelism after a partitioning operation since they won't actually work. Also the corresponding documents should be updated.
