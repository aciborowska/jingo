The AbstractServerBase does not wait for the completion of its shutdown when calling AbstractServerBase#shutdown. This is problematic since it leads to resource leaks and instable tests such as the AbstractServerTest. I propose to let the AbstractServerBase#shutdown return a termination future which is completed upon shutdown completion.
