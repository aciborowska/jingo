I created a log4j.properties and packaged it in source/main/resources of my Job jar. As per the documentation I added env.java.opts="-Dlog4j.configuration=log4j.properties" to my flink-conf.yaml. When I submit my job to the Flink yarn cluster, it does not pick up this log4j.properties. 

Observations:
The JVM options in the JobManager logs seem to have both the below, with the latter overriding what I specified ? I tried altering the flink-daemon.sh from adding the log settings, but it still shows up. 


-Dlog4j.configuration=log4j.properties
-Dlog4j.configuration=file:log4j.properties
