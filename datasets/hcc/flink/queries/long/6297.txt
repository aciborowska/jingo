-TimeoutPattern does not trigger under certain conditions. Following are the preconditions: 

-Assume a pattern of Event A followed by Event B within 2 Seconds

-PeriodicWaterMarks every 1 second

-Assume following events have arrived. 

-Event A-1[time: 1 sec]

-Event B-1[time: 2 sec] 

-Event A-2[time: 2 sec]

-Event A-3[time: 5 sec] 

-WaterMark[time: 5 sec]

I would assume that after watermark arrival, Event A-1,B-1 detected. A-2 timed out. But A-2 timeout does not happen.

if i use a punctuated watermark and generate watermark for every event, it seems to work as expected.
