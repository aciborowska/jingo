When a record is saved to Cassandra it may return a ResultSet to the callback given in the saveAsync; e.g. when we do INSERT ... IF NOT EXISTS, a ResultSet is returned with column applied: false if the record exists and the new record has not been inserted. Thus, we loose data in such case. 

The minimal solution would be to log the result. The best solution would be to add possibility of passing a custom callback; in this way we could deal with a success or failure in more custom way.  Other solution is to add a possibility to pass onSuccess and onFailure functions, which would be executed inside the callback.
