We currently run all Travis profiles with -Pinclude-kinesis even though some of the build profiles don't contain the Kinesis connector module. Morever, we run every build profile with -Pskip-webui-build even though flink-runtime-web is not built by every profile. This causes Maven to log:



19:15:47.404 [WARNING] The requested profile "skip-webui-build" could not be activated because it does not exist.
19:15:47.404 [WARNING] The requested profile "include-kinesis" could not be activated because it does not exist.



I think it would be good to keep the build on Travis in sync with the actual module structure and not specifying options for module where they are superfluous. This might prevent the accidental shadowing/inclusion of modules if the profiles change in the future.
