The description of dispatcher is like below:

The Dispatcher provides a REST interface to submit Flink applications for execution and starts a new JobManager for each submitted job. It also runs the Flink WebUI to provide information about job executions.

 

As I understand it, is it "starts a new JobMaster" rather than JobManager?
