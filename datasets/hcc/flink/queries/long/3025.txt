In some cases the Flink kafka consumer might fail due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-824.

Subsequently it can happen that the sources gets stuck in a Zookeeper client call (zookeeper bug).

A proposed fix would be bumping the zookeeper dependency to a version that includes the fix for this bug.
