The JobManager.cancelAndClearEverything method fails all currently executed jobs on the JobManager and then clears the list of currentJobs kept in the JobManager. This can become problematic if the user has set a restart strategy for a job, because the RestartStrategy will try to restart the job. This can lead to unwanted re-deployments of the job which consumes resources and thus will trouble the execution of other jobs. If the restart strategy never stops, then this prevents that the ExecutionGraph from ever being properly terminated.
