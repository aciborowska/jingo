Currently, once we receive an ERROR event that is sent from the K8s API server via the K8s Watcher, then KubernetesResourceManager#onError will handle it by calling the KubernetesResourceManager#removePodIfTerminated. This may be incorrect since the ERROR event may indicate an exception in the HTTP layer, which means the previously createdÂ Watcher may be no longer available and we'd better re-create the Watcher immediately.
