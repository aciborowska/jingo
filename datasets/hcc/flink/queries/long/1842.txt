I noticed that I had 12 dead java processes consuming 2 GB memory on my machine which weren't shown using jps. It turned out that all of them were ApplicationMaster processes. I suspect that this is the ApplicationMaster belonging to the YARNSessionFIFOITCase test case and that the ApplicationMaster is not properly shutdown after the tests.

In order to not pollute the developer's system, it would be good to properly terminate all YARN components.
