When using a filesystem backend, the 'StateBackendLoader' class produces a log message stating: "State backend is set to heap memory". 

Example:

2018-04-04 00:45:49,591 INFO  org.apache.flink.streaming.runtime.tasks.StreamTask           - State backend is set to heap memory (checkpoints to filesystem "hdfs://hdfs:8020/flink/checkpoints")

It looks like this resulted from some copy-pasta of the previous case-statement that matches on the memory backend. This bug is also present in earlier releases (1.3.2, 1.4.0) of Flink in the 'AbstractStateBackend' class.

This log statement should be corrected to indicate that a filesystem backend is in use.
