When a subtask is restored from a checkpoint that does not contain any state (e.g. because the subtask did not write state in the previous run), the result of StateInitializationContext::isRestored will incorrectly return false.

We should ensure that empty state is somehow reflected in a checkpoint and return true on restore, independent from the presence of state.
