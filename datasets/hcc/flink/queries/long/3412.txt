I think the implicit conversions between the Java DataStream and the Scala DataStream are dangerous.

Because conversions exist in both directions, it is possible to write methods that look like calling functions on the JavaStream, but instead convert it to a Scala stream and call a different method.
I just accidentally implemented an infinite recursion that way (via two hidden implicit conversions).

Making the conversions explicit (with a wrap() function like in the batch API, we add minimally more code internally (nothing is different for users), but avoid such accidental errors.
