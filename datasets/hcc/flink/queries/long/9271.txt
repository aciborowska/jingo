Hi,

I've just downloaded "Flink Without Hadoop" from http://flink.apache.org/downloads.html.

The name of the downloaded file is "flink-1.4.2-bin-scala_2.11.tgz" but trying to unpack it fails with:


tar zxvf flink-1.4.2-bin-scala_2.11.tgz 

gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
tar: Child returned status 1
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now





file flink-1.4.2-bin-scala_2.11.tgz                                                                                                                                       
flink-1.4.2-bin-scala_2.11.tgz: POSIX tar archive (GNU)



I'd suggest to rename the artefact to flink-1.4.2-bin-scala_2.11.tar to make it more clear what is inside and how to unpack it.
