We currently have some test cases which rely on non-deterministic behaviour. For example the JobManagerItCase contains a test case with a SometimesExceptionSender which randomly throws an exception and otherwise blocks. The probability of a failure is 0.05 and we have 100 parallel tasks. Thus, the overall probability that no task fails at all is still 0.005. Thus every 200th test run, the test case will block and thus fail.

In order to get a stable test case base, I think that we should try to avoid these kind of test cases with random behaviour. The same goes with sleep timeouts in order to "establish" an intended interleaving of concurrent processes. With Travis this can fail too often.
