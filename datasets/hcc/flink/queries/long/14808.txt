In ClientUtils.executeProgram, it create a new userCodeClassLoader and set it to thread context. (Name it cl1).

But in PackagedProgram, it use a different class loader to create user Class. (Name it cl2).

So in user's code,  if user use thread loader to create a class, this class is come from cl1, if user want to work this class with their own class, there should be a failure, because them come from different class loader.
