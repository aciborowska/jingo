The iteration head task is chained/merged with the first step function operator, if possible, to reduce the number of channels and threads. This is however, only possible in certain (yet common) situations.

Currently, the head is erroneously merged with the operator, even the initial partial solution (or workset) and the later partial solution (or workset) have different local strategies at that operator. Add a condition in the job graph generation to prevent this situation.

Note: This fixes the CoGroupConnectedComponents test.
