Hi Team,

Here is, what i am looking for:

	We have  flink HA dockerized cluster with (3 zookeepers, 2 job-managers, 3 task-managers) 
	So whenever we are cancelling the flink job, it is getting cancelled but it is not deleting the cancelled job ID from the zookeeper metadata (Inside flink/jobgraph folder in zookeeper) automatically. 
	So whenever any one of the job-manager goes down/restarted , it doesn't come up and throws exception like  "Could not find this job id xxxxxxxxxx".
	The current work around is to remove the canceled job ID from the zookeeper metadata manually. (But this is not the recommended solution).     



 

Please advise.
