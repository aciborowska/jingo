I am running flink locally on Windows as per instructions specified in theÂ link documentation 

flink version: 1.6.1

The job i am running is the Sample Job (https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.6/quickstart/setup_quickstart.html#read-the-code).

I am also configuring a logstash appender (logstash-logback-encoder) in order to send the logs to a logstash instance running locally along with console and file appenders.

When i run this flink job from my IDE, the logs are sent successfully to my logstash instance. However when i submit the same job to my flink cluster, i don't see any logs on logstash. Neither do i see any error indicating any failure to create the logstash appender.

I am pretty sure the logstash appender works fine since it works when i run the job from IDE. As per the link Best Practices, Flink uses log4j by default and needs to be configured to use logback. Does this apply to flink logs as in Taskmanager and jobmanager logs or to application logs? 

Is flink ignoring the logback.xml file that gets packaged in my jar? How to get flink to use the logback configuration that is included in the jar?
