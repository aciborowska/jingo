I have a Stratosphere job that has jodatime as a dependency. It seems that for our hadoop-yarn build, pact-hbase pulls jruby-complete.jar as a dependency. Jodatime is extracted into jruby-complete.
If I call a yodatime function inside my user code, the wrong (outdated) version is called, which causes an exception.

I think we need to configure the classloader in the TaskManager properly.
