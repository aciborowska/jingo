In stratosphere-sopremo we consider removing JDK 1.6 compatibility. One thing less to worry about.

While stratopshere-sopremo could throw out support for 1.6 it does not make sense to do so, if Stratosphere retains support for 1.6.
It would be incoherent and in the worst case, people run Stratosphere with 1.6 on one system, Sopremo with 1.7 on another and don't understand why things stop working.

So, Sopremo can only stop supporting 1.6 if Stratosphere does the same, hence this issue.

I created my pro/con list, feel free to comment:

Pro:
+ one JDK version means easier maintanance
+ we can finally use all the Java 7 features
+ Oracle doesn't provide patches anymore for JDK 1.6 [citation needed] (apparently it does for paying customers)

Con:

	raised barrier of entry, there may be people who just didn't bother to update to 1.7 even though they could have
	use of Stratosphere may be even impossible for some users because the can't switch to 1.7 for whatever reason



[Disclaimer] I just moved this discussion to an issue, so everyone can participate, don't kill the messenger :-P
