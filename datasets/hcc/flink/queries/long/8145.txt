In various tests, e.g. AsynchronousBufferFileWriterTest, BufferFileWriterReaderTest, or HashTableITCase, IOManagerAsync instances are used which are not shut down at all. The only thing cleaning them up seems to be a shutdown handler attached to the JVM. Since each IOManagerAsync is spawning a number of reader and writer threads, this may put a significant burden on the tests.
