One of my builds failed with
Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.17:test (default-test) on project flink-streaming-core: ExecutionException: java.lang.RuntimeException: The forked VM terminated without properly saying goodbye. VM crash or System.exit called?

Here's the build: https://travis-ci.org/apache/flink/jobs/73851870
This looks like a travis hiccup though, similar to how tachyon fails sometimes.
