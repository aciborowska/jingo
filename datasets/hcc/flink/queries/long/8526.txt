The next program attached will stuck at some special parallelism in some situation. When parallelism is 80 in previous setting, The program will always stuck. And when parallelism is 100, everything goes well.  According to my research I found when the parallelism equals to number of taskslots. The program is not fastest and probably caused network buffer not enough. How networker buffer related to parallelism and  how parallelism relate to running task (In other words we have 160 taskslots but running task can be far more than taskslots). 

Parallelism cannot be equals to half of the cpu.

Or will casuse "java.io.FileNotFoundException". You can repeat exception on your pc and set your parallelism equals to half of your cpu core.
