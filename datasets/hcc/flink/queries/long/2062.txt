The config parameter that defines the size of memory segments is called taskmanager.network.bufferSizeInBytes. Since it affects more than the network (it also affects the managed memory for operators like sort and hash), we should rename it to taskmanager.memory.segment-size

I think the coming release is a good opportunity to fix this.
