Initialization of input and output channels has been moved with 2db78a8dc1a4664f3e384005d7e07bea594b835b from `RuntimeEnvironment` to `initializeChannels(GateDeploymentDescriptor)` in InputGate and OutputGate respectively.

When creating a channel, `getChannelType()` of the abstract `Gate` class is called instead of the respective descriptor method, which should actually be called:

```
this.channels[i] = new OutputChannel(this, i, id, connectedId, getChannelType());
```

`getChannelType()` of `Gate` returns `ChannelType.NETWORK`, hence currently all channels are of type `ChannelType.NETWORK`.

This introduces runtime lookups of channel receivers in `ChannelManager` as `ChannelManager.register(Task)` does not add them at task registration.
