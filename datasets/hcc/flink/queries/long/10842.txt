There are 3 loops in flink-end-to-end-tests/test-scripts/common.sh where the script waits for some event to happen (for i in {1..10}; do):

	wait_dispatcher_running
	start_and_wait_for_tm
	wait_job_running



All loops have 10 iterations and the loop breaks if the awaited event happens. If timeout occurs then the script does not fail and the function just continues after 10 iterations ignoring that the awaited event did not happen.
