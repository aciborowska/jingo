(1)When using the following command:    
bin/yarn-session.sh -n 3 -z YARN1
to point out zookeeper namespace and then using bin/flink run to submit a job like this: 
bin/flink run examples/streaming/WindowJoin.jar   

the job could not find the JobManager.  

when using "flink run" and detect there is a properites file existing, user gets a FlinkYarnSessionCli, and when "retrieveCluster()" using FlinkYarnSessionCi, zkNamespace is set value accroding to "yz" option or application ID. If user doesn't using -yz, zkNamespace is set to application ID, and there is no information in Zookeeper under the fold "application ID"(already set according to -z in yarn-session.sh). 
(2)But when using -yz, FlinkYarnSessionCli's isActive() will return false because of loadYarnPropertiesFile() method seems to only allow using DETACHED option. User will get a standlone client
(3)When using -z, FlinkYarnSessionCli will not recognize the option because that CliFrontend has already set FlinkYarnsessionCli's shortPrefix to "y" and only recognizes "-y*" options
