When you are preparing to do a Flink framework version upgrading by using the strategy shadow copy , you have to run multiple clusters concurrently,  however when you are ready to stop the old version cluster after upgrading, you would find the stop-cluster.sh wouldn't work as you expected, the following is the steps to duplicate the issue:

	There is already a running Flink 1.5.x cluster instance;
	Installing another Flink 1.6.x cluster instance at the same cluster machines;
	Migrating the jobs from Flink 1.5.x  to Flink 1.6.x ;
	go to the bin dir of the Flink 1.5.x cluster instance and run stop-cluster.sh ;



You would expect the old Flink 1.5.x cluster instance be stopped ,right? Unfortunately the stopped cluster is the new installed Flink 1.6.x cluster instance instead!
