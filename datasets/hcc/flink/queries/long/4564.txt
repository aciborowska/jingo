Currently, the delimiter used or the scope string is based on a configuration setting shared by all reporters. However, different reporters may have different requirements in regards to the delimiter, as such we should allow reporters to use a different delimiter.

We can keep the current setting as a global setting that is used if no specific setting was set.
