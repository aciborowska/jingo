I notice that classes like BinaryRowData use de-/serialization method of MemorySegment without explicit endianness, I think this is not safe if we serialize some data on one machine and deserialize on another machine with different endianness. To be one the safe side, I think we should use de-/serialization method of MemorySegment with explicit endianness. What do you think? (BinaryRowWriter may have the same issue and there may be some other classes also suffer from this but I did not notice)
