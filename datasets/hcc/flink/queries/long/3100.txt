On a regular cluster shutdown, the following messages are printed in the jobmanager/taskmanager log:


16:03:22,877 ERROR org.apache.flink.runtime.jobmanager.JobManager - RECEIVED SIGNAL 15: SIGTERM
16:03:22,878 ERROR org.apache.flink.runtime.jobmanager.JobManager - This JVM will shut down because it was killed from the outside.



The log level ERROR is not correct and tools which rely on checking the log for errors and exceptions choke on this.
