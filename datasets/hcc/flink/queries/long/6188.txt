Recent changes done for FLINK-5808 move default parallelism manifestation from eager to lazy, that is, the parallelism of operations that don't have an explicit parallelism is only set when generating the JobGraph. Some setParallelism() calls, such as SingleOutputStreamOperator.setParallelism() cannot deal with the fact that the parallelism of an operation might be -1 (which indicates that it should take the default parallelism when generating the JobGraph).

We should either revert the changes that fixed another user-facing bug for version 1.2.1 or fix the methods.
