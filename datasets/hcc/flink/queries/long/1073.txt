Flink supports sorted input for GroupReduce operators by calling for example


myData.groupBy(1).sortGroup(2, Order.ASCENDING).reduceGroup(new MyReducer());



This code will sort the input of the function MyReducer.reduce() on the third field.
However, the input of MyReducer.combine() is not sorted, which is an  unexpected behavior, IMO.
