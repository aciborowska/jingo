The instructions here:

https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.8/dev/connectors/kinesis.html

say to use the following commands to build and install Flink with the Kinesis connector:

mvn clean install -Pinclude-kinesis -DskipTests

cd flink-dist

mvn clean install -Pinclude-kinesis -DskipTests

There is no longer a profile called "include-kinesis"; the docs should say the following instead, which seems to work:

cd flink-connectors/flink-connector-kinesis

{{mvn clean install -DskipTests }}
