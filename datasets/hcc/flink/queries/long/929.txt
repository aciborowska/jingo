I discovered the following by using the new Java-API:

When calling getDouble on the configuration given to the open method, the returned value is always the default value.
It seems like an override of getDouble is missing in the class TaskConfig.DelegatingConfiguration.

MyClass.java
//[...]
public void open(Configuration parameters) throws Exception
{
    //This seems to always return the default value
    parameters.getDouble("myKey",0.0);
}
//[...]
