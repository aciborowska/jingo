There're several places where the return value from DataInputStream#read() isn't checked.
Here is an example from BytesDeserializer :

      byte[] buffer = new byte[size];
      input.read(buffer);
      return buffer;


Buffer of size bytes is allocated.
However, the read operation may not fill size bytes.

The return value should be checked.
