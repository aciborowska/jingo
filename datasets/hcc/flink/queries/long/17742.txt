In standalone mode, i submit a job with my user jars, we know, the jars will be upload to blob server, and the TaskExecutor will be download blob file to local, So, jobmanager node and taskmanager node have two blob file at the same time. But the situation is，when the job finished or canceled, jobmanager node's blob file is removed and taskmanager is not. I think there is a risk of bursting here.
