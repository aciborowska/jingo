The Maven artifact IDs in the dependencies snippet are somewhat wrong, thus cannot be resolved. According to my finding in the repository, they should be corrected as follows.


<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
    <artifactId>flink-connector-hive_2.11</artifactId>
    <version>1.9.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

<!-- Hadoop Dependencies -->

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
    <artifactId>flink-hadoop-compatibility_2.11</artifactId>
    <version>1.9.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

<!-- Hive 1.2.1 is built with Hadoop 2.6.0. We pick 2.6.5 which flink-shaded-hadoop is pre-built with, but users can pick their own hadoop version, as long as it's compatible with Hadoop 2.6.0 -->

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
    <artifactId>flink-shaded-hadoop-2-uber</artifactId>
    <version>2.6.5-7.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
<dependency>
