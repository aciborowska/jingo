I have redone the integration of the cached match driver. It is now integrated into the optimizer instead of just switching the DriverStrategy in the NepheleJobGraphGenerator. I feel it is much cleaner this way.
So this pull request replaces (#822 | FLINK-822). 
Instead of extending the cost model like proposed in (#795 | FLINK-795) the cost estimation function get passed the number of iterations, so that you can decide for every operator on its own how to incorporate iterations.
