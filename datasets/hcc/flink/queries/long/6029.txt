Text lines inside the boxes in the Flink web dashboard have linebreaks at very odd places, and it can make the content of the boxes hard to read. (See attached screenshot.)

For clarity the content could be tabulated and indented, e.g with each ">" arrow at the start of a new text line along with the operation type ("> Filter"), and the description indented on the line below, with long descriptions wrapped to the same start indentation, so that it's easy to visually separate out operations from descriptions based on indentation:


Filter
    (filter for problems with date <= 2017-01)
-> FlatMap
    (calculate problem severity scores for
    date 2017-01)
-> Combine
    (sum all severity scores for (bin, apt) for
    date 2017-01)
