FlinkTypeFactory.toLogicalType() in flink-table-planner-blink module has duplicate case Row match in line 482-489.

I also look in FlinkTypeFactory in flink-table-planner, it also have 2 case Row match. But one of match types is 'CompositeRelDataType' which defined only in flink-table-planner module.
