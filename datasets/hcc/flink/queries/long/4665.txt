I found the following issues with boxing/unboxing and Integer

1. Current code doing boxing/unboxing to parse a primitive - It is more efficient to just call the static parseXXX method.

2. boxing/unboxing to do type cast

3. new Integer instead of valueOf - Using new Integer(int) is guaranteed to always result in a new object whereas Integer.valueOf(int) allows caching of values to be done by the compiler.
