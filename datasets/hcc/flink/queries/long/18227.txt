*1.*start-scala-shell.sh local

then I type the example from the log after I start flink shell(local)

and get stuck finally,no result in the picture I uploaded.

 

 

*2.*Maybe the above question is not regarded as issue,but "support",

um,is there any other website except stackoverflow to propose a question?

I want to try flink shell,but almost no material in China's website.

my question is more than one,but the stackoverflow has many limitations.

for example:

①I can't propose more than one question in an hour.

②If I propose several questions got downvote,my stackoverflow account will be banned.
