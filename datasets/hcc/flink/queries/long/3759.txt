The Table API can be configured to omit null-checks in generated code to speed up processing. Currently, the generated code replaces a null value with a data type specific default value if it is encountered in non-null-check mode. 

This can silently cause wrong results and should be changed such that an exception is thrown if a null value is encountered in non-null-check mode.
