new features:

	you can now distribute whole directories (this copies all files tracked by ``listStatus`` recursively)
	when distributing single files they can be tagged as executable (automatically checked for local files)



other changes:

	the name/path scheme was changed to preserve the original name. all files are now stored in a job-specific folder, instead of having a job/identifier specific name.
	the arguments passed when registering a file are abstracted away in its own data structure, making it easier to expand the DC the future. (there is no reason why one should have to change ``NepheleJobGraphGenerator`` or ``TaskManager`` for this)
	reworded/expanded some javadocs, and made it clear that local files can only be used when they are accessible form all workers



sidenotes:

	``FileCache.CopyProcess.create()`` is basically a copy function. i think we could add this as a static method to ``FileSystem`` as ``copy(URI sourcePath, URI targetPath)``.
	the code will be tested with the python interface
