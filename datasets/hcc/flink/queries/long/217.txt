A student from IMPRO-3 who is using Windows 7 reported a bug with Testbase2.

The methods "getTemp*Path()" have the prefix "file://" hardcoded.


I assigned @markus-h to this issue, since he is a Windows user.
I think there is a way in java to find the platform's way to separate directories.

use "mvn verify" to trigger the bug.
