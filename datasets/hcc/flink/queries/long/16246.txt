The AWS SDK always registers a MetricAdminMBean at the JMX MBean Server.
This allows users to turn on / off more detailed metrics via the JMX admin interface.

However, this registered bean keeps the user code classloader alive and thus causes a class leak.

Excluding the com.amazonaws.jmx.SdkMBeanRegistrySupport class from the connectors disables the default registration thus preventing the class leak. It should only disable that JMX metric admin interface and still allow users to manually configure/activate metrics for the AWS SDK.
