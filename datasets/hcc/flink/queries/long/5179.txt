The TaskManager's MetricRegistry is started when the TaskManager is created, and shutdown in the TaskManager's postStop method.

However, the registry is also shutdown within the TaskManager's disassociateFromJobManager method; however it is not restarted when the connection is re-established.

Effectively this means that a TaskManager that ever reconnected to a JobManager will not report any metrics, since the reporters are shutdown as well. Metrics will neither be sent to the WebInterface anymore.
