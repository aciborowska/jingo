In order to support dynamic scaling, the JobManager has to be able to change the parallelism of the submitted JobGraph. This basically entails that we can change the parallelism settings on the cluster side.

We already have the functionality that we can change the parallelism if it was set to ExecutionConfig.PARALLELISM_AUTO_MAX. Therefore, I think the task is mostly about making sure that things really properly work when requesting a parallelism change.
