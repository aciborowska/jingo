I run two examples in the same client. 

first one use        ExecutionEnvironment.createRemoteEnvironment("10.75.203.170", 59551)
second one use        StreamExecutionEnvironment.createRemoteEnvironment("10.75.203.170", 59551)

the first one runs successfully, but the second fails(connect to JobManager timeout), for the second one, if I change host parameter from ip to hostname, it works. 

I checked the source code and found, ExecutionEnvironment.createRemoteEnvironment 
resolves the given hostname, this will lookup the hostname for the given 
ip. In contrast, the StreamExecutionEnvironment.createRemoteEnvironment 
won't do this.

As Till Rohrmann mentioned,  the problem is that with 
FLINK-2821 [1], we can no longer resolve the hostname on the JobManager, so, we'd better resolve hostname for given ip in RemoteStreamEnvironment too.
