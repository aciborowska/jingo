Changes made in FLINK-17367 removed FLINK_VERSION from Dockerfile template, but the current generate-stackbrew-library.sh is still trying to parse `flink_version` from it, which will cause the generated `library/flink` file missing flink version in `Tags`.

While we could manually work-around the problem, a fix in script is needed.
