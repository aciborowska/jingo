Since the system clocks cannot be expected to be stable/monotonous, the subsumption logic in the checkpoint coordinator should not decide which checkpoint is "newer" based on the system time.

The checkpoint ID is guaranteed to be strictly monotonously increasing. It is a better measure to decide which checkpoint is newer.
