Hi,
two minor issues: 
1) Some documentation pages from the pre-0.4 documentation rank high on google, therefore, some users are confused about the mismatch. We should have a orange or red box on to of each pre-0.4 page that warns users and tells them that the documentation is for an old version.

2) I created a users-mailinglist. There are links to our current mailinglist on the front-page and on the contacts page.
They should now point to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stratosphere-users
(However, the stratosphere-dev list should be mentioned too)
