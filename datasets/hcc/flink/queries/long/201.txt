Currently, the DOP of the combiner is set to the DOP of the reduce task. In case, that the Reduce task has a different DOP than its input, an inserted combiner is not chainable since this requires an identical DOP with the sender task.

This bug was detected and described in more detail in this issue (#138 | FLINK-138).
Since, (#138 | FLINK-138) also includes another bug, I created a new issue.
