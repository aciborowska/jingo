There is currently
flink-core:org.apache.flink.core.memory.DataInputViewStream
and
flink-java:org.apache.flink.api.java.typeutils.runtime.DataInputViewStream

CAVEAT: They implement a different variant of reading a byte: one reads unsigned, the other reads signed. Might be that one of the variants is wrong.
