I got the following error:

    java.lang.RuntimeException: No Match found in solution set.
	at eu.stratosphere.pact.runtime.task.JoinWithSolutionSetCoGroupDriver.run(JoinWithSolutionSetCoGroupDriver.java:178)

It would be very handy for debugging to print the key that was not found in the solution.
