This kills the CLI client and the WebClient. The firstone ungracefully, for the second one, the WebServer simply goes down. In general, there should never by System.exit() calls anywhere in the code, except for the main executables: JobManager, TaskManager, YarnAppMaster, CliFrontend, WebFrontend.

This is a release blocker in my opinion.

We should think about security managers that prevent calling this method from example programs.
