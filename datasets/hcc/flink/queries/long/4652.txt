By using the credentials explicitly we are responsible for checking and refreshing credentials before they expire. If no refreshment is done we will encounter AmazonServiceException: 'The security token included in the request is expired'. To utilize automatic refreshment of credentials pass the AWSCredentialsProvider direclty to AmazonClient by removing the getCredentials() call.
