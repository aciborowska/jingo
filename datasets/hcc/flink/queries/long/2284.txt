The PartitioningStrategy in org.apache.flink.streaming.runtime.partitioner.StreamPartitioner.java is non standard and not easily understandable.

What form of partitioning is `SHUFFLE`? Shuffle just means "redistribute", it says nothing about what it does. Same with `DISTRIBUTE`. Also `GLOBAL` is not a well-defined/established term. Why is `GROUPBY` a partition type? Doesn't grouping simply hash partition (like I assume "SHUFFLE" means), so why does it have an extra entry?

Sticking with principled and established names/concepts is important to allow people to collaborate on the code. 

Why not stick with the partitioning types defined in the batch API? They are well defined and named:
```
NONE, FORWARD, RANDOM, HASH, RANGE, FORCED_REBALANCE, BROADCAST, CUSTOM
```
