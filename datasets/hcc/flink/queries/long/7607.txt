Viewing a job with a high number of tasks in the web front-end causes the page to hang, consuming 100% CPU on a core. At 200 tasks the page slows noticeably and scrolling results in long, non-responsive pauses. At 400 tasks the page only updates once per minute and is almost entirely non-responsive.

Initially, I thought this was caused by rendering a complex job graph but opening the inspector and deleting the canvas did not improve page performance. Further inspection indicated that the page was redrawing every DOM element in the task list on every update.

A possible solution is to use an approach similar to react-list and only request data/render list items that are in view and only update DOM nodes that have changed.
