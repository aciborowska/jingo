This can be confirmed by failing tests:
https://travis-ci.org/apache/flink/jobs/476533588

The failing test is StateBackendMigrationTestBase.testStateBackendRestoreSucceedsIfNewKeySerializerRequiresReconfiguration, which was a new test added in FLINK-11073.

This test started to fail when the changes were rebased on top of FLINK-9702.

The problem is that starting from FLINK-11073, all state serializers (including key serializer) should be wrapped within / retrieved from a StateSerializerProvider, which handles the logic of compatibility checks of state serializers and reassigning serializer references to reconfigured instances if required.

The new RocksDBSerializedCompositeKeyBuilder introduced in FLINK-9702, however, holds its own final reference directly to the key serializer, instead of using a StateSerializerProvider.
This change essentially makes the key serializer non-reconfigurable.
