The Flink Kinesis connector artifact bundles AWS KPL's THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES file under the META-INF folder.

The contents of this should be manually merged into the artifact's own NOTICE file, and the THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES file itself excluded.

â€”

Since Stateful Functions' statefun-flink-distribution bundles the Flink Kinesis connector, the THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES is bundled there as well. For now, since we're already about to release Stateful Functions, we'll have to apply these changes downstream in statefun-flink-distribution's NOTICE file.

Once this is fixed upstream in the Flink Kinesis connector's NOTICE file, we can revert the changes in StateFun.
