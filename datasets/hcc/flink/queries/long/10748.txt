In a HA Jobmanager setup, connecting to a follower results in a redirect (HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect) to the leader. However, it redirects to an ip address (why is it not the hostname?) which is in another network and not reachable. I have configured hostnames, not ip addresses.

Wouldn't it be better to proxy the request to another jobmanager instead of using a redirect?
