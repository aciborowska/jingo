The update_branch_version.sh only works properly when bumping the snapshot version.

It cannot be used without issues to update a snapshot to a proper release version, i.e. 1.5-SNAPSHOT to 1.5.0. The version strings below in docs/_config.yml are not correctly set and have to manually modified as they all should refer to "1.5".



version_title: "1.5.0"
version_javadocs: "1.5.0"
version_scaladocs: "1.5.0"
