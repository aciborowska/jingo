In the Contribute Code page on the website, it references Hadoop 1.x support under "How to use Git as a committer" and "Snapshots (Nightly Builds)"

> If you want to build for Hadoop 1, activate the build profile via mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dhadoop.profile=1.
> ...
> You can now include Apache Flink as a Maven dependency (see above) with version 1.6-SNAPSHOT (or `` for compatibility with old Hadoop 1.x versions).

That snapshot reference includes the Markdown code:

(or `{{ site.FLINK_VERSION_HADOOP_1_LATEST}}` for compatibility with old Hadoop 1.x versions)

but there's no definition in config.yml for FLINK_VERSION_HADOOP_1_LATEST. And looking through the other docs, it seems like only Hadoop 2.x is supported at this point.

Is Hadoop 1.x still supported? And if not, should these references be removed?
