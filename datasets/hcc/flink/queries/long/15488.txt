When using logback it is not possible to start the taskmanager using taskamanger.sh scripts. The same problem (probably) occurs when using slf4j that logs into the console.

The problem is that when calculating memory configuration with BashJavaUtils class the result is returned through standard output. If something is logged into the console it may result in undefined behavior such as e.g. 


Error: Could not find or load main class 13:51:23.961
