Recently, I received timeouts from some tests in ExecutionGraphRestartTest like this


Tests in error: 
  ExecutionGraphRestartTest.testConcurrentLocalFailAndRestart:638 Â» Timeout



This particular instance is from 1.3.2 RC2 and stuck in ExecutionGraphTestUtils#waitUntilDeployedAndSwitchToRunning() but I also had instances stuck in ExecutionGraphTestUtils#waitUntilJobStatus.
