I think you guys are using our script for synchronizing JIRA. However, you didn't adjust the target JIRA identifier so it is still posting to Spark. In the past few hours we've seen a lot of random Flink pull requests being linked on the Spark JIRA. This is obviously not desirable for us since they are different projects.

The JIRA links are being created by the user "Maximilian Michels" (Maximilian Michels).

I saw these as recently as 5 hours ago. There are around 23 links that were created - if you could go ahead and remove them that would be useful. Thanks!
