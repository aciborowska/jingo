The SSL setup examples [1] were updated to rely on PKCS12 format (instead of the old JKS keystore) but PKCS12 does not support separate passwords for the key store and the key itself.



> Warning:  Different store and key passwords not supported for PKCS12 KeyStores. Ignoring user-specified -keypass value.




Also, some of the examples still rely on the old JKS keystore and are not using PKCS12 yet.
