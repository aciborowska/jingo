The TypeExtractor does not correctly handle POJO fields with bounded generics.

For example:


public class Foo<SomeKey extends BarKey> implements Serializable {

    public SomeKey someKey;

    public Foo() {}

    public Foo(SomeKey someKey) {
        this.someKey = someKey;
    }
}



Is identified as:


PojoType<org.apache.flink.streaming.examples.wordcount.WordCount$Foo, fields = [someKey: GenericType<java.lang.Object>]>



So even though the reflection field has a type, the type information only describes a Object class.
