KeySelectors must return deterministic keys, i.e., if invoked multiple times on the same object, the returned key must be the same.

The documentation about this aspect is broken ("The key can be of any type and be derived from arbitrary computations.").

We need to fix the JavaDocs of the KeySelector interface and the web documentation (https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/apis/common/index.html#specifying-keys).
