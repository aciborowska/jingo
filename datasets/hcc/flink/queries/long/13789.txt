In TransactionalIdsGenerator.java], prefix contains taskName of the particular task which could ultimately contain user code.Â  In some cases, user code contains conversion specifiers like %, the string formatting could fail.

For example, in Flink SQL code, user could have a LIKE statement with a % wildcard, the % wildcard will end up in the prefix and get mistreated during formatting, causing task to fail.

Think we should move prefix out of the string formatting.
