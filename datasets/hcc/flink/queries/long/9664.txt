The ML documentation example isn't complete: https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.5/dev/libs/ml/quickstart.html#loading-data

The referred section loads data from an astroparticle binary classification dataset to showcase SVM. The dataset uses 0 and 1 as labels, which doesn't produce correct results. The SVM predictor expects -1 and 1 labels to correctly predict the label. The documentation, however, doesn't mention that. The example therefore doesn't work without a clue why.

The documentation should be updated with an explicit mention to -1 and 1 labels and a mapping function that shows the conversion of the labels.
