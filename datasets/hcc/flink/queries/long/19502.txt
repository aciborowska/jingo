It would be nice if arbitrary values in flink-conf.yaml could be overwritten from the environment, especially since this can be used to override config comfortably from kubernetes' kustomizations.

(The attached patch to https://github.com/apache/flink-docker achieves that. Should I go ahead and create a PR?)
