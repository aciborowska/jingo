On Flink version 1.6.x we observe a significant increase of the latency in UI. 

After performance profiling, we have concluded that during UI rendering back-end spends 50% of the time on GC pauses, which means that Flink 1.6.x is not friendly with G1 GC ergonomics configurations. 

On Flink side, MetricStore creates a huge amount of short living objects for our job, which provokes a lot of Young GC pauses for a non-small job, with around 50 operators and 120 parallelisms. 

Samples of GC logs are in attach.
