While a job is running the web-interface polls IO metrics using the MetricFetcher/MetricQueryService. For finished jobs these metrics are stored in the ExecutionGraph; each vertex has an IOMetrics object; basically a snapshot taken when the task was finished. 

For completed jobs this mechanism is working. However, for failed jobs it doesn't; in this case last fetched metrics are displayed.

This isn't intended behavior and should be fixed.
