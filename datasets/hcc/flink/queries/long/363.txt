This fix enables local filesystem writes in a cluster setup.
Output directories for local FS writes are created on each TM but not on the JM (except if it hosts a TM as well).

The currently implemented override policy for local filesystem writes is:

	existing files is not deleted to create output directories (to avoid deleting OS files)
	existing files in existing output directories are overwritten



Let me know, if you want to enable deleting local FS files to create output directories.
