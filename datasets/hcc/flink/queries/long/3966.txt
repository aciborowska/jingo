When generating avro code, users will often supply createSetters=false and fieldVisibility=private for Avro specific records (for effectively immutable records).  This means that, according to TypeExtractor.isValidPojoField, the object is not a valid pojo (though is completely a valid avro object) and the TypeInformation factory will fail.

Specific records are usually created using builders, so perhaps using this mechanism for when creating a new record / mutating an existing record is required.
