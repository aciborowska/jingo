There is no way to query the latest state of logs of jobmanager/taskmanager.

The Web UI show only the first version that was ever displayed.

How to reproduce:

	(not sure if necessary) configure logback as described here: https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/best_practices.html#use-logback-when-running-flink-on-a-cluster
	start a cluster
	show jobmanager logs in the Web UI
	run example job
	check again the jobmanager logs, there is no trace of the job. Clicking the refresh button does not help
