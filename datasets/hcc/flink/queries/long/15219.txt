Currently, plugins cannot be used in `LocalEnvironment` as `FileSystem`s are only initialized without `PluginManager`. In all other environments, the plugin manager is initialized in `TaskManagerRunner`.

That means unless a user manually adds


   final Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
   FileSystem.initialize(configuration, PluginUtils.createPluginManagerFromRootFolder(configuration));


to his entry point, he cannot use plugins, which means no s3 filesystems after FLINK-11956.

We should add the proper initialization to the LocalExecutionEnvironment (at LocalExecutor?), so that the user does not have to it manually.
