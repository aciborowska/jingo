Each PythonStreamer instance passes the original program arguments to the python process upon creation. However, not check is made whether there were any arguments at all, which results in an empty String being passed as an argument.



process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[] {pythonBinaryPath, "-O", "-B", planPath, arguments});
