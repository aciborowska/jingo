Every metric group contains a scope string, representing what entities (job/task/etc.) a given metric belongs to, which is calculated on demand. 

Before this string is cached a CharacterFilter is applied to it, which is provided by the callee, usually a reporter. This was done since different reporters have different requirements in regards to valid characters. The filtered string is cached so that we don't have to refilter the string every time.

This all works fine with a single reporter; with multiple however it is completely broken as only the first filter is ever applied.
