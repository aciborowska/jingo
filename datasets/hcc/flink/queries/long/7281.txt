I discovered couple of issues while getting ready for release 1.3.2:


	some old, misleading release scripts and release README
	the maven-release-plugin is not correctly configured for doing actual releases with it
	the quickstarts are not configured to depend on the project version and thus require manual updating, also of slf4j and log4j versions
	the maven-javadoc-plugin configuration does not work when using the the maven-release-plugin, that is we have to move the config to the plugin section and out of the release profile
