Hello,

I recently merged this https://github.com/dimalabs/ozone/pull/64 pull request  by @Aheise into the main code line.
It automatically uploads successful builds to the Sonatype OSS Snapshot repository (https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/eu/stratosphere/ozone/).
I therefore changed the version of Stratosphere to `0.4-ozone-SNAPSHOT`.

You can now add us as a dependency by adding the snapshot repository to your pom:
```xml
 <repositories>
       <repository>
         <id>snapshots-repo</id>
         <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
         <releases><enabled>false</enabled></releases>
         <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
       </repository>
</repositories>
```
And us as a dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>eu.stratosphere</groupId>
	<artifactId>ozone</artifactId>
	<version>0.4-ozone-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
(there is one little issue: it is not really working this way  But I'm on it (Help is appreciated . You have to add pact-clients and pact-common as a dependency. )

We always push two versions to Sonatype: `0.4-ozone-SNAPSHOT` (which is hadoop v1) and  `0.4-ozone-hadoop2-SNAPSHOT` (hadoop v2, with yarn support).

I'm also going to release a `0.2-ozone` version to maven central! You then won't have to add the snapshot repository manually.

I have the following questions for you. I'd like to know what you think, how other projects are doing this and so on.

1) I'm not happy with the version names. They are too long. The "-SNAPSHOT" is currently hardcoded into our poms. I could change the versions back to 0.2-ozone and let a script change the version before deploying them to Sonatype. 

2) @aalexandrov changed the artifact ID in the main pom to `ozone`. This is how our main pom currently looks like:
```xml
<groupId>eu.stratosphere</groupId>
<artifactId>ozone</artifactId>
<version>0.4-ozone-SNAPSHOT</version>
```
This means that our project is called `ozone`, which is not the case. I suggest to change the name back to `stratosphere`.
As @ktzoumas suggested, we can use other atmosphere gases such as Nitrogen, Oxygen, Neon, Helium, Krypton, Xenon, Iodine. We could append these to the version numbers. Like `0.6-neon`, `0.10-helium` etc.
