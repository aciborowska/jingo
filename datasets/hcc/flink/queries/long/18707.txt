If you use the FsStateBackend (or MemoryStateBackend), and you have ListState, then you can get an iterator and remove() an entry, and it all works as expected.


If you use the RocksDBStateBackend, the remove() call doesn’t throw an exception, but the ListState isn’t updated.

As Aljoscha Krettek noted:
We cannot efficiently implement it [remove] for RocksDB
So an exception should be thrown when calling remove() call.
