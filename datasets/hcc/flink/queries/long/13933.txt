When i use Hive Generic UDTF in table API,  something wrong with CalciteContextException: No match found for function signature . As mentioned in tutorials, Hive’s GenericUDTF is automatically translated into Flink’s TableFunction. However, it didn't give a property of TABLE_FUNCTION. In convertToSqlFunction, when functionDefinition is instanceof TableFunctionDefinition, it will further call category.isTableFunction() and lead a wrong answer.
