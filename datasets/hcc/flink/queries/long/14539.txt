Currently unique key metadata of a project relnode are only kept in the following three situations:


	project the child unique keys while not changing them
	cast the child unique key when ignoring nulls and the original type of the field and cast type are the same
	rename the child unique keys



Besides these situations, concat and concat_ws should also keep the metadata if they won't break the uniqueness of the child unique keys, i.e. each operands is in one of the above situations, and the operands include all the child unique keys. 

Say the f0 and f1 are the unique key fields of the child node, the following sqls should keep the unique key metadata 



select concat(f0, f1)
-- the type of f0 and f1 are both varchar originally and ignore nulls
select concat(cast(f0 as varchar), f1)
select cast(concat(f0, f1) as varchar)



while the following sqls should discard the unique key metadata


-- the type of f0 and f1 are both varchar originally
select concat(cast(f0 as bigint), f1)
select cast(concat(f0, f1) as bigint)
