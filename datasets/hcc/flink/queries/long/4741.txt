WebRuntimeMonitor does not shutdown correctly, causing the overall application to hang on shutdown. It shuts down bootstrap.group (EventLoopGroup) but not the bootstrap.childGroup (EventLoopGroup).
If WebRuntimeMonitor is not used (local.start-webserver=false), this problem does not occur.

Class: WebRuntimeMonitor
method: stop()
Line: ~387

Called:
    bootstrap.group().shutdownGracefully()
Not called:
    bootstrap.childGroup().shutdownGracefully()
