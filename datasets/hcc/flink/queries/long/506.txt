Add a Hadoop-like Distributed Cache utility.

The distributed cache is needed for tasks that require files to be accessible with local file paths. Files are registered at the Program level with (file, name). The utility must take the files and write them to the local temp directory, assigning them a random file name and make the path available under the name.
