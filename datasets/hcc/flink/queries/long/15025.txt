FLINK-14581 accidentally excluded the directory src/main/resources from the jar of the flink-python. This results into that the license files of the bundled third-party dependencies which are not of apache license are not bundled into the jar. The content of the NOTICE file defined in src/main/resources is also not included in the jar.
