Class loading of user-defined data types must always happen with the user-code class loader. The instantiation of the user-defined aggregate types happens in the read() method of the iteration event that transmits them.

Since the event has no access to that particular class loader, it can only receive the serialized data. The actual instantiation of these types must happen lazily when they are accessed by the iteration head or sync tasks, which have the required class loader.
