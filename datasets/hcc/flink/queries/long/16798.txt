With FLINK-15519, in the TM start-up scripts, we have captured logs from BashJavaUtils and passed into the TM JVM process via environment variable. These logs will be merged with other TM logs, writing to same places respecting user's log configurations.

This effort was broken in FLINK-15727, where the outputs from BashJavaUtils  are thrown away, except for the result JVM parameters and dynamic configurations
