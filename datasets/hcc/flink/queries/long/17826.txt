In FLINK-17361, we added custom query on JDBC tables, but missing to add the same ability on new jdbc connector (i.e. JdbcDynamicTableSourceSinkFactory). 

In the new jdbc connector, maybe we should call it scan.query to keep consistent with other scan options, besides we need to make "table-name" optional, but add validation that "table-name" and "scan.query" shouldn't both be empty, and "table-name" must not be empty when used as sink.
