340/550 lines in the SQL Client pom.xml are just around Hive and Hadoop dependencies.  Hive has nothing to do with the SQL Client and it will be hard to maintain the long list of  exclusion there. Some dependencies are even in a provided scope and not test scope.

We should remove all dependencies on Hive/Hadoop and replace catalog-related tests by a testing catalog. Similar to how we tests source/sinks.
