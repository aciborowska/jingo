The changes introduced for FLINK-5998 change what goes into the flink-dost fat jar. As it is, this means that trying to start a cluster results in a ClassNotFoundException of LogFactory in commons-logging.

One solution is to now make the shaded Hadoop jar a proper fat-jar, so that we again have all the dependencies.
