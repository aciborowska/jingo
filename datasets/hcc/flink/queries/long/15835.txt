The flink-oss-fs-hadoop filesystem has a dependency on flink-fs-hadoop-shaded (a trimmed down version of hadoop-common) and hadoop-aliyun, the latter also having a dependency on hadoop-common.

Since flink-fs-hadoop-shaded bundles everything and creates a dependency-reduced pom (that as a result contains no dependencies) the transitive hadoop-common dependency pulled in from hadoop-aliyun is not being altered in any way, and is hence included in it's entirety in the jar.

We should add an explicit exclusion for the transitive hadoop-common dependency.
