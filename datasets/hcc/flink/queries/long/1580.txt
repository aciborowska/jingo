Currently, the TaskManager initializes many heavy load objects upon registration at the JobManager. If an exception occurs during the initialization it takes quite long until the JobManager detects the TaskManager failure.

Therefore, it would be better if we could rearrange the initialization logic so that the TaskManager only registers at the JobManager if the all objects could be initialized successfully. Moreover, it would be worthwhile to move some of the initialization work out of the TaskManager.
