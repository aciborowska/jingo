Currently when we use code below


new ElasticSearchSink.Builder(...).build()


we will get Invalid lambda deserialization error if users doesn't setRestClientFactory explicitly.  The reasion behind this bug has been figured out in FLINK-18006, which is caused by maven. However,  we only fix the behaviour in ElasticSearchDynamicSink. When users who build es sink by themselvies will still get the error.
