The user-facing ListState is supposed to return an empty list when no element is contained in the state.

A previous change altered that behavior to make it in the runtime classes accessible whether a ListState is empty.

To not break the user-facing API, we need to restore the behavior for ListState exposed to the users via the RuntimeContext.
