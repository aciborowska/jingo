The jar of flink-ml-lib should not contain the license and notice file as it actually does not bundle the related dependencies. We should remove these file on branch release-1.10.

BTW. The release-1.9 branch does not have this problem since the license and notice are added in 1.10. And on master(1.11), we will bundle the dependencies, so the license and notice file should be kept, see FLINK-15847.
