The following exception is being thrown indefinitely once a worker is lost:


org.apache.flink.util.FlinkException: Multi task slot is not local and, thus, does not fulfill the co-location constraint.



This is caused by FLINK-16139, which is fixed in Flink 1.10.1.

To unblock the release for Stateful Functions 2.0.0, which depends on Flink 1.10.0,
for StateFun 2.0.0 we can use the old legacy scheduler for the time being.
