In FLINK-14845 an lz4-java dependency was moved from flink-table to flink-runtime. With this commit lz4 was included in the flink-runtime jar, and the NOTICE file for flink-runtime was adjusted appropriately.
The follow-up that removed the shading (FLINK-15311) did not update the NOTICE files however; it is still listed in flink-runtime when it should be in flink-dist.
