In the Data Sink documentation, there is no example on how to use said functions â€“ even if they are only intent for debugging (which is exactly what I want to do right now).

While print is quite simple, what I need is to get the resulting processing, so I'd probably need some of the write functions (since FLINK-8285 mentions that iterators are out).

I'd either suggest adding the examples or link the listed functions to their documentation.
