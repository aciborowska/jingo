The WritableSerializer, ValueSerializer, AvroSerializer, WritableComparator and ValueComparator use plain Kryo instances to copy the objects. In cases where Kryo fails to copy the object, e.g. missing no-arg constructor, the serializer and comparator instances fail even though the objects are serializable.

As a fallback strategy I propose to copy the objects by serializing and deserializing them.
