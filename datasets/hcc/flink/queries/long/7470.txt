Mesos doesn't support fencing tokens in the scheduler protocol; it assumes external leader election among scheduler instances.   The last connection wins; prior connections for a given framework ID are closed.

The Mesos RM should not register as a framework until it has acquired RM leadership.   Evolve the ResourceManager as necessary.   One option is to introduce an ResourceManagerRunner that acquires leadership before starting the RM.
