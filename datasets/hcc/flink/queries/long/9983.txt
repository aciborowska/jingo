If they are not used when recovering you can get intro problems with duplicate output data when a failure occurs after a savepoint was taken but before the next checkpoint occurs.

The fix, in the long run, is to differentiate between savepoints that have side effects and those that don't. The former would be used for a "stop-with-savepoint" scenario while the latter is for in-between savepoints. This is harder to implement, so I vote for the easy fix described for now for fixing the duplication problems.
