The promotion of transitive dependencies in flink-runtime causes flink-dist to contain some transitive dependencies from flink-shaded-hadoop. (most notably, avro and codehaus.jackson)

We will either have to add an exclusion for each dependency to flink-dist, set flink-shaded-hadoop to provided in flink-runtime (hacky, but less intrusive), or remove the promotion and explicitly depend on various akka dependencies.
