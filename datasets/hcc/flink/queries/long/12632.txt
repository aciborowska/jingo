When a job is submitted through the web UI and the deployment fails, the UI doesn't show the full error response. It just prints out a "Internal Server Error" message with no additional information.

The logs however show the full error response.

FLINK-11902 modified the REST API to no longer hide the exception, but the WebUI isn't handling the error response properly (it only reads and displays part of it).
