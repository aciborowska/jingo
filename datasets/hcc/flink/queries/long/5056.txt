Currently if BucketingSink receives no data after a checkpoint and then a notification about a previous checkpoint arrives, it clears its state. This can 
lead to not committing valid data about intermediate checkpoints for whom
a notification has not arrived yet. As a simple sequence that illustrates the 
problem:
-> input data 
-> snapshot(0) 
-> input data
-> snapshot(1)
-> no data
-> notifyCheckpointComplete(0)

the last will clear the state of the Sink without committing as final the data 
that arrived for checkpoint 1.
