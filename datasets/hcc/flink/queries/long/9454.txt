Build instruction provided on the page does not work for MapR 6.

When executing:

mvn clean install -DskipTests -Pvendor-repos,mapr -Dhadoop.version=2.7.0-mapr-1710 -Dzookeeper.version=3.4.5-mapr-1710

 

The result is:

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.rat:apache-rat-plugin:0.12:check (default) on project flink-parent: Too many files with unapproved license: 7 See RAT report in: ...

 

I fixed the problem by adding "-Drat.skip=true" but there might be a better fix.
