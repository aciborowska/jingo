Use a process supervisor to automatically restart Mesos processes. This is needed because Mesos uses a "fail-fast" approach to error handling, e.g., the Mesos master will exit when it discovers it has been partitioned away from the Zookeeper quorum. Currently the some of the tests cannot pass because the Mesos processes exiting.

Acceptance Criteria

	Running tests with --deployment-mode mesos-session should not fail due to reasons related to the Mesos setup.
