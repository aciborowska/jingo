The test `testSimple` in `MapBundleOperatorTest` may fail due if `HashMap` iterates in a different order. Specifically, `assertThat(Arrays.asList("k1=v1,v2", "k2=v3"), is(func.getOutputs()))` may fail. `testSimple` depends on `open` in class `AbstractMapBundleOperator`. The field `bundle` is a `HashMap`. However, `HashMap` does not guarantee any specific order of entries. Thus, the test can fail due to a different iteration order.
