HTTP handlers are initialized upon instance creation of WebRuntimeMonitor. However, this is useless because the initialization is not completed until the start(jobManager) method is called. In the meantime, user gets messages about ongoing leader elections from the webfrontend.

I would suggest to move the starting code in the constructor to the start(jobManager) method.
