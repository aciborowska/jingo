While testing a PR for FLINK-17663, HiveModuleTest.testConstantReturnValue didn't finish

I've looped the code 2000 times on my local machine and it didn't happen again. Thread dump doesn't suggest any actual dead lock, more like something has crashed and didn't notify CLI (as there were very few active threads from Flink). It doesn't look like it was caused by FLINK-17663, but there is that possibility.
