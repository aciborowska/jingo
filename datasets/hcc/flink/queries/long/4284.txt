Relevant section for DataSet (apis/batch/index.md; L 57-60):


The following program is a complete, working example of WordCount. You can copy &amp; paste the code
to run it locally. You only have to include the correct Flink's library into your project
(see Section [Linking with Flink](#linking-with-flink)) and specify the imports. Then you are ready
to go!



Relevant section for CEP(apis/streaming/libs/cep.md; L 45-48:


## Getting Started

If you want to jump right in, you have to [set up a Flink program]({{ site.baseurl }}/apis/batch/index.html#linking-with-flink).
Next, you have to add the FlinkCEP dependency to the `pom.xml` of your project.



The CEP doc probably shouldn't refer to the DataSet documentation at all.
