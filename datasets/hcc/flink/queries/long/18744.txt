If I resume a job from a savepoint which is modified by state processor API, such as loading from /savepoint-path-old and writing to /savepoint-path-new, the job resumed with savepointpath = /savepoint-path-new  while throwing an Exception : 
 /savepoint-path-new/{some-ui-id} (No such file or directory).
 I think it's an issue because of flink 1.11 use absolute path in savepoint and checkpoint, but state processor API missed this.

The job will work well with new savepoint(which path is /savepoint-path-new) if I copy all dictionary except `_metadata from` /savepoint-path-old to /savepoint-path-new.
