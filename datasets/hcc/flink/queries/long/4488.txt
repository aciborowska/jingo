In per-job mode, the Yarn cluster currently shuts down after the first interactively executed job. Users may want to execute multiple jobs in one Jar. I would suggest to use this mechanism only for jobs which run detached. For interactive jobs, shutdown of the cluster is additionally handled by the CLI which should be sufficient to ensure cluster shutdown. Cluster shutdown could only become a problem in case of a network partition to the cluster or outage of the CLI.
