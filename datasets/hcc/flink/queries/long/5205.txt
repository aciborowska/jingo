The JobManager executes the removeJob call at various places asynchronously via the RemoveJob message, even though this is not strictly needed. This is not necessary and can be done synchronously. The advantage would be that the remove job operation won't interfere with recovered or resubmitted jobs which have the same JobID as the job for which the message was initially triggered.
