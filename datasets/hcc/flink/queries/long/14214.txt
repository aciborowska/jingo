https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-13051 introduced a performance regression visible for example here as a drop on August 30th (note that the later performance improvement is caused by serialisation improvement, which is unrelated to the previous slow down). 

Probable suspect is the following .isDone() check executed inside StreamTwoInputProcessor once per record:




// to avoid starvation, if the input selection is ALL and availableInputsMask is not ALL,
// always try to check and set the availability of another input
// TODO: because this can be a costly operation (checking volatile inside CompletableFuture`
//  this might be optimized to only check once per processed NetworkBuffer
if (inputSelectionHandler.shouldSetAvailableForAnotherInput()) {
	checkAndSetAvailable(1 - readingInputIndex);
}
