The TypeExtractor checks for each operation whether the DataSet element types are valid arguments for the UDF. However, it checks for strict equality instead of a subtype relationship. Thus the following computation would not work even though it should semantically be correct.

DataSet[B].map(new MapFunction[A,A]()
{ A map(A x)}
) with B being a sub class of A.
