After investigating to find the cause for a submitted job alternating between the deploying and running states, I tried setting the logging to info level and realized that some deployment exceptions were being logged as info when they really should be a warning or error level.

In particular, the following line (at line 960) of the 1.9.1 branch of the Task class logs as info:

LOG.info("{} ({}) switched from {} to {}.", taskNameWithSubtask, executionId, currentState, newState, cause);

This log line always has a non null exception cause so it would make sense to log at warning or error level for this state transition so it is more easily found.
