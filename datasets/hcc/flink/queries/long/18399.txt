In current implementation of PrintUtils, all result will be collected to local memory to compute column width first. this can works fine with batch query and bounded stream query. but for unbounded stream query, the result will be endless, so the result will be never printed. To solve this, we can use fix-length strategy, and print a row immediately once the row is accessed.
