Iteration over state.bucketStates is protected by synchronization in other methods, except for the following in restoreState():


    for (BucketState<T> bucketState : state.bucketStates.values()) {


and following in close():


    for (Map.Entry<String, BucketState<T>> entry : state.bucketStates.entrySet()) {
      closeCurrentPartFile(entry.getValue());


w.r.t. bucketState.pendingFilesPerCheckpoint , there is similar issue starting line 752:


      Set<Long> pastCheckpointIds = bucketState.pendingFilesPerCheckpoint.keySet();
      LOG.debug("Moving pending files to final location on restore.");
      for (Long pastCheckpointId : pastCheckpointIds) {
