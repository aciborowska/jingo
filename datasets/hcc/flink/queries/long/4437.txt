In CheckpointCoordinator#triggerCheckpoint():

        // make sure the minimum interval between checkpoints has passed
        if (lastTriggeredCheckpoint + minPauseBetweenCheckpoints > timestamp) {


If two threads evaluate 'lastTriggeredCheckpoint + minPauseBetweenCheckpoints > timestamp' in close proximity before lastTriggeredCheckpoint is updated, the two threads may have an inconsistent view of "lastTriggeredCheckpoint" and updates to fields correlated with "lastTriggeredCheckpoint" may be lost.
