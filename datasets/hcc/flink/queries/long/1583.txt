Currently, the InstanceManager identifies Instance}}s based on their {{InstanceConnectionInfo. In case of a restarted TaskManager which tries to register newly at the JobManager, the InstanceManager can mistake this TaskManager as already registered. This can lead to a corrupted state.

We should identify TaskManager}}s based on some ID to distinguish distinct registration attempts of a restarted {{TaskManager. This will improve the system's stability.
