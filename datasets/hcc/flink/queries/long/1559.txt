Akka has the nasty property that it does not use IP addresses and hostnames interchangeably. 

Example: If the JobManager is started at akka:tcp//flink@localhost:1234/user/JOBMANAGER and a job client actor tries to send messages to akka:tcp//flink@127.0.0.1:1234/user/JOBMANAGER, the job manager actor system will receive the messages, but throw them away, because they are not destined for the actor system.

I am not sure whether this is a bug or a feature in akka, but we need to deal with it. To be on the safe side, I suggest to build all akka URLs with ip addresses. We can still use host names in our logic (connection infos, local assignments, etc)
