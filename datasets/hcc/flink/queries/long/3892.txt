If an invalid hostname is specificed or the hostname can't be resolved from the current interface, ConnectionUtils.findAddressUsingStrategy may throw a NullPointerException. When trying to access the InetAddress of an InetSocketAddress, null is returned when the host could not been resolved.

The solution is to abort the attempt to find the local address if the host couldn't be resolved.
