val words: DataStream[WC] = // [...]
val wordCounts = words.keyBy("word").window(/*window specification*/)

// or, as a case class, which is less typing
case class WC(word: String, count: Int)
val words: DataStream[WC] = // [...]

val wordCounts = words.keyBy("word").reduce(/*window specification*/)


Should be: 
val wordCounts = words.keyBy("word").reduce window(/window specification/)
