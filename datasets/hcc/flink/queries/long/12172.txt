Hello,

The problem is if you have a BucketingSink, the following case may occur :

Let's say you have a 2019-04-12–12 bucket created with several files inside which are pending/finished
 You create a savepoint and shut down the job
 After an hour for instance you start the job from the savepoint and a new bucket is created, 2019-04-16 for instance. 
 The problem is that the .pending ones from the old buckets seem to never be moved to finished state if there is a new hourly bucket created.
