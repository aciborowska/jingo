When users go to the documentation, either via the homepage's quickstart menu or the documentation menu, the transition to the documentation is not easily noticeable; the layout of both pages are pretty much the same. There should be a hint in the documentation page "Flink documentation version X. Click here to go back to the homepage" or something similar.
