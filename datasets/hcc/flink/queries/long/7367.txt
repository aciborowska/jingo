Right now, FlinkKinesisProducer only expose two configs for the underlying KinesisProducer:


	AGGREGATION_MAX_COUNT
	COLLECTION_MAX_COUNT



Well, according to AWS doc and their sample on github, developers can set more to make the max use of KinesisProducer, and make it fault-tolerant (e.g. by increasing timeout).

I select a few more configs that we need when using Flink with Kinesis:


	MAX_CONNECTIONS
	RATE_LIMIT
	RECORD_MAX_BUFFERED_TIME
	RECORD_TIME_TO_LIVE
	REQUEST_TIMEOUT



Flink is using KPL's default values. They make Flink writing too fast to Kinesis, which fail Flink job too frequently. We need to parameterize FlinkKinesisProducer to pass in the above params, in order to slowing down Flink's write rate to Kinesis.
