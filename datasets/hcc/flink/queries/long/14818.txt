In network benchmark (for example 1000 channels benchmark with 4 record writers) StreamNetworkBenchmarkEnvironment#createInputGate creates 1000 input gates with 4 input channels each, which doesn't make much sense. I would expect either having 4 receivers with single input gate with 1000 channels each, or a single receiver with 4 input gates, with 1000 channels each.
