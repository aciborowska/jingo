deploying two jobs with the same consumer group id, still treated as different consumer groups. This behavior does not comply with kafka expectations. Same consumer group ids should be treated as the same group this will enable deploying more jobs (specially if they are stateless ) on demand and it also how normal consumer groups behave.Â 

reproduce :

deploy the same job twice - both jobs consumes the same message although they share the same consumer id
