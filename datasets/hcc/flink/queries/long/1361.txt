The log file name for the JobManager changed from "flink-<user>jobmanager-instance<hostname><id>.log" to "flink<user>jobManager-instance<hostname>-<id>.log".

I believe this changed was undesired. The changes could potentially break scripts that expect a certain name format. Also, this is inconsistent with the naming of the TaskManager log which is all lower case.

This is a regression of b313eeb76cb5a9ec60923f3c4ab5b47569bc21e6

I propose to revert this change to the old all lower case naming.
