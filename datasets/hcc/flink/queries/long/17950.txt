The Scala StreamExecutionEnvironment.countinuousSource(...) method has two critical problems:

	Its return type is Unit instead of DataStream, so that no one can use the created stream
	It does not forward the TypeInformation identified by the ScalaCompiler but relies on the Java TypeExtraction stack, which cannot handle most Scala types.
