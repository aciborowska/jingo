The biggest problem for distributions I see is the variety of problems caused by users' lack of format dependency.
 These three formats are very small and no third party dependence, and they are widely used by table users.
 Actually, we don't have any other built-in table formats now..

	flink-csv-1.10.0.jar
	flink-json-1.10.0.jar



 We can just bundle them in "flink/lib/".
 It not solve all problems and it is independent of "fat" and "slim". But also improve usability.
