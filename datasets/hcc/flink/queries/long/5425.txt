In metrics at the jobmanager level and below, the "<host>" scope variable is being replaced by the IP rather than the hostname. The taskmanager metrics, meanwhile, use the host name.

You can see the job manager behavior at https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/a1934255421b97eefd579183e9c7199c43ad1a2c/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/jobmaster/JobManagerRunner.java#L147 compared to TaskManagerLocation#getHostname().

The problem with this is mainly that due to the presence of "." (period) characters in the IP address and thereby the metric name, the metric names show up strangely in Graphite/Grafana, where "." is the metric group separator.

If it's not possible to make jobmanager metrics use the hostname, I suggest replacing "." with "-" in the <host> section.
