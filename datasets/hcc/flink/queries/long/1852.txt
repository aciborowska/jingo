The Scala API's count and collect methods are declared without parentheses indicating that these methods don't have any side effects. Since they trigger the execution of the ExecutionGraph and in the future will buffer the intermediate results somewhere, they definitely have side effects. Therefore, I'd propose to add parentheses to these methods.
