Currently, the meta data for each checkpoint consists of up to 5 long values which are passed through several functions. When adding/removing meta data  we would have to change function signatures in many places. Furthermore, this is prone to errors when the order of arguments is changed accidentally. We should introduce a CheckpointMetaData which encapsulates this checkpoint meta data.
