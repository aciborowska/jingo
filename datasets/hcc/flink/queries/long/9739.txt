A user reporter on the mailing list has reported that the RocksDBStateBackend no longer supports GlusterFS mounted volumes.
Configuring file:///home/abc/share lead to an exception that claimed the path to not be absolute.

This was working fine in 1.4.2.

In FLINK-6557 the RocksDBStateBackend was refactored to use java Files instead of Flink Paths, potentially causing the issue.
