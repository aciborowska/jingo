In https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/12bf7c1a0b81d199085fe874c64763c51a93b3bf the expected behaviour of Folding/Reducing/List states have been changed to return null instead of empty collections/default values.

This was adapted for the included state backends (Memory, FS, Rocks) but not for the Generic state wrappers. As there are no tests for the Generic backend using the StateBackendTestBase this didnt show.
