This issue has been reported by a user: http://apache-flink-user-mailing-list-archive.2336050.n4.nabble.com/Flink-dependencies-shading-td11304.html

The httpclient library tends to clash with various other dependencies (elasticsearch, awssdk, ...).
I think we can just shade it in the flink-mesos module.
