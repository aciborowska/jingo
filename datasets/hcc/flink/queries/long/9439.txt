Rarely DispatcherTest#testJobRecovery dead locks on master. Example deadlock in my pull request:

https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/383147736/log.txt

afterwards I have stripped down `flink-runtime`, looped on travis this test and it also dead locks on clean master branch:

https://github.com/pnowojski/flink/commits/loop-runtime-master

(note, that looped versions sometimes also fails with an exception from setUp: {{Â akka.actor.InvalidActorNameException: actor name [dispatcher_testJobRecovery] is not unique! }} but this might be unrelated).

Example failed build:
