In FLINK-2314 the file sources for the DataStream API were reworked.

The documentation doesn't explain the (new?) semantics of the file sources.
In which order are files read?
How are file modifications treated? (appends, in place modifications?)

I suspect this table is also not up-to-date: https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/apis/streaming/fault_tolerance.html#fault-tolerance-guarantees-of-data-sources-and-sinks
