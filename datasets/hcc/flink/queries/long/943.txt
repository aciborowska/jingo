In FLINK-942 I noticed that env.java.opts are not read by the startup scripts. While doing the fix I discovered a related problem:

This works fine:

env.java.opts: -Dio.netty.leakDetectionLevel=paranoid



If you use it with double quotes, the startup scripts get messed up and don't even start up the JobManager/TaskManagers anymore:


env.java.opts: "-Dio.netty.leakDetectionLevel=paranoid"



This applies to all configuration values with double quotes and is there a seperate issue than FLINK-942. I just noticed it by chance for the JVM args.
