2. Problem repetition

a. Make AM run in node1;

b. Do NM decomission for node1

3. Problem



We can see form the pic above, last AM saved chk-1522 at 2020-03-04 14:12:48. Then the second AM restarted with chk-1. But at last, we find data is not correct. So we restarted the application from chk-1522 manually with flink cli -s, then we confirmed the data is right.

Do as above, we find that AM restarted, but the flink job is not restart from the saved checkpoint.So is it normal or are there some configurations that I have not configed?
