The web frontend always displays for the latest finished job in the history that it has an accumulator with name JobID (SerializedListAccumulator) and value org.apache.flink.api.common.accumulators.SerializedListAccumulator. This seems to an artifact of the way we send accumulators via akka. Maybe the SerializedListAccumulator is always collected in the JobManager's AccumulatorManager no matter whether the job used accumulators or not. Then, this accumulator is returned to the web frontend as long as no other job was started.
