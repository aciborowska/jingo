We tried the quickstart on two PCs with different Flink versions (0.8-SNAPSHOT and 0.7), but if we submit the generated Jar-File in the web interface the error always is:


Neither a 'Main-Class', nor a 'program-class' entry was found in the jar file.
org.apache.flink.client.program.ProgramInvocationException: Neither a 'Main-Class', nor a 'program-class' entry was found in the jar file.
at org.apache.flink.client.program.PackagedProgram.getEntryPointClassNameFromJar(PackagedProgram.java:453)
	at org.apache.flink.client.program.PackagedProgram.(PackagedProgram.java:133)



Something is wrong with the pom.xml's, but I was unable to figure it out.
