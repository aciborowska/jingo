This change aims at simplifying the StreamTask class by exposing directly the TimeServiceProvider to the operators being executed. 

This implies removing the registerTimer() and getCurrentProcessingTime() methods from the StreamTask. Now, to register a timer and query the time, each operator will be able to get the TimeServiceProvider and call the corresponding methods directly on it.

In addition, this will simplify many of the tests which now implement their own time providers.
