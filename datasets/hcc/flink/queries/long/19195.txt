Hi All,

Sorry if this is the wrong place but I was in github, website and other places and I could not find what I was looking for.

I'm starting to learn about flink and I'm using this image for some of my explorations:

docker pull amd64/flink:1.11-scala_2.11-java11

 

I'm using it in our development cluster in my company and when generating my image based on this I get some errors from the security report (from an external provider) that prevent me from generating an image (it's something on our side).

 

I just wanted to know if this is indeed an error and it could be fixed in the future.

This is what I got:

CVE Package Version Severity Status CVSS

— ------- ------- -------- ------ ----

CVE-2019-20444 io.netty_netty-codec 4.1.34.Final critical fixed in 4.1.44 9.1

CVE-2019-20445 io.netty_netty-codec 4.1.34.Final critical fixed in 4.1.44 9.1

CVE-2020-11612 io.netty_netty-codec 4.1.34.Final critical fixed in 4.1.46 9.8

CVE-2019-16869 io.netty_netty-codec 4.1.34.Final high fixed in 4.1.42.Final 7.5

 

CVE-2019-20444 and CVE-2019-20445 in theory was fixed in FLINK-16961 but I still see it in my report.

 
CVE-2020-11612 and CVE-2019-16869 I found it in FLINK-16356 but this one is still open.

So I was just wondering if maybe FLINK-16961 fixed only some of the components but some others are still being used?


If I searched in github I found this problematic versions in:

flink-connector-cassandra (io.netty:netty-codec:4.1.44.Final)
flink-connector-elasticsearch5 (io.netty:netty-codec:4.1.44.Final)
flink-python - (io.netty:netty-codec:4.1.42.Final)
