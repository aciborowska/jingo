Due to the bug of http-core:4..46 (we current use) HTTPCORE-446, it may cause the bug of deadLock, we should upgrade the version.

Background:
We have a custom connector whose parent project is flink-parent, which cause the dependency of all connector sdk's http-client version and  http core version become consistent with the version in DependencyManagement section. It costs us a lot to debug the problem due to HTTPCORE-446 in our production environment.
