I would like to send json as an argument to my program, but when submitting it via the REST API, all the quotes in the json are gone, resulting in invalid json.

The JarActionHandler.tokenizeArguments should only remove the leading and trailing quotes of an argument, not all of the quotes.

Current workaround:  Replace the quotes in json with an escape character and replace them back in the run method.
