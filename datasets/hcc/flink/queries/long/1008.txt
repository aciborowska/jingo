After calling createProgramPlan() I get the following exception:
java.lang.RuntimeException: No data sinks have been created yet. A program needs at least one sink that consumes data. Examples are writing the data set or printing it.
	at eu.stratosphere.api.java.ExecutionEnvironment.createProgramPlan(ExecutionEnvironment.java:618)
	at eu.stratosphere.api.java.LocalEnvironment.execute(LocalEnvironment.java:51)
	at eu.stratosphere.api.java.ExecutionEnvironment.execute(ExecutionEnvironment.java:516)

The plan execute and we also have data sinks, so the error is really confusing.
