The following example would fail:


create table src (x int, y string);
create table dest (x int) partitioned by (p string, q string);
insert into dest partition (p='a') select * from src order by x limit 10;


The error is: "INSERT INTO <table> PARTITION statement only support SELECT clause for now"
