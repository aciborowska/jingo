When the job manager is shut down, it calls cancelAndClearEverything. This method does not cancel the ExecutionGraph instances, but fail}}s them, which can lead to {{ExecutionGraph restart.

I've noticed this in tests, where old graph got into a loop of restarts.

What I don't understand is why the futures etc. are not cancelled when the executor service is shut down.
