The RocksDBStateBackend extracts the RocksDB jni library from the RocksDB dependency in a temp directory (see RocksDBStateBackend#ensureRocksDBIsLoaded). This file is, however, never removed. 

In general, I think we should add a cleanup mechanism which cleans all Task specific files after the Task has completed. The same applies to the TaskManager.
