The following SQL does not compile:
invalid_having_hop_start_sql
SELECT 
  c AS k, 
  COUNT(a) AS v, 
  HOP_START(rowtime, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE) AS windowStart, 
  HOP_END(rowtime, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE) AS windowEnd 
FROM 
  T1 
GROUP BY 
  HOP(rowtime, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE), 
  c 
HAVING 
  SUM(b) > 1


While individually keeping HAVING clause or HOP_START field compiles and runs without issue.
