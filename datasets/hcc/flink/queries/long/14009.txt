With FLINK-13968 we introduced an automatic NOTICE-binary file check. However, since we don't use the correct NOTICE-binary file (FLINK-14008) for Scala 2.12 it fails currently our cron jobs.

I suggest to only enable the automatic NOTICE-binary files for Scala 2.11 until FLINK-14008 has been fixed.
