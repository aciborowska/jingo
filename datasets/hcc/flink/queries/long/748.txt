the static writeString() method in StringValue adds an offset of 1 to differentiate between null and "". while the readString() method accounts for this, the non-static read()/write() methods do not.

this currently causes issues in the StringComparator, which uses writeString() to serialize but read() to deserialize, causing it to read an additional character.

is there a reason why these methods behave differently?
