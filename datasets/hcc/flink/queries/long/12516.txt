Currently, our Travis tests are running with a trusty environment which is officially not supported by Ubuntu anymore. It also brings old system libraries which blocks unit tests for FLINK-11579.

I propose to update to xenial (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) which is still supported until 2021-04.

Since Travis doesn't support oraclejdk8 on xenial, however, this also implies a switch to openJDK 8.
