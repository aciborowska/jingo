This line in StreamExecutionEnvironment.scala was changed to remove the `returns` call starting in version 1.9.0. This causes subsequent transformations on the stream to fail since the return TypeInformation isn't set anymore.

 

Looks like the change was made in this pr. Guessing it was a mistake unless there's some reason to do this that I'm not understanding.

 

I'm willing to make the PR to fix it, just need it changed so we can start upgrading our microservices to 1.9.
