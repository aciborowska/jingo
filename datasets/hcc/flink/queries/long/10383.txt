The S3 connectors are based on a self-contained shaded Hadoop. By design, they should only use config value from the Flink configuration.

However, because Hadoop loads implicitly configs from the classpath, existing "core-site.xml" files can interfere with the configuration in ways intransparent for the user. We should ensure such configs are not loaded.
