Please reenable the secondary ordering as it is essential for data cleansing algorithms.

To reproduce, given input:
(1, x, b)
(1, y, c)
(1, z, a)
And reducer on first field with secondary sort on last, I would expect to get the ordering
(1, z, a)
(1, x, b)
(1, y, c)
But I receive the original order.

I could provide a TestPlan test case.
