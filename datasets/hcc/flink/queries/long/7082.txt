Implement a generic entry point for Flink sessions. This ClusterEntryPoint has to start a ResourceManager, the Dispatcher component and the cluster's RESTful endpoint. This class could serve as the basis for a Mesos- and YarnEntryPoint to run Flink sessions.

Maybe we can use a common base for the session and the per-job mode. The session has to start a dispatcher component and the per-job mode retrieves the JobGraph and directly starts a JobManager with this job.
