This is a bug in https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1153.

In case of multiple job managers, the user jars need to be accessible by all job managers (including those who arrive later).

Since #1153 requires the file state backend to be configured, the simplest solution is to make the blob server aware of the configured recovery mode and put/get/delete the user jars from the file state backend as well.
