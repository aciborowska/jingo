My job consumes the data in kafka and then processes the data. After the job lasts for a while, the following error appears: 

ERROR org.apache.flink.runtime.util.FatalExitExceptionHandler - FATAL: Thread 'flink-metrics-akka.remote.default-remote-dispatcher-3' produced an uncaught exception. Stopping the process...
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory

i have set the "max.poll.records" propertity is "250", and it does not work.
