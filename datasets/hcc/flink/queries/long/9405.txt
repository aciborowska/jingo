History server only seems to report Flink jobs that are cancelled via the UI or the Flink command line. For the case when the Flink Yarn cluster itself is stopped (by killing the Yarn application e.g.) I do not see the job show up in the History Server (It is not shown in configured location historyserver.archive.fs.dir as well). 

Thankfully, the yarn application logs is moved to a HDFS location thanks to Yarn, but with that we lose out the UI and the additional features that I get via the History Server.
