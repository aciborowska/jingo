When I execute the scriptÂ ./build_docs.sh, it throws the following exception:



Liquid Exception: Could not locate the included file 'generated/rocks_db_native_metric_configuration.html' in any of ["/Users/duanchen/sourcecode/flink/docs/_includes"]. Ensure it exists in one of those directories and, if it is a symlink, does not point outside your site source. in ops/config.md



It seems `rocks_db_native_metric_configuration` has been renamed to `rocksdb_native_metric_configuration.html`, but it has not been synchronized in ops/config.md
