I get an error when I'm trying to cancel a job a flink job with a savepoint. The problem is that it takes longer than 10 seconds to take the save point so I get an exception "Ask timed out on [Actor[akka://...]] after [10000 ms].", I have attached the full error message in the file link-1.6.0-cancel-timeout.txt.

I have set akka.client.timeout and akka.ask.timeout in flink-conf.yaml but they do not seem to be used. 

It worked fine to set  akka.client.timeout and akka.ask.timeout in flink-conf.yaml  with flink 1.4.2 but it does not seem to work with flink 1.6.0.
