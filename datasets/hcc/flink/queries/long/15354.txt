Currently, we start minikube in nightly.sh for every e2e test, and it will never be stopped. It is unnecessary and will occupy some resources on travis. I think the minikube should only be started in the kubernetes related test(test_kubernetes_embedded_job.sh) and need to be stopped once the test finished.
