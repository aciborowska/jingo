Now in ExecutionGraphHolder, which is used in many handlers, we use a WeakHashMap to cache ExecutionGraph(s), which is only sensitive to garbage collection.

The latency is too high when JVM do GC rarely, which will make status of jobs or its tasks unmatched with the real ones.

LoadingCache is a common used cache implementation from guava lib, we can use its time based eviction to lower latency of status update.
