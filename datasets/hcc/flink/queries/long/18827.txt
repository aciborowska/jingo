For the following job:


val t_env = TableEnvironment.create(new EnvironmentSettings.Builder().inBatchMode().useBlinkPlanner().build())
    val sourceDdl = """
      create table Orders(
        a VARCHAR,
        b BIGINT,
        c BIGINT,
        rowtime TIMESTAMP(3),
        WATERMARK FOR rowtime AS rowtime - INTERVAL '1' SECOND
      ) with (
        'connector' = 'filesystem',
      'format' = 'csv',
      'path' = '/tmp'
      )"""
t_env.executeSql(sourceDdl)
val orders = t_env.from("Orders")
print(orders.getSchema)



the schema of table "orders" is as following:


root
 |-- a: STRING
 |-- b: BIGINT
 |-- c: BIGINT
 |-- rowtime: TIMESTAMP(3)
 |-- WATERMARK FOR rowtime AS `rowtime` - INTERVAL '1' SECOND



We can see that the type of field 'rowtime' is regular TIMESTAMP which is not expected.
