It is not possible to remove an existing table property from a table.
Looking at the source code this seems to be the intended semantics, but it seems counter-intuitive to me.

If I create a table with the following statement:



CREATE TABLE `testTable` (
  id INT
)
WITH (
    'connector.type' = 'kafka',
    'connector.version' = 'universal',
    'connector.topicX' = 'test',      -- Woops, I made a typo here
    [...]
)


The statement will be successfully executed. However, the table cannot be used due to the typo.

Fixing the typo with the following DDL is not possible:



ALTER TABLE `testTable` SET (
    'connector.type' = 'kafka',
    'connector.version' = 'universal',
    'connector.topic' = 'test',      -- Fixing the typo
)



because the key connector.topicX is not removed.

Right now it seems that the only way to fix a table with an invalid key is to DROP and CREATE it. I think that this use case should be supported by ALTER TABLE.
I would even argue that the expected behavior is that previous properties are removed and replaced by the new properties.
