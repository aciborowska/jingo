If the UDF file imports job code directly or indirectly, the PyFlink Job will run into a infinite loop as follows:

	submit job
	execute job
	launch UDF worker
	import UDF
	(If the job file is depended by UDF or imported as the top level module) import job code
	(If the job code is executed outside the "if _name_ == '_main_':") launch gateway server and submit job to local executor
	execute job in local mode
	launch UDF worker
	import UDF
	import job code
 ...
This infinite loop will create new Java processes and Python processes endlessly until the resources on the machine are exhausted. We should fix it ASAP.
