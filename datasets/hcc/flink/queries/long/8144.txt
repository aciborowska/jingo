Currently the logic of RowTimeUnboundedOver is as follows:
1) When element comes, buffer it in MapState and and register a timer at current watermark + 1
2) When event timer triggered, scan the MapState and find the elements below the current watermark and process it. If there are remaining elements to process, register a new timer at current watermark + 1.

Let's assume that watermark comes about 5 seconds later than the event on average, then we will scan about 5000 times the MapState before actually processing the events.
