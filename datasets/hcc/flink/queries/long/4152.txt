While testing Flink 1.1 I've found that the TaskManagers are logging many messages when registering at the JobManager.

This is the log file: https://gist.github.com/rmetzger/0cebe0419cdef4507b1e8a42e33ef294

Its logging more than 3000 messages in less than a minute. I don't think that this is the expected behavior.
