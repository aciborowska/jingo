Dispatcher does not recover jobs on failover (FLIP-6 mode).

Steps to reproduce:

	bin/start-cluster.sh flip6
	bin/flink run -p1 -flip6 examples/batch/WordCount.jar --input /path/to/largefile.txt
	Wait until job is running, then run bin/jobmanager.sh stop flip6 && bin/jobmanager.sh start flip6 to restart the master.
	Wait until leader is elected and verify that no jobs are running.



Analysis

	Dispatcher checks on submitJob whether the job scheduling status is PENDING and only then allows resubmission of the job. However, the job is marked as RUNNING in ZooKeeper.
