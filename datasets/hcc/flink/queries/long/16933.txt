For example, there are two streaming jobs A and B.

When A calculation is running, I submit B, at this time, an exception will be thrown, Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc: clickhouse: // host: 8123 / data. When stopping flink ./stop-cluster.sh. Then restart ./start-cluster.sh. When flink is not running any tasks, submit B, and B is successfully executed. But if you execute B multiple times, Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc: clickhouse: // host: 8123 / data will also be thrown. Both B and A depend on clickhouse4j in the common. A submission can run normally, but B can only be executed when restart and flink does not contain other tasks, which seems strange. I checked flink / lib / and clickhouse4j-1.4.1.jar has been added. I tried to package clickhouse4j-1.4.1.jar into the job, but still couldn't solve this problem. I tried to add it to jre / lib / ext and added it to the classpath. The problem was not solved. But I executed in the local environment idea and did not throw any exception.
