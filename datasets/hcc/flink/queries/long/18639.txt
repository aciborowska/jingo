Shell scripts execute BashJavaUtils for generating memory related JVM parameters and dynamic configurations. When there's a problem in configuration that the memory sizes cannot be properly calculated, the script will not launch the Flink daemon and exit with non-zero code. In such cases, error messages from BashJavaUtils describing the reason of failure are missing, making it hard for users to understand what's wrong and how to fix the problem.
