 The Flink node has been running for 1 month, and it is found that the machine's memory is getting higher and higher, even exceeding the memory configured by the heap. Through top -c, it is found that the machine's memory and virtual memory are very high. It may be an off-heap memory leak. What is the collection mechanism of flink's off-heap memory? It need to start FULL GC to recycle off-heap memory?

In addition, does flink disable off-heap memory by default? taskmanager.memory.off-heap: false, why is the memory still increasing slowly .
