When running the spotbugs plugin (-Dspotbugs) in a sub-module of Flink the build will fail because it cannot find the exclusion file.



[ERROR] Could not find resource 'tools/maven/spotbugs-exclude.xml'. -> [Help 1]



The problem is that the configured relative path is resolved against the sub-module directory, and not the parent one.
