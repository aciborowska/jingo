1. First-time TaskExecutor register to rm successfully. If it fails to send SlotReport to SlotMaanger, TaskExecutor will reconnect to RM again. However, TaskExecutor still uses the old registration id in the EstablishedResourceManagerConnection.

2. Second-time TaskExecutor registers to rm successfully and gets a new registration id.

3. First-round and second-round has a race condition. Since that the task executor maybe use the old registration id in heartbeat with rm.
