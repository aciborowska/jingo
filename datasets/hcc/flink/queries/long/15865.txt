On one hand, the Flink doc suggests to add .uid() call for all operators in [1], on the other hand, it lists all operators in Flink [2]. The issues are:

	KeyBy is listed as an operator, but .keyBy().uid() is not a valid call. This is same for window(), split(), etc.




	addSource(), addSink() are not listed as operators, but we do expect user to call .uid() after addSource() and addSink(), especially in the exact-once scenario.



This creates confusions, esp., for beginners.Â There should be a better definition about which/what kind of operators can have a following uid() call.
