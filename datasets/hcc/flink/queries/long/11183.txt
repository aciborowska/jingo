Hello, 

After upgrading from Flink 1.5.3 to Flink 1.7.0 graphite metrics for memory started reporting wrong numbers. All the jobs are reporting the same memory used. Off heap memory, direct memory, mapped memory is almost the same across all our jobs, for heap memory used all jobs report memory used ~ 30mb? Is that even correct, we've had jobs that die sporadically and it appears they are OOM-ing, but we can't really see it and verify it because of the metrics.

Was there any major change to the metrics collection in flink-graphite-1.7.0? 

 

You can see from the screenshot that it appears all our jobs are using same memory.
