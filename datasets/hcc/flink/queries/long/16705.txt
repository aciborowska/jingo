There is a race condition in LocalExecutor between (a) shutting down the cluster when the job has finished and (b) the client which retrieves the result of the job execution.

This was observed in Beam, running a large test suite with the Flink Runner.

We should make sure the job result retrieval and the cluster shutdown do not interfere.
