The Flink Cassandra connector has a dependency on Netty libraries (via promotion of transitive dependencies by the Maven shade plugin) at version 4.0.33.Final, which disagrees with the version included in Flink of 4.0.27.Final which is included & managed by the parent POM via dependency on netty-all.

Due to use of netty-all, the dependency management doesn't take effect on the individual libraries such as netty-handler, netty-codec, etc.

I suggest that dependency management of Netty should be added for all Netty libraries individually (netty-handler, etc.) so that all Flink modules use the same version, and similarly I suggest that exclusions be added to the quickstart example POM for the individual Netty libraries so that fat JARs don't include conflicting versions of Netty.

It seems like this problem started when FLINK-6084 was implemented: transitive dependencies of the flink-connector-cassandra were previously omitted, and now that they are included we must make sure that they agree with the Flink distribution.
