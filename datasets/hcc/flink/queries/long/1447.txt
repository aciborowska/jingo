Hi 

I have the Hadoop 2 version of Flink and I tried to use the Flink Web Submission Client to submit a job.

This is on Ubuntu 14.04 with Fireforx 35. "Mozilla Firefox for Ubuntu"

When I upload a jar I dont see the jar in the options to select as a program to run.

Since I am running Ubuntu on a virtual Machine using VMware Player,  I tried to access the console from my windows host.  This clearly shows me the Program.  I have tried to attach this screenshot.
