With FLINK-12147 we bumped influxdb-java from version 2.14 to 2.16. At the same time we fix the okio dependency to version 1.14.0. Since influxdb-java transitive dependency converter-moshi:jar:2.6.1 requires moshi:jar:1.8.0 which requires okio:jar:1.16.0, the influxdb metric reporter fails as described here. We should fix this incompatibility by removing the dependency management entry for okio.
