On the k8s+docker environment, the 1 jobmanager container and 5 taskmanager container are the standalone cluster modes.

But for some reason, the jobmanager is rebooted, and two of the remaining three taskmanger are also rebooted, and two of the remaining three taskmanger don't connect to jobmanager, resulting in insufficient slot resources reporting errors.

The attachments are the jobmanager log, two disconnected taskmanger logs, and all available and unavailable taskmanager screenshots of flink at the time.

It is strange that two rebooted taskmanger can connect with jobmanager, and one of the three unrebooted taskamanagers can connect.

Why?Can the cause of the restart be analyzed from the log?thank you
