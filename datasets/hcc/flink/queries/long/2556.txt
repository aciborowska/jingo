The pre-flight key validation checks are inconsistent, at times don't actually check anything and in at least 1 case are done redundantly.

For example,

	you can group on a tuple containing a non-Atomic-/CompositeType using String[] KeyExpressions (see FLINK-2541)
	you can group on an AtomicType even though isKeyType() returns false, if it is contained in a tuple
	for distinct(String[]...) the above fails in the DistinctOperator constructor, as it validates the key again for some reason.
