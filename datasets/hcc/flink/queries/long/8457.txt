The documentation for how to build Flink from source is broken for all released versions.

It only explains how to build the latest master branch which is only correct for the docs of the latest master but not for the docs of a release version. For example the build docs for Flink 1.4 say

This page covers how to build Flink 1.4.0 from sources.

but explain how to build the master branch. 

I think we should rewrite this page to explain how to build specific versions and also explain how to build the SNAPSHOT branches of released versions (for example release-1.4, the latest dev branch for Flink 1.4 with all merged bug fix).

I guess the same holds for Flink 1.3 as well.
