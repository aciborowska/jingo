flink-orc provides a -jar-with-dependencies.jar variant which ships binaries.
However, these binaries are not documented in META-INF/NOTICE.
There are two similar files in that directory (NOTICE from force-shading and NOTICE.txt from Commons Lang). 

There is a NOTICE file that looks valid, but it is in META-INF/services.


I assume this has been introduced in FLINK-17460.
