As described in documentation[1], a csv format can use 'format.line-delimiter' = '\n' to specify line delimiter. However, the property value is parsed into two characters "\n" , this result to reading failed. There is no workaround for now, unless fix it. The delimiter should be unescaped, e.g. using StringEscapeUtils.unescapeJava. Note that both old csv and new csv have the same problem, and both field-delimiter and line-delimiter.
