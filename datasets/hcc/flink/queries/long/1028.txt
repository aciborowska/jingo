When I throw a RuntimeException in a user code method I get the Exception in my IDE or on the terminal (when using the CLI client). When I throw an exception in the constructor of a TypeComparator the exception is only logged but not presented to the user. The code continues and at some later point fails with something that seems unrelated, making it very hard to find the original cause.

Does anyone know why it is like that? Is it like this on purpose?
