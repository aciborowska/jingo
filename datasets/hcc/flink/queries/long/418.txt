This is a first step towards realizing the functionality requested in issue (#66 | FLINK-66) in the runtime, building upon the API proposed in PR (#383 | FLINK-383).

Broadcast variables are realized as additional outputs attached to a `RegularPactTask`. Convenience methods for accessing the configuration information for broadcast input setup was added to the `TaskConfig`.

An integrated test case for with a simple hardwired JobGraph can be found in `BoradcastVarsNepheleITCase`.
