While migrating the flink-java8 module into the corresponding classes (see FLINK-7251), I noticed that org.apache.flink.runtime.util.JarFileCreator is unable to deal with Java  Method References. I don't know if this class is still necessary as it is only used in test scope. This issue is just to track this known bug.
