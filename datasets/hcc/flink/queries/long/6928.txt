When using a Kafka sink, the defaultTopic needs to exist even when it is never used. It would be nice if fetching partition information for the default topic would be delayed until the moment a topic is actually used.

Cause: FlinkKafkaProducerBase.open fetches partition information for the default topic.

In addition, it would be nice if we could signal that the defaultTopic is not needed by passing null. Currently, a value for the defaultTopic is required.
