Using DC/OS with Flink service in current development (https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-flink-service). For reproduction:
1. Install a DC/OS cluster
2. Follow the instruction on mentioned repo for setting up a universe server with the flink app.
3. Install the flink app via the universe
4. Access the Web UI
5. Upload a job

Experience:
The upload reaches 100%, and then says "Saving..." forever.

Upload works when using ssh forwarding to access the node directly serving the Flink Web UI.

DC/OS uses a proxy to access the Web UI. The webpage is delivered by a component called the "Admin Router".

Side note:
Interestingly also the new favicon does not appear.
