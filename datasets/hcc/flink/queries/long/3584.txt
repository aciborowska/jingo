When running a Flink (streaming) application there is a very nice graphical representation of the flow in the jobtracker webinterface.

We found that when using Firefox we can move and scale this graphics very nicely and also there are arrows between the boxes that show which direction the data flows.

When using Google Chrome to look at the exact same data we find that we can scale the image but not move it around. And the arrows are missing.

Something that doesn't work in both cases (but what we do expect should work) is the option to move up/down the separator between the graphical at the top and the textual overview at the bottom. Or is this simply a missing feature?
