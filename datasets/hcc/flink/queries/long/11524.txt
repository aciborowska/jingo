The LeaderChangeClusterComponentsTest.testReelectionOfJobMaster failed on Travis: https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/488578456/log.txt

It looks as if the JobMaster cannot reconnect to the ResourceManager. Maybe this is caused by a wrong interleaving of the revoke and grant leadership calls to the TestingEmbeddedHaServices.
