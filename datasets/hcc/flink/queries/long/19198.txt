The default value for `streaming-source.consume-start-offset` in Hive streaming is `1970-00-00`(see [docs](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/table/hive/hive_streaming.html#streaming-source-consume-start-offset)), which is not a valid date.Â 

It does not affect the current execution though, since it's converted to milliseconds afterward (which is. -2764800000). But still it's not a good default, and we should change it to `1970-01-01`.
