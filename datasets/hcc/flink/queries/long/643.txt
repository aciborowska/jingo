I added Delta Iterations to the new Java API ((#607 | FLINK-607)). Moreover I implemented a simple Delta PageRank Example and created a testcase with it. The example also shows how the new syntax for delta iterations looks like.

My branch is based on PullRequest (#638 | FLINK-638), since it already included some of the compiler post pass logic for delta iterations.
