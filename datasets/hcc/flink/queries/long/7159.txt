According to http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~len/sql1999.pdf

ISO/IEC 9075-2:1999 (E) Â©ISO/IEC, 8.12 <overlaps predicate>


The result of the <overlaps predicate> is the result of the following expression:
( S1 > S2 AND NOT ( S1 >= T2 AND T1 >= T2 ) )
OR
( S2 > S1 AND NOT ( S2 >= T1 AND T2 >= T1 ) )
OR
( S1 = S2 AND ( T1 <> T2 OR T1 = T2 ) )



The Table API diverges from this semantic.
