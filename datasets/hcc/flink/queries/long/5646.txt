The 1.2 release documentation (https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.2/monitoring/rest_api.html)  states "It is possible to upload, run, and list Flink programs via the REST APIs and web frontend". However there is no documentation about uploading a jar via REST api. 
There should be something to the effect of:
"You can upload a jar file using http post with the file data sent under a form field 'jarfile'."
