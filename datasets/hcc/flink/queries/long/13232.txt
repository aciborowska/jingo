TemporalTypesTest>ExpressionTestBase.evaluateExprs in blink planner seems to have a bug on timezone.

When I run it locally at PST timezone, it always fails as:



[ERROR] Failures:
[ERROR]   TemporalTypesTest>ExpressionTestBase.evaluateExprs:154 Wrong result for: [CURRENT_DATE] optimized to: [CURRENT_DATE] expected:<2019-07-1[2]> but was:<2019-07-1[1]>



I didn't find it fails on travis. Thus I suspect there's a bug w.r.t. timezone.
