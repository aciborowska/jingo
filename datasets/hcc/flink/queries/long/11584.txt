I just tried adding this configuration


    public static final ConfigOption<String> SSL_PROVIDER =
        key("security.ssl.provider")
            .defaultValue("JDK")
            .withDescription(Description.builder()
                    .text("The SSL engine provider to use for the ssl transport:")
                    .list(
                        TextElement.text("%s: default Java-based SSL engine", TextElement.code("JDK")),
                        TextElement.text("%s: openSSL-based SSL engine using system libraries"
                            + " (falls back to JDK if not available)", TextElement.code("OPENSSL"))
                    ).linebreak()
                    .text("Please note: OPENSSL requires a custom build of %s in our " +
                        "shaded package namespace which is not (yet) available but can be built manually (see %s).",
                        link("http://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html#wiki-h2-4", "netty-tcnative"),
                        link("https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11579", "FLINK-11579"))
                    .build()
                );


and was presented with java.lang.AssertionError: Documentation is outdated, please regenerate it according to the instructions in flink-docs/README.md. in ConfigOptionsDocsCompletenessITCase even though I did regenerate the docs. As it turns out, the line break is rendered differently: <br/> (supposed) vs. <br> (documented). Strangely, DescriptionHtmlTest#testDescriptionWithLineBreak does verify the supposed variant, so I don't know what's wrong here.
