The Kafka consumer and producer do not  call the open methods of plain (De)SerializationSchema interfaces. Only the Keyed and Kafka specific interfaces. The updated SQL implementations such as AvroRowDataSeriailzationSchema use these methods and so SQL queries using avro and kafka will fail in a null pointer exception.
