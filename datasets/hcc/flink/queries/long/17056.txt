Each benchmark class is accompanied by an according public static main (String[] args) method which should run all benchmarks in that class. However, it just uses the class' simple name in a regexp like ".<name>." and may thus also match further classes that were not intended to run. An example for this is the StreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor which also runs benchmarks from DataSkewStreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor. Using the canonical name instead fixes that behaviour.
