I have a join inside a delta iteration, which hangs, i.e.I think it's deadlocked.
If I do the join without a delta iteration, it works.

Why I think it's a deadlock:

	no output in the logs
	CPU idles
	no IO (measured using iotop)
	stacktrace (when starting in debug mode and stopping at arbitrary points) locks deadlockish 



Join properties:

	size of the operands: 6.1 GB, 257 MB
	estimated result size: 50 MB
	the deadlock only occurs for big inputs, if I decrease the size of the first operand to something smaller, e.g. 1MB, it works.



I am using the Scala API.

Let me know, which further information you need. The code is basically the one I posted on the mailing list, but I could provide a compilable version if thats necessary.
