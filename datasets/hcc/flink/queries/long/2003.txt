The classnames generated from the build system can be too long.
Creating too long filenames in some encrypted filesystems is not possible, including encfs which is what Ubuntu uses.

This the same as this Spark issue

The workaround (taken from the linked issue) is to add in Maven under the compile options: 


+              <arg>-Xmax-classfile-name</arg>
+              <arg>128</arg>



And in SBT add:


+    scalacOptions in Compile ++= Seq("-Xmax-classfile-name", "128"),
