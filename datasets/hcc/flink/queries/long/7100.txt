TaskManager metrics are currently registered twice, once when the TaskManager is started and once when the TaskManager associates with a JobManager.

Originally the metrics were registered when the TM associates with the JM and unregistered upon disassociation.

9e9776f17ed18b12af177e31ab0bc266236f85ef modified the TaskManager to use the TaskManagerServices, which when loaded also register the metrics.

I suggest to remove the registrations that happen upon (dis-)association.
