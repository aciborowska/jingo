Nephele has in many scripts hints to Java to run an IPv4 stack. If I recall correctly, the hint was necessary for the discovery manager broadcast-message-discovery in cloud setups.

Since we do not use that mechanism any more, we should be able to remove these hints from the scripts and test setups.
