Hello,

I created a Google Groups-based mailing list for all ozone developers.

You can find the Group here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stratosphere-dev
The address of the mailing list is: stratosphere-dev@googlegroups.com

This is not any kind of official mailing list or so. I did not ask anybody for "permission" to create it. I just have the feeling that we need a tool to discuss things which are not an actual issue or question.
I know that there is already an official list for stratosphere. (But its not really used, its TU hosted and not publicly available (or the archives are not working))

If we want to be an open open-source project, every discussion should be publicly available.
