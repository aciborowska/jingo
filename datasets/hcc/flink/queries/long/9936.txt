When deployed in mesos session cluster mode, the connector monitor keeps reporting unable to connect to mesos after restart.Â In fact, scheduler driver already connected to mesos master, but when the connected message is lost. This is because leadership is not granted yet and fence id is not set, the rpc service ignores the connected message. So we should connect to mesos master after leadership is granted.
