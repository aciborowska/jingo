The description of watermark strategy is wrong in doc[1]

	Strictly ascending timestamps: WATERMARK FOR rowtime_column AS rowtime_column.



Emits a watermark of the maximum observed timestamp so far. Rows that have a timestamp smaller to the max timestamp are not late.

	Ascending timestamps: WATERMARK FOR rowtime_column AS rowtime_column - INTERVAL '0.001' SECOND.
 Emits a watermark of the maximum observed timestamp so far minus 1. Rows that have a timestamp equal and smaller to the max timestamp are not late.
