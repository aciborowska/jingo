https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/api/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/scala/KeyedStream.html results in a 404 error.

The problem (https://ci.apache.org/builders/flink-docs-master/builds/731/steps/Java%20&%20Scala%20docs/logs/stdio) is the following:


[ERROR] Failed to execute goal net.alchim31.maven:scala-maven-plugin:3.2.2:compile (doc) on project flink-annotations: wrap: org.apache.maven.artifact.resolver.ArtifactNotFoundException: Could not find artifact com.typesafe.genjavadoc:genjavadoc-plugin_2.10.6:jar:0.8 in central (https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2)



I think the problem is that we upgraded the scala version to 2.10.6, but the plugin doesn't have version 0.8 for that scala version.
