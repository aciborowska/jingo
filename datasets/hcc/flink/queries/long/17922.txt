Now the underlying rules are:

	HiveCatalog.createTable , hive table has false of isGeneric flag, generic table has no flag.
	HiveCatalog.getTable , generic table has true of isGeneric flag, hive table has no flag.



It is very difficult to understand and easy to cause bugs.

Whether it's createTable or getTable of HiveCatalog, there should be two types of objects that are consistent: HiveCatalogTable and Flink CatalogTableImpl.

Timo: From a logical perspective, the HiveCatalog should deal with this additional property while storing and retrieving a CatalogTable. The isGeneric should not travel through the stack of regular Flink connector options. It is an internal property from the HiveCatalog through a custom HiveCatalogTable to a custom HiveFactory. It should be stored as a member variable in a HiveCatalogTable.
