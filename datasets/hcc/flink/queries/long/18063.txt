There are three aborting scenarios which might encounter race condition:

    1. CheckpointBarrierUnaligner#processCancellationBarrier

    2. CheckpointBarrierUnaligner#processEndOfPartition

    3. AlternatingCheckpointBarrierHandler#processBarrier

We only consider the pending checkpoint triggered by #processBarrier from task thread to abort it. Actually the checkpoint might also be triggered by #notifyBarrierReceived from netty thread in race condition, so we should also handle properly to abort it.
