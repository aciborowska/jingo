Several test runs fail with the watchdog killing the tests after receiving no output for 300s showing EventTimeWindowCheckpointingITCase.testPreAggregatedSlidingTimeWindow as one of the tests, sometimes with another test running in parallel. It does not seem to be hanging though and the only reason for this behaviour may be that the tests, especially with RocksDB, take very long with no output by each of the test methods in AbstractEventTimeWindowCheckpointingITCase. Thus adding output per method should fix the spurious test failures.
