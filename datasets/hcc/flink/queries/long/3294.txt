Currently, the 0.8 consumer for Kafka is committing the offsets manually into Zookeeper so that users can track the lag using external tools.

The 0.8 consumer has a pluggable design, and this component is easily pluggable.
Since OffsetCommitRequest version=1 (supported in 0.8.2 or later), users can choose between two offset commit modes:
a) Let the broker commit into ZK (this is  what we are doing from the consumer
b) Let the broker commit the offset into a special topic.

By adding a different "OffsetHandler" backend, users can commit offsets from the brokers (reducing the total number of ZK connections) or into the broker's offset topic.
