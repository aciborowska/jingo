Suppose state.backend.rocksdb.localdir is configured as:

state.backend.rocksdb.localdir: /flink/tmp


If I then run rm -rf /flink/tmp/job_*Â on a host while a Flink application is running, I will observe the following:

	throughput of my operators running on that host will drop to zero
	the application will not fail or restart
	the task manager will not fail or restart
	in most cases there is nothing in the logs to indicate a failure (I've run this several times and only once seen an exception - I believe I was lucky and deleted those directories during a checkpoint or something)



The desired behaviour here would be to throw an exception and crash, instead of silently dropping throughput to zero. Restarting the Task Manager will resolve the issues.

I only tried this on Flink 1.8.1 and 1.9.0.
