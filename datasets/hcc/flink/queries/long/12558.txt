I run a flink SocketWindowWordCount job on yarn cluste mode, when I kill the socket, the flink job can't stopped. and I can't reproduct the bug again.

 

Steps 1


nc -lk 9999


Steps 2


bin/flink run -m yarn-cluster -yn 2 examples/streaming/SocketWindowWordCount.jar --hostname 10.101.52.12 --port 9999


Steps 3
 cancel the above nc command

Steps 4
 every thing gone
