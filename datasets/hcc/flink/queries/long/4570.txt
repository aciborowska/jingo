The style check fails undeterministically in flink-mesos/src/test/scala/org/apache/flink/mesos/Utils.scala

It sometimes fails in the nightly builds without any changes to the code which lets the style check fail. Not reproduceable locally.

Could be related to upgrading Scalastyle from 0.5.0 to 0.8.0. As a first step, I will just lower the Scalastyle version to 0.5.0 again.
