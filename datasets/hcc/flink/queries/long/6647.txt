Currently:

	setup "state.backend.rocksdb.checkpointdir=hdfs:///some/base/path/hdfs"
	setup backend: state.backend: "org.apache.flink.contrib.streaming.state.RocksDBStateBackendFactory"
	rocksdb doesn't support hdfs backend so in logs:

2017-05-19 15:42:33,737 ERROR org.apache.flink.contrib.streaming.state.RocksDBStateBackend - Local DB files directory '/some/base/path/hdfs' does not exist and cannot be created.


	however job continue execution and IOManager temp directory will be picked up for rocksdb files.



There are several issues with such approach:

	after "ERROR" message printed and before developer fixes configuration, /tmp directory/partition might run out of disk space.
	if hdfs base path is the same as local path, then no errors in logs and rocksdb files will be written into an incorrect location. For example: "hdfs:///home/flink/data" will cause an issue.



Expected:

	validate URI and throw IllegalArgumentException like already implemented in "RocksDBStateBackend.setDbStoragePaths" method.
