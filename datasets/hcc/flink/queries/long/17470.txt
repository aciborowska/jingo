Hi Flink team!

We've attempted to upgrade our flink 1.9 cluster to 1.10, but are experiencing reproducible instability on shutdown. Speciically, it appears that the `kill` issued in the `stop` case of flink-daemon.sh is causing the task executor process to hang permanently. Specifically, the process seems to be hanging in the `org.apache.flink.runtime.util.JvmShutdownSafeguard$DelayedTerminator.run` in a `Thread.sleep()` call. I think this is a bizarre behavior. Also note that every thread in the process is BLOCKED. on a `pthread_cond_wait` call. Is this an OS level issue? Banging my head on a wall here. See attached stack traces for details.
