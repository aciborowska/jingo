The CollectionInputFormat uses only the standard serialization means provided by the JVM. Thus data types which are serializable with a TypeSerializer but does not implement the Serializable interface cannot be used with a CollectionDataSource. Even worse, if one uses an aggregation type such as a tuple, only the top level object will be checked for serializability. Consequently, it will crash at runtime.

It would be more user friendly to not enforce that a used data type has to implement the Serializable interface. Instead we should use the generated TypeSerializer to do the serialization. That way, we are more flexible.
