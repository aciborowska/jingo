Build a flink based on the latest code from master branch. And I get the flink binary of flink-1.6-SNAPSHOT. When I run ./start-cluster.sh by the default flink-conf.yaml. I can not start the process and get the error below.



 [root@ricezhang-pjhzf bin]# ./start-cluster.sh 
>> Starting cluster.
>> Starting standalonesession daemon on host ricezhang-pjhzf.vclound.com.
>> : Temporary failure in name resolutionost



By the way, I build this flink from a windows computer. And copy that folder flink-1.6-SNAPSHOT to centos.
