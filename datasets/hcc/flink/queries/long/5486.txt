Here is related code:

      handlePendingFilesForPreviousCheckpoints(bucketState.pendingFilesPerCheckpoint);

      synchronized (bucketState.pendingFilesPerCheckpoint) {
        bucketState.pendingFilesPerCheckpoint.clear();
      }



The handlePendingFilesForPreviousCheckpoints() call should be enclosed inside the synchronization block. Otherwise during the processing of handlePendingFilesForPreviousCheckpoints(), some entries of the map may be cleared.
