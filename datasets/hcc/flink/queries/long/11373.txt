The CliFrontend seems to only print the first message in the strace trace and not any of its causes.


bin/flink run /non-existing/path
Could not build the program from JAR file.

Use the help option (-h or --help) to get help on the command.



Notice, the underlying cause of this message is FileNotFoundException.

Consider changing 
a) the error message for this particular case 
b) the way the stack trace messages are trimmed
