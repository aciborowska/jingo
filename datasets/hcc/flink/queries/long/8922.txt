We need to revertÂ FLINK-8859 because it causes problems with RocksDB that make our automated tests fail on Travis. The change looks actually good and it is currently unclear why this can introduce such a problem. This might also be a Rocks in RocksDB. Nevertheless, for the sake of a proper release testing, we should revert the change for now.
