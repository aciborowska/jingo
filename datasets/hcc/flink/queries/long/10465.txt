When tearing down the DB, we tear down all services supervised by runit. However when running the tests in Docker, sshd is under supervision by runit. When sshd is stopped, the tests cannot be continued because the control node cannot interact with the DB nodes anymore.

How to reproduce
Run command below in control-node container:


./docker/run-tests.sh 1 [...]/flink/flink-1.6.1/flink-1.6.1-bin-hadoop28-scala_2.11.tgz



Expected behavior
sshd should never be stopped
