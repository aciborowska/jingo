I think we should rename the input and output formats because the names are misleading. Delimited*Format sounds like a CSV style input format, but it is a line input format. Record Input Format has no intuitive meaning to most people.

How about we name them

	RecordInputFormat to CSVInputFormat (even though delimiters are not necessarily commas)
	DelimitedInputFormat to LineInputFormat
