Flink currently does not clean up all checkpoint directories when a job reaches a globally terminal state. Having configured the checkpoint directory checkpoints, I observe that after cancelling the job JOB_ID there are still



checkpoints/JOB_ID/shared
checkpoints/JOB_ID/taskowned



I think it would be good if would delete checkpoints/JOB_ID
