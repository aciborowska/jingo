The sql statement is as below.

SELECT k AS key, SUM(p) AS pv, SUM(u) AS uv
FROM (
 SELECT concat_ws('|', udf_pcmplat(site_id), action, position_mark, udf_hour(_time)) AS k
 , COUNT AS p
 , udf_countdistinct(cuid) AS u
 FROM xxxx
 WHERE action NOT IN (
 'unknown', 
 'nil', 
 'null', 
 'UNKNOWN', 
 'NIL', 
 'NULL'
 )
 AND udf_pcmplat(site_id) IS NOT NULL
 GROUP BY md5_2(cuid),udf_hour(_time), udf_pcmplat(site_id), action, position_mark
) t
GROUP BY k

 

This is the error log.



Do you have any idea?
