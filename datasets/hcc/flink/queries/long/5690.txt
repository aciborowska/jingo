Currently distributive contains com/google/protobuf package. Without proper shading client code could fail with:

Caused by: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access method com.google.protobuf.XXXX



Steps to reproduce:

	create job class "com.google.protobuf.TestClass"
	call com.google.protobuf.TextFormat.escapeText(String) method from this class
	deploy job to flink cluster (usign web console for example)
	run job. In logs IllegalAccessError.



Issue in package protected method and different classloaders. TestClass loaded by FlinkUserCodeClassLoader, but TextFormat class loaded by sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader
