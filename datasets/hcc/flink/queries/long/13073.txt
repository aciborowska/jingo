BinaryRow which in blink runtime module has static constant named FIRST_BYTE_ZERO, it's purpose is to filter first byte。

Use 0xFFF0 as a exsample:

its binary sequence is: 1111111111110000。It has 2 problems:

	It can only skip 4 bits of header. If the header is big than 15, then any return long value from pos 0 intersect with FIRST_BYTE_ZERO will not equal to 0. Then will always return true.
	It only can check 8 bit(0-7) of null fields, which left 8-55 bit of null field unchecked.
