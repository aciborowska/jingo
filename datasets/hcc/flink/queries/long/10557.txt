We have seen the following several times, but have not found the root cause. 

The checkpoint size metric will sometimes report the same value over and over, even though the checkpoint size is changing. The last time we saw this, it happened for 4 days, until we re-started the Flink cluster. In that time period, the application flushes all data each day so we would expect to see the checkpoint size grow until UTC midnights, then go to about 0 and begin growing again.

It appears that the metrics continue to be gathered, because we see them in our data repository where we are reporting them. However, the size does not change.  

Is there more information we can gather to root cause this if it happens again?
