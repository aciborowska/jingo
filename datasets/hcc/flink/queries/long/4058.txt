Uploading a JAR with dependencies in a sub-directory causes an" Unable to create temporary file" IOException.  This occurs in org.apache.flink.client.program.PackagedProgram.extractContainedLibraries()

This because of the line "name = name.replace(File.separatorChar, '_');"

File.separatorChar in windows is the backslash () but files read from a Jar are always in the format of the forward slash .  Therefore the slash is never replaced with the '_'.   The fix is to remove the File.separatorChar with '/'.
