The PojoSerializer stores internally the fields of a pojo as Field instances. These field instances are serialized via the FieldSerializer. The FieldSerializer simply writes out the name of the field. When being deserialized, the serializer reads the name and then looks up the field using the dynamically loaded class. If the underlying class changes, e.g. type of fields change, then this won't be noticed, because we don't check the field types. In order to catch errors early and to give meaningful error messages, I think we should add type checks for the reloaded fields.
