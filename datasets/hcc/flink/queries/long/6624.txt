In SharedBuffer.java:

    public int hashCode() {
      return (int) (31 * (timestamp ^ timestamp >>> 32) + 31 * value.hashCode()) + counter;


Multiplier of 31 is applied to both (timestamp ^ timestamp >>> 32) and value.hashCode().
The following is probably the right expression:

      return (int) 31 * (31 * (timestamp ^ timestamp >>> 32) + value.hashCode()) + counter;
