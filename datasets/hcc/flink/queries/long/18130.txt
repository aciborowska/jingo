The sink of different jobs (or the same SQL runs multiple times) will produce the same file name, the rename will fail, and different file systems will produce different results:

	HadoopFileSystem: ignore new data.
	LocalFileSystem: overwrite old data.



We can add UUID to prefix, make sure there is no conflict between jobs.
