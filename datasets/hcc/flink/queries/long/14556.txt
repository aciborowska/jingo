Currently the package structure of cloud pickle is as following:


cloudpickle-1.2.2/
cloudpickle-1.2.2/cloudpickle/
cloudpickle-1.2.2/cloudpickle/__init__.py 
cloudpickle-1.2.2/cloudpickle/cloudpickle.py 
cloudpickle-1.2.2/cloudpickle/cloudpickle_fast.py 
cloudpickle-1.2.2/LICENSE


It should be:


cloudpickle/ 
cloudpickle/__init__.py  
cloudpickle/cloudpickle.py  
cloudpickle/cloudpickle_fast.py  
cloudpickle/LICENSE


Otherwise, the following error will be thrown when running in a standalone cluster :"ImportError: No module named cloudpickle".
