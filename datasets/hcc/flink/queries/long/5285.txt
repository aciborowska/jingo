When using at least once mode (BarrierTracker), then an interleaved arrival of cancellation barriers at the BarrierTracker of two consecutive checkpoints can trigger a flood of CancelCheckpointMarkers. 

The following sequence is problematic:

Cancel(1, 0),
Cancel(2, 0),
Cancel(1, 1),
Cancel(2, 1),
Cancel(1, 2),
Cancel(2, 2)



with Cancel(checkpointId, channelId)
