https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.8/ops/deployment/gce_setup.html links to https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bdutil/blob/master/extensions/flink/flink_env.sh which uses ancient versions of Hadoop and Flink.

Also the barrier to a newcomer is that bdutil itself is deprecated and the readme recommends DataFlow instead.

Furthermore, perhaps it would be wise to include GCP in the built-in filesystems in https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.8/ops/filesystems.html?

Further, https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.8/ops/filesystems.html#hdfs-and-hadoop-file-system-support doesn't actually link to any of the other configuration pages for thees other hadoop-based filesystems, nor does it explain how what exact library needs to be in the flink `lib folder; so it's really hard to go any further from there.

Lastly, it would seem the 1.8.0 release has stopped shipping the Hadoop libs, without documenting the change required, e.g. in the Hadoop File System page linked above.
