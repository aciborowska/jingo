When it comes to the last reuqested container, the container is received and returned over and over again like this:
14:36:19,486 INFO org.apache.flink.yarn.YarnResourceManager - Received new container: container_1535124617388_1936_01_000929 - Remaining pending container requests: 0
14:36:19,486 INFO org.apache.flink.yarn.YarnResourceManager - Returning excess container container_1535124617388_1936_01_000929.
But the truth is that the program still needs a container, it should not be a "excess".

Sometimes it will last several minutes, which is out of our expectations.
