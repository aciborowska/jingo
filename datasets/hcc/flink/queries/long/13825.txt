Previously, the result of Flink distribution build didn't contain plugins dir.
Instead, for some e2e tests, the directory was created (and removed) by a test's setup steps.

FLINK-12868 has added a pre-created plugins dir into the Flink distribution build, but without adjusting the e2e tests. As the result, after some e2e tests run, the original directory is removed.
