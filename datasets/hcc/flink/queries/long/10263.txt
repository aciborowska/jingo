When using a user-defined scalar function only with literal parameters, a CompileException is thrown. For example



SELECT myFunc(CAST(40.750444 AS FLOAT), CAST(-73.993475 AS FLOAT))

public class MyFunc extends ScalarFunction {

	public int eval(float lon, float lat) {
		// do something
	}
}



results in 



[ERROR] Could not execute SQL statement. Reason:
org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: Line 5, Column 10: Cannot determine simple type name "com"



The problem is probably caused by the expression reducer because it disappears if a regular attribute is added to a parameter expression.
