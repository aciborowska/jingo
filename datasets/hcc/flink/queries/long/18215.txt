The BashJavaUtils currently log things like this:


[] - The derived from fraction jvm overhead memory (160.000mb (167772162 bytes)) is less than its min value 192.000mb (201326592 bytes), min value will be used instead



This means that users cannot differentiate between info/warn/error messages.
An example where this might be helpful is FLINK-18214.
