The following test failed on Travis:
TaskTest.testExecutionFailesAfterCanceling:561->validateUnregisterTask:774 TaskManager message is not 'UnregisterTask'

https://travis-ci.org/uce/flink/jobs/72292328

I think it's some flakeyness in the test. It's the first time I saw this failing. From the logs, I couldn't tell what went wrong. In the test there is a timeout for the expected message to arrive. Maybe that's the issue, [~StephanEwen]?
