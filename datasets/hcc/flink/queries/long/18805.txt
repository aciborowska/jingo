When presented with a name containing multiple upper characters in sequence, like "JMXOptions", the generator does not properly convert this sequence, resulting in "j_mx_options".

I'd like to make a small change such that the conversions work like this:
JMXOptions -> jmx_options
RocksDBOptions -> rocksdb_options
