The current implementation of the PageRank algorithm expects a weighted edge list as input. However, if the edge weight is other than 1.0, this will result in wrong results.
We should change the library method and corresponding examples (also GSAPageRank) to expect an unweighted graph and compute the transition probabilities correctly.
