According to https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/832, there is a JDK issue during garbage collection when the SSL session cache is not limited. We should allow the user to configure this and further (advanced) SSL parameters for fine-tuning to fix this and similar issues. In particular, the following parameters should be configurable:

	SSL session cache size
	SSL session timeout
	SSL handshake timeout
	SSL close notify flush timeout
