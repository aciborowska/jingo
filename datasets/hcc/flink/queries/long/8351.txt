I started experimenting with QueryableStateStream by referencing this site which is linked by Flink's website ⇒ https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.4/dev/stream/state/queryable_state.html 

I think the example given is perfectly fine and runs w/o much issue. However, i started extrapolating the situation to have a FoldingState where the application continuously updates the state and another part of the application retrieves the state and i ran into the following situation:


	Is there a canonical way or API that allows the app to extract the submitted job-id in order to query the current state
	
		As a work around, i'm querying the url localhost:8081/jobs but this does not work when there are other jobs running
	
	
	Is there another way to query the state other than polling ? Is it possible to to return the final result as part of the JobExecutionResult
	
		At the moment, the app is polling the url localhost:8081/jobs and using that JobID to query the state but when the job completes, the job's state is not persisted and i lose the final state value
	
	



I realized QueryableStateStream is in beta as of the time of this issue so there are things i might have missed. Any help or tip is greatly appreciated ☺
