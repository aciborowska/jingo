Some statefun modules use hard-coded scala versions (e.g., statefun-flink-core), while others are parameterized (e.g., statefun-flink-harness).

Either we should change this or document why it works the way it does.

Naturally it also begs the questions whether the statefun modules also require scala suffixes.
