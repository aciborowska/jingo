PackagedProgramUtils#createJobGraph(...) is used to generate JobGraph in k8s job mode.
The problem is that the configuration field of StreamExecutionEnvironment is a newly created one when building the job program. This is because StreamPlanEnvironment ctor will base on the no param version ctor of StreamExecutionEnvironment.

This may lead to an unexpected result when invoking StreamExecutionEnvironment#configure(...) which relies on the configuration. Many configurations in the flink conf file will not be respected, like pipeline.time-characteristic, pipeline.operator-chaining, execution.buffer-timeout, and state backend configs.
