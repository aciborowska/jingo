I noticed this while debugging EventTimeWindowCheckpointingITCase. If you change testSlidingWindows() to use a tumbling window instead of the sliding window the test should fail. Interestingly, the tests only fail when using the RocksDB backend but not for the heap-based backends.

You can follow the flow by setting a breakpoint on the AssertionError being thrown in ValidatingSink. Somewhere in the Task innards it will be suppressed/swallowed and the test will succeed.
