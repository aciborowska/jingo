The Quickstart project contains a Maven configuration that builds a fat jar using the Maven Shade plugin. It copies the META-INF folder of the original jar into the fat jar as well. That can lead to a SecurityException when submitting jobs to the cluster because the signature file contained in the original jar is not suitable for the fat jar. 


 java.lang.SecurityException: Invalid signature file digest for Manifest main attributes



The solution is to change the configuration of the Shade plugin to ignore the signature files in the META-INF folder when copying the dependencies to the fat jar.
