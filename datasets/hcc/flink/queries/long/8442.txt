In flip-1, it enable only restart the executions in a FailoverRegion when a task fail. But now the input splits are assigned only when an ExecutionJobVertex is initializing, so when an executions restarts, the input splits it has read may can not be get from job master any more. Need to recover the input splits so they can be be consumed again when the task restarts.
