This is an old issue. Incorrect order of initializeState and open result to initializeState being ignored. For example in this code:


testHarness = createTestHarness(topic);
testHarness.setup();
testHarness.open();
testHarness.initializeState(snapshot1);


Which is miss-leading both for Flink developers and for users (since we recommend using test harness for unit tests).
