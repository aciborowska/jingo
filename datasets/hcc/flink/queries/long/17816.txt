Latency Markers and other periodic timers are scheduled with scheduleAtFixedRate. That means every X time the callable is called. If it blocks (backpressure) is can be called immediately again.

I would suggest to switch this to scheduleAtFixedDelay  to avoid calling for a lot of latency marker injections when there is no way to actually execute the injection call.
