Currently, the python DateType is converted by an `int` which indicates the days passed since 1970-1-1 and then the Java side will create a Java Date by call `new Date(days * 86400)`. As we know that the Date constructor expected milliseconds since 1970-1-1 00:00:00 GMT and so we should convert `days * 86400` to GMTÂ milliseconds.
