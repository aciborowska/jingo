The `TupleUnwrappingGroupReducer` implements an empty `combine()` which means that a `GroupReduceFunction` that is used on a `Grouping` with `KeySelector` cannot use its combiner.

While digging a bit deeper into the code, I am not sure, if a `GroupReduceFunction` will ever use its combiner (even in `Grouping` with field positions and maybe even when applied without a `Grouping`). The `GroupReduceOperatorBase` has a flag attribute `combinable` which seems to be always false, hence telling the optimizer that all `GroupReduceFunction`s do not support `combine()`.

We should check this!
