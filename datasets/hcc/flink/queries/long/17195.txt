Hey, in one of my SourceFunctions, I'm calling ServiceLoader.load(MyDefiniedService.class) which internally fetches the ClassLoader by calling Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader(). It seems like whichever ClassLoader this fetches is unaware of any jars/code that I've shipped.

My application code has not changed and this came up in my attempt switch planners from the old planner to the blink planner. Would appreciate any help I can get on this, thanks.
