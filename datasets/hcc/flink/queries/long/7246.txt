I was running flink 1.2.1, and I have set metrics reporter to JMX to check latency of my job.

But the result is that the latency I observerd is over 100ms even there is no processing in my job.

And then I ran the example SocketWordCount streaming job, and again I saw the latency is over 100ms, I am wondering if there is something misconfiguration or problems.

I was using start-local.bat and flink run to start up the job, all with default configs.

Thank you in advance.
