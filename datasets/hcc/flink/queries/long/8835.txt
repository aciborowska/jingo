Many new config keys in the TaskManager don't follow the proper naming scheme. We need to clear those up before the release. I would also suggest to keep the key names short, because that makes it easier for users.

When doing this cleanup pass over the config keys, I would suggest to also make some of the existing keys more hierarchical harmonize them with the common scheme in Flink.

New Keys


	taskmanager.network.credit-based-flow-control.enabled to taskmanager.network.credit-model.



Existing Keys


	taskmanager.debug.memory.startLogThread => taskmanager.debug.memory.log




	taskmanager.debug.memory.logIntervalMs => taskmanager.debug.memory.log-interval




	taskmanager.initial-registration-pause => taskmanager.registration.initial-backoff




	taskmanager.max-registration-pause => taskmanager.registration.max-backoff




	taskmanager.refused-registration-pause taskmanager.registration.refused-backoff




	taskmanager.maxRegistrationDuration ==> * taskmanager.registration.timeout
