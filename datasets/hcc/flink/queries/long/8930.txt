I'm wring a validation test for FLINK-6924 in org.apache.flink.table.expressions.validation.ScalarFunctionsValidationTest. However, I find that the table api is not truely executed in function "testTableApi", which is different from "testSqlApi". So we can only test exceptions which are thrown in "addTableApiTestExpr" like "ValidationException" because it is thrown during "select" operation.
