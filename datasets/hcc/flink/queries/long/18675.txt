I am running a streaming job with Flink 1.11.0 using kubernetes infrastructure. I have configured checkpoint configuration like below
Interval - 3 minutes
Minimum pause between checkpoints - 3 minutes
Checkpoint timeout - 10 minutes
Checkpointing Mode - Exactly Once
Number of Concurrent Checkpoint - 1
 
Other configs
Time Characteristics - Processing Time
 
I am observing an usual behaviour. When a checkpoint completes successfully and if it's end to end duration is almost equal or greater than Minimum pause duration then the next checkpoint gets triggered immediately without maintaining the Minimum pause duration. Kindly notice this behaviour from checkpoint id 194 onward in the attached screenshot
