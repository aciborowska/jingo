With the lesson learned from FLINK-7266, and the refactor of FLINK-8540, method ofÂ  FileUtils#deletePathIfEmpty has been totally useless in Flink production code. From my point of view, it's not wise to provide a method with already known high-risk defect in Flink official code. I suggest to remove this part of code.
