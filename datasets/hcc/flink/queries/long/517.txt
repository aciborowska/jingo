Not sure if this is by design or by accident, but the Ready to Run Package includes jar files in the examples folder, but no source.

Presumably, the source code for the examples are included in the Stratosphere source (I have not looked at the source), but it will be instructive to include the source code for the examples even in the binaries-only package. 

BTW, I am curious if anyone has tried using the examples source (from the stratosphere-examples module) with just the Stratosphere binaries downloaded? Is it a question of just creating an eclipse project and referencing the jars in the "lib" and "lib_clients" folder?
