Hi,

today I made a couple of scripts and migrated the old dokuwiki to the github wiki:
https://github.com/dimalabs/ozone/wiki

Some issues remain however. We have to:

	find broken links to code that are broken because of the refactoring of Ozone
	resize images when needed



Thus, I would like to ask you to do a pass over the documentation in order to find possible problems and fix them. You can declare here (with a comment) which part of the documentation you would be taking over. 

We will close this issue when this is done. 

cheers,
Asterios
