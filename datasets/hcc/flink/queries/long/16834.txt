Due to removing the dependency flink-clients from flink-streaming-java, the examples can no longer be executed from the IDE. The problem is that the flink-clients dependency is missing.

In order to solve this problem, we need to add the flink-clients dependency to all modules which need it and previously obtained it transitively from flink-streaming-java.
