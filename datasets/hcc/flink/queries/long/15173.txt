i submit a job by command like:

./bin/flink run -m yarn-cluster -yjm 1024m -ytm 1024m -ynm test -yqu c -class com.xxx.SocketWordCount /data/tmp/test.jar

after the job run on yarn, i close the client, and then if the job failed with some problem,the yarn application not exit with failed status, but it still running and the job in the application failed. just like run on a session mode. i check the code , the org.apache.flink.runtime.dispatcher.Dispatcher#shutDownCluster whick call by CliFrontend.

so when i close submit client, the cluster not exit. i think it may be a bug,
