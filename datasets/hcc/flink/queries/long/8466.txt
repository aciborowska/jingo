MemoryArchivist holding on to last thrown exception prevents the user code classloader from being garbage collected.

MemoryArchivist holds on to any number of ArchivedExecutionGraph's. These ArchivedExecutionGraph instances contain a failureCause field of type ErrorInfo that wrap the exception in case one was thrown to terminate the job

This exception class will more often than not have been loaded by a user code classloader, and as long as the MemoryArchivist holds on to this exception, theÂ JVM won't be able to reclaim the resources held by this classloader
