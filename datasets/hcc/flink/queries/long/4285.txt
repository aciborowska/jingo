In https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/quickstart/setup_quickstart.html, the examples/streaming/SocketTextStreamWordCount.jar example doesn't exist anymore in the distributed package.

It was somehow previously removed in https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/986d5368fdb84c44111994b667ce1fc5f9992716. We either add the SocketTextStreamWordCount example back, or change the documentation to use another example, probably SocketWindowWordCount.
