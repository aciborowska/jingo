After FLINK-3909 the unit tests are executed twice. There are now two executions defined for the Surefire plugin: unit-tests and integration-tests. In addition, there is a default execution called default-test. This leads to the unit tests to be executed twice. Either renaming unit-tests to default-test or skipping default-test would fix the problem.
