Recently, we added ProcessFunctionTestHarness for testing ProcessFunction. However, except ProcessFunctionTestHarnessesTest I can not find anything about this test harness in the master codebase.

Considering ProcessFunction is the very important and frenquency-used UDF.

I suggest that we could add a test example in the testing documentation.
