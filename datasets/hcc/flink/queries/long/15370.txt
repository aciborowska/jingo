Currently, we call DBOptions#setWriteBufferManager after we extract the DBOptions from RocksDBResourceContainer, however, we would extract a new DBOptions  when creating the RocksDB instance. In other words, the configured write buffer manager would not take effect in the DBOptions which finally used in target RocksDB instance.
