Table API and SQL aggregates are supposed to ignore null values, e.g., sum(1,2,null,4) is supposed to return 7. 

There current implementation is correct if at least one valid value is present however, is incorrect if only null values are aggregated. sum(null, null, null) should return null instead of 0

Currently only the Count aggregate handles the case of null-values-only correctly.
