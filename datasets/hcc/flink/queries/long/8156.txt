Commons-beanutils v1.8.0 dependency is not security compliant. See CVE-2014-0114:



Apache Commons BeanUtils, as distributed in lib/commons-beanutils-1.8.0.jar in Apache Struts 1.x through 1.3.10 and in other products requiring commons-beanutils through 1.9.2, does not suppress the class property, which allows remote attackers to "manipulate" the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code via the class parameter, as demonstrated by the passing of this parameter to the getClass method of the ActionForm object in Struts 1.



Note that current version commons-beanutils 1.9.2 in turn has a CVE in its dependency commons-collections (CVE-2015-6420, see BEANUTILS-488), which is fixed in 1.9.3.

We should upgrade commons-beanutils from 1.8.3 to 1.9.3
