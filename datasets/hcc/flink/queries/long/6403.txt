In 1.2.0, `config.sh` moved from a shell glob to a find-based approach for constructing the classpath from `/lib` that gets sent to most flink commands, e.g. `start-cluster.sh`. The `find` command does not guarantee an ordering, and we saw issues with flink constructing different classpaths on different machines.

constructFlinkClassPath should be modified to produce a deterministic classpath.
