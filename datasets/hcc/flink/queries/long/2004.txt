Checkpoints that fail never send a commit message to the tasks.

Maintaining a map of all pending checkpoints introduces a memory leak, as entries for failed checkpoints will never be removed.

Approaches to fix this:

	The source cleans up entries from older checkpoints once a checkpoint is committed (simple implementation in a linked hash map)
	The commit message could include the optional state handle (source needs not maintain the map)
	The checkpoint coordinator could send messages for failed checkpoints?
