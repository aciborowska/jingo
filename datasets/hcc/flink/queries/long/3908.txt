If during the parse of a csv there's a parse error (for example when in a integer column there are non-int values) the errorState is not reset correctly in the next parseField call. A simple fix would be to add as a first statement of the parseField() function a call to setErrorState(ParseErrorState.NONE) but it is something that should be handled better (by default) for every subclass of FieldParser<T>
