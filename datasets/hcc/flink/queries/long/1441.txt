In the documentation over here 

http://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute.html it states 
–
To make changes to the website, you have to checkout the source code of it first:

svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/flink/
cd flink
–
when I try this it states.  

hduser@ubuntu:~/Desktop/Flink/website$ svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/flink/
svn: E175011: Repository moved permanently to 'https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/flink'; please relocate

Though there is clear message on what to do I would like to have a first try to change documentation and get to understand the process of contribution.
