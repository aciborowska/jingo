If you create a custom type comparator by subclassing TypeComperator and implement int extractKeys(Object record, Object[] target, int index) and TypeComparator[] getFlatComparators() to return 0 and no type comparators respectively, the coGroup operator (possibly others) find matching elements although no comparators have been specified.

In this case, the expected behavior for a CoGroup would be that only elements from one side are supplied in the CoGroup method.
