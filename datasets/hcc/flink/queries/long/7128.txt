The documentation for the Table API shows the type of a timestamp as TIMESTAMP but it should be SQL_TIMESTAMP.

The following projection fails

.select("myLong.cast(TIMESTAMP)")

 

with the error message "Undefined function: CAST" which is confusing because other cast calls in the same query work correctly. The error message should rather tell the user that the type TIMESTAMP is unknown.
