A query like SELECT 'abc'; fails in sql-client with blink planner enabled with an error:


org.apache.flink.table.api.ValidationException: Type CHAR(3) of table field 'EXPR$0' does not match with the physical type STRING of the 'EXPR$0' field of the TableSink consumed type.



The reason is that those sinks do not properly support new type system. There is no good way to define schema and consumed data type so that they match. We should update the in-memory sinks in sql-client to work with the legacy type system for now until the retract and upsert sinks work properly with the new type system.
