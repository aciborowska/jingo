FLINK-4913 added the user jar into the system classloader, when starting a Flink per job YARN cluster.
Some users were experiencing issues with the changed behavior.

I suggest to introduce a new yarn specific configuration parameter (for the flink-conf.yaml file) to control if the user jar is added into system classloader.
