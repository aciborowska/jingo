Currently, it is not possible to run Flink over network address translation. The problem is that the Flink processes do not allow to specify separate bind and external ports. Moreover, the TaskManager tries to resolve the given taskmanager.host which might not be resolvable. This breaks NAT or docker setups where the external address is not resolvable from within the container/internal network.
