When clicking on the check box next to a job in the WebClient, the client dies if no ExecutionEnvironment is in the main method (probably because it tries to generate the plan).

This can be reproduced easily if a not flink related jar is uploaded.

This is a problem, when your main method only contains code to extract the parameters and then creates the corresponding job class for those parameters.
