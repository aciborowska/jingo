When submitting a new FlinkPlan using the StandaloneClusterClient, the JobManager's REST API appears to hang until the job is submitted. The submission time may be large enough to cause timeouts if the getStatistics and createInputSplits methods of a job's input formats perform time-intensive tasks like running external queries. This is exacerbated when a job contains many such input formats since they appear to be initialized sequentially. For a particular job with over 100 inputs, it's typical for the API (and consequently the web UI) to be non-responsive for 45â€“60 seconds.

Would it make sense for tasks to have a Configuring state before the Created state to provide greater visibility and indicate that the JobManager is still healthy?
