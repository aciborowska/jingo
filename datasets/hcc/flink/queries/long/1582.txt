When the server side of the socket closes the socket stream reader does not terminate. When the socket is reinitiated it does not reconnect just gets stuck.
It would be nice to add options for the user have the reader should behave when the socket is down: terminate immediately (good for testing and examples) or wait a specified time - possibly forever.
