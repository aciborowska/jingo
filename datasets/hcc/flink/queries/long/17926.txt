Currently, the Dockerfile[1] in flink-web project is broken because of the EOL of Ubuntu 18.10[2], will encounter the error such as bellow when executing ./run.sh

The current LTS versions can be found in release website[2].

Apache Flink docker image uses fedora:28[3], so it unaffected.

As fedora does not have LTS release[4], I proposal to use Ubuntu for website here, and change the version from 18.10 to the closest LTS version 18.04, tried locally, it works successfully.
