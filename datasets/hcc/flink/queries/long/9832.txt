As reported on the user mailing list in the thread "Run programs w/ params including comma via REST api" [1], submitting a job with mainArgs that include a comma results in an exception.

To reproduce submit a job with the following mainArgs:


--servers 10.100.98.9:9092,10.100.98.237:9092


The request fails with


Expected only one value [--servers 10.100.98.9:9092, 10.100.98.237:9092].



As a work around, users have to use a different delimiter such as ;.

The proper fix of this API would make these params part of the POST request instead of relying on query params (as noted in FLINK-9499). I think it's still valuable to fix this as part of a bug fix release for 1.5.
