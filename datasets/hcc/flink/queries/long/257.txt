Here is a comprehensive list of all renamings that we want to make before the release. Since renaming will break user code, we should do that once and coordinated, if we do it at all.



	Match -> Join




	Contract -> Operation
	MapContract -> MapOperator
	ReduceContract -> ReduceOperator
	MatchContract -> JoinOperator
	CoGroupContract -> CoGroupOperator
	CrossContract -> CrossOperator




	RecordInputFormat -> CsvInputFormat
	RecordOutputFormat -> CsvOutputFormat




	PlanAssembler -> Job (or StratosphereJob)




	Plan -> remains Plan (no change)
	ScalaPlan -> Plan



The next version of Pact program construction works without a Plan object and will be called "Program"

We also want to reorganize the code project structure (aka the maven dependency structure) to make it simpler for developers and users. As this also breaks programs (in terms of configured dependencies), we want to do this in the same refactoring.
