The TwitterStream does not work with version 1.0.3 because the flink-connector-twitter is missing the following dependencies: org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient and org.apache.httpcomponents:httpcore 

Adding these lines to the pom.xml should fix the problem.


<inlcude>org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient</inlcude>		
<include>org.apache.httpcomponents:httpcore</include>
