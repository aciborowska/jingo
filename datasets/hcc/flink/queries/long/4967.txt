Using the RocksDBStateBackend in Windows leads to the following exception java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.rocksdb.RocksDB which is caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: librocksdbjni-win64.dll was not found inside JAR.
As mentioned here https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/1302, this can be fixed by upgrading rocksDB dependecies, since version 4.9 was the first to include a Windows build of RocksDB.
