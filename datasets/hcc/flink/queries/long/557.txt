currently it seems as if all processes are run by the root user.
For example calling the following command from a normal user account leads to write problems for the logfiles:
```
/usr/share/stratosphere-dist/bin/stratosphere run -j  /usr/share/stratosphere-dist/examples/stratosphere-java-examples-0.5-SNAPSHOT-WordCount.jar -a 16 file:///var/log/syslog file:///home/physikerwelt/out
````
An example how to run services as the designated user can be found at
