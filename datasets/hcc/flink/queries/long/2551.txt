This is a collection of several things that are wrong (or possibly problematic) in the handling of Input/Output formats.

The things I have so far:

	TypeSerializerInputFormat was changed to take a TypeInformation instead of a TypeSerialzer. The javadoc is not updated, however
	This lead to another bug: When the serializer is created from the TypeInformation it is not given the correct ExecutionConfig from the ExecutionEnvironment and thus custom serializers don't work. (This one, I broke)
	In BinaryOutputFormat some fields are not declared transient even though they should be
	The Streaming API does not call setInputType if a format implements InputTypeConfigurable.
