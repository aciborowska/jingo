When running the streaming iteration example with buffer timeout set to 0 (meaning the StreamRecorWriter gets flushed after every emit in every task), the iteration gets stuck at flushing the output after emitting a record. This happens only on larger number of inputs (eg. 1000 record to iterate on).
