The `CancelWithSavepoint` action of the JobManager first stops the checkpoint scheduler, then triggers a savepoint, and cancels the job after the savepoint completes.

If the savepoint fails, the command should not have any side effects and we don't cancel the job. The issue is that the checkpoint scheduler is not restarted though.
