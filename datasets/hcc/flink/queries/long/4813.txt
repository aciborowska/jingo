The flink-test-utils depend on hadoop-minikdc, which has a dependency, which is only resolvable, if the maven-bundle-plugin is loaded.

This is the error message

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project quickstart-1.2-tests: Could not resolve dependencies for project com.dataartisans:quickstart-1.2-tests:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT: Failure to find org.apache.directory.jdbm:apacheds-jdbm1:bundle:2.0.0-M2 in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2 was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced -> [Help 1]



flink-parent loads that plugin, so all "internal" dependencies to the test utils can resolve the plugin.
Right now, users have to use the maven bundle plugin to use our test utils externally.

By making the hadoop minikdc dependency optional, we can probably resolve the issues. Then, only users who want to use the security-related tools in the test utils need to manually add the hadoop minikdc dependency + the plugin.
