Description
Setting yarn.per-job-cluster.include-user-jar: DISABLED in flink-conf.yaml is not supported (anymore). Doing so will lead to the job jar not being on the system classpath, which is mandatory if Flink is deployed in job mode. The job will never run.

Expected behavior
Documentation should reflect that setting yarn.per-job-cluster.include-user-jar: DISABLED does not work.
