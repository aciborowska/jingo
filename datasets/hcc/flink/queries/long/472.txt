I implemented the setTerminationCriterion method for BulkIterations. 

I did my best to rebase my changes to the current version. Unfortunately the current test base is again not Windows compatible, so I was not able to run the tests.

Since the changes are quite complex I would highly appreciate if some of you would test the new termination criterion with some of their currently working iterations. The adjustment to the new criterion should be not too hard.
