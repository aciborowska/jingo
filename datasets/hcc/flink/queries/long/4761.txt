Running the first exercise in the Flink training quickly produces a log file with over 100MB of data. Trying to examine this file in the web frontend blocks the browser.

Suggested (hopefully easy) fix: instead of loading and displaying the whole log file, tail it, and also display a line of summary statistics. 

This is a minor problem if you have access to the shell on the cluster and can tail the file there. Otherwise it could be pretty annoying.
