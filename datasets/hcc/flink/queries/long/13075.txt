As the javadoc of org.apache.flink.table.sources.ProjectableTableSource#projectFields said, the table schema of the TableSource copy must not be modified by this method. However, PushProjectIntoTableSourceScanRule in blink planner requires the returning a table source with the modified table schema. This conflict with the javadoc and result in the TableSource works for flink planner can't work for blink planner.
