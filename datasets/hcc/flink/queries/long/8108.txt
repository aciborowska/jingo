As a simply sanity check the PythonPlanBinder checks the size of the program arguments.

Originally, the minimum argument count was 2; the python version identifier (2 or 3) and the script location.

In FLINK-6229 the python version handling was unified, but the check never adjusted. As a result, scripts that don't take any additional arguments cannot be executed.
