This makes it very hard to fine tune the different processes or to set up profiling on the Task managers.

We should have dedicated config keys for the 3 processes

For example if someone wants to setup jmx for the task manager, and the TM and JM runs on the same host they will try to bind to the same jmx port and fail.
