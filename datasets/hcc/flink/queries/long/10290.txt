`RowTypeInfo#equals()` only compares field types, and fields names are not considered. When checking the equality of `inputType` and `internalType`, we should compare both filed types and field names.

Behavior of this bug:

A table T with schema (a: Long, b:Long, c:Long)
SELECT b,c,a from T
expected: b,c,a
actually: a,b,c
