A user is affected by an issue, which is probably caused by different classloaders being used for loading user classes.

Current state of investigation:

	the error happens in yarn sessions (there is only a YARN environment available)
	the error doesn't happen on the first time the job is being executed. It only happens on subsequent executions.
