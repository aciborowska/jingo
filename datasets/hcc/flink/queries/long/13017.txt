The build tools around docs/docker seem broken and (on my machine) give errors like the following while it is working on a colleague's machine:


bash: /etc/bash_completion.d/git-prompt.sh: No such file or directory
bash: __git_ps1: command not found





/usr/bin/env: 'ruby.ruby2.5': No such file or directory
bash: __git_ps1: command not found



Reason seems to be that your whole user's $HOME is mounted (writable!) into the docker container. We should just mount the docs directory to get

	builds which are independent from the host system (making them reproducible)
	not have the commands in the container affect the host
