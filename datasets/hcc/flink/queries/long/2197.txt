If one uses the the Scala batch and streaming API from within the same program and imports both corresponding package objects, then the Scala API no longer works because it is lacking the implicit TypeInformation values. The reason for this is that both package objects contain an implicit function createTypeInformation. This creates an ambiguity which is not possible for the Scala compiler to resolve.
