The RFC for the CSV format specifies that newlines are valid in quoted strings in CSV:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180

However, when parsing a CSV file with Flink containing a newline, such as:


"3
4",5



you get this exception:


Line could not be parsed: '"3'
ParserError UNTERMINATED_QUOTED_STRING 
Expect field types: class java.lang.String, class java.lang.String
