The release guide contains a dedicated section to Create a release branch.

Yet, the first step in the Build a release candidate is to create another release branch.


Now, create a release branch:

$ cd tools
tools $ OLD_VERSION=$CURRENT_SNAPSHOT_VERSION NEW_VERSION=$RELEASE_VERSION RELEASE_CANDIDATE=$RC_NUM releasing/create_release_branch.sh



We should use different terms, as the first is about snapshot-release-branches (like release-1.5), the latter about the branches actually used for a specific release (like release-1.5.0-rc1).
