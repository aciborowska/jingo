The Kubernetes deployment usesÂ `kubernetes.taskmanager.cpu` for configuring TM cpu cores, and will fallback to number-of-slots if not specified.

FLINK-14188 introduced a common option `taskmanager.cpu.cores` (ATM not exposed to users and for internal usage only). A common logic is to decide the TM cpu cores following the fallback order of "common option -> K8s/Yarn/Mesos specific option -> numberOfSlot".

The above fallback rules are not respected by the Kubernetes deployment.
