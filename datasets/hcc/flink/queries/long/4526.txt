GetClusterStatus and ShutdownClusterAfterJob don't have to be proxied through the ApplicationClient's messages LocalGetyarnClusterStatus and LocalStopAMAfterJob. These messages can be directly handled by the client. The implementations are also faulty in the sense that they don't reply to the client in case the leader is not available.
