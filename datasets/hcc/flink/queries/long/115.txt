Hi,

I changed "News" to "Blog", since I'm planning to write some posts with @uce.
Fabian requested to add another publication.
I also updated the google analytics code to the newest (official) version and used a different tracking id.

For some reason, the stratosphere.eu website is currently out of sync with the github repo! The Stratosphere-Event is missing!

I want approval from @ktzoumas on this before I publish it!
