The CheckpointCoordinator seems to have maps to track KeyValue states independently from other state.

However, currently all state is transferred via a single StateHandle. The CheckpointCoordinator does not populate the key/value state map ever, nor do the deploy fields actually pick up any contents from that map.

This is currently quite confusing and probably error prone.
