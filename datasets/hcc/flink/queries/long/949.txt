While debugging a problem with Robert Metzger, we noticded that exception in the constructor of the ChannelManager are not properly forwarded to the TaskManager.

The concrete problem was the following: num network buffers was misconfigured and tried to allocate more memory than available on the machine. The respective exception was hiden in the stdout file instead of the log.
