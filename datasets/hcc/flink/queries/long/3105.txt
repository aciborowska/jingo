Starting a YARN session with `bin/yarn-session.sh` creates a properties file, which is used to parse job manager information when submitting jobs.

This properties file is also used when submitting a job with bin/flink run -m yarn-cluster. The yarn-cluster mode should actually start a new YARN session.
