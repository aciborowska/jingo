The AbstractOperatorRestoreTestBase can deadlock in case of a failing test case. The problem is that if one test fails then the corresponding test job won't be canceled. Due to that a succeeding test case might not get enough slots to execute because the job of the failing test is still running. This leads to a deadlocked test as happened here: https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/548181384/log.txt

A side effect is that the original test failure won't be properly displayed.
