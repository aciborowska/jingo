Currently the ExecutionGraph.scheduleOrUpdateConsumers can fail the whole ExecutionGraph if it cannot find the corresponding Execution. This situation can occur in the restarting scenario where we have a late callback trying to update its consumers. In this case, the call should forward the exception back to the caller and not fail the ExecutionGraph.
