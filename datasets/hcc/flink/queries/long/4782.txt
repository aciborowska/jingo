This makes it more difficult to use dropwizard metrics with e.g. logback

It's because they are declared in parent pom as compile scope dependencies. 
I don't clearly understand why is it this way - I'd rather have them provided (as they are still specified in dist) but maybe there are some good reasons for that?
