The flink-parent:1.6.1 artifact can't be found on maven central:

Stacktrace from maven


...
Caused by: org.eclipse.aether.transfer.ArtifactNotFoundException: Could not find artifact org.apache.flink:flink-parent:pom:1.6.1 in central (https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2)
...


 

Also when browsing the repository in the browser (https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/flink/flink-parent/1.6.1/) it will show the flink-parent artifact in the list, but return 404 when trying to download it. This does only seem to happen from some networks, as I was able to successfully run the following on a server that I ssh'd into, but not on my local device


curl https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/flink/flink-parent/1.6.1/flink-parent-1.6.1.pom


The artifact can't be found locally, where repo.maven.apache.org resolves to


> host repo.maven.apache.org
repo.maven.apache.org is an alias for repo.apache.maven.org.
repo.apache.maven.org is an alias for maven.map.fastly.net.
maven.map.fastly.net has address 151.101.112.215



On my server repo.maven.apache.org resolves to 151.101.132.215 where the artifact is present.
