Working on a job to dynamically create counters for a keyed stream using counter value state and FileSystem State Backend. It was observed that the counters are stuck after a few records which is most probably because of the counter value state not getting updated.Â 

FS State backend was used because the counter value state was not getting updated from the first record itself when using RocksDBS State Backend.
