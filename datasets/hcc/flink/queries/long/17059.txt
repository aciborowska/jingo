The uploaded pom for flink-shaded-hadoop-2-uber:2.8.3-10.0 has invalid pom 
has a variable in the artefact version field.

That version is being populated from the parent pom where hadoop.version=2.4.1

This means the then internal model for this pom when it's loaded says its v 2.4.1 but the external file version says 2.8.3

This means that when Gradle loads the artefact it barfs about bad metadata and refuses the artefact.

Can't use this series of jars in gradle - except for the actual 2.4.1 instance.

Easy to reproduce - just create a gradle dependency on the 2.8.3 variant.

I guess this situation might be on in mvn??
Suggest a test is added that attempts to consume these artefacts in other common build tools.
