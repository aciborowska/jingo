Inside CliFrontend#disposeSavepoint(), user JAR files are being uploaded to the BlobServer but they are actually not used (also also not cleaned up) in the job manager's handling of the DisposeSavepoint message.

Since removing new savepoints is as simple as deleting files and old savepoints have always worked without these user JARs, we should remove the upload to be able to make the JAR file upload jobId-dependent for FLINK-6916.
