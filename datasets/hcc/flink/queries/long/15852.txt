Steps to reproduce the problem:

	Deploy a YARN session cluster by command ./bin/yarn-session.sh -d
	Deploy a Kubernetes session cluster by command ./bin/kubernetes-session.sh -Dkubernetes.cluster-id=test ...
	Try to submit a Job to the Kubernetes session cluster by command ./bin/flink run -d -e kubernetes-session -Dkubernetes.cluster-id=test examples/streaming/WordCount.jar



It's expected that the Job will be submitted to the Kubernetes session cluster whose cluster-id is test, however, the job was submitted to the YARN session cluster.
