Setup: Kerberos security using keytabs, Flink session on YARN deployment (in standalone, it works fine without problems).

Iâ€™m getting these error messages in the YARN node managers, causing the TaskManager containers to fail to start properly:
org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation: PriviledgedActionException as:tzulitai (auth:SIMPLE) cause:org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: Client cannot authenticate via:[TOKEN, KERBEROS]

The security configuration for Hadoop has been set to "kerberos", to the "auto: SIMPLE" seems very strange. It also seems as if credential tokens has not been properly set for the ContainerLaunchContext s, which may be an issue causing this.
