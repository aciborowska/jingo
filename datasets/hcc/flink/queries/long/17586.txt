Currently the Python dependency management command line options does not work because of such changes on flink-table module:

	The "BatchTableEnvImpl" creates the job pipeline with an empty cached file list, the cached files registered in the "BatchTableEnvImpl.execEnv" are dropped.
	The "StreamPlanner" wraps the real "StreamExecutionEnvironment" into a "DummyStreamExecutionEnvironment", and the getConfiguration() method in the "DummyStreamExecutionEnvironment" is not delegated to the real "StreamExecutionEnvironment". It always returns an empty configuration object.
