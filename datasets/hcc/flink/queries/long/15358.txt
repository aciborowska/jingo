Hello, 

I have to config influx metrics reporter in conf/flink-conf.yaml ,however the password contains a # sign, then the flink will skip the rest part of the password after #, eg:

     metrics.reporter.influxdb.password: xxpasssxx#blabla
  
 #blabla is parsed as an  end line comment.

Can you guys fix it?
