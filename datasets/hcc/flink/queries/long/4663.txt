Flink JDBCOutputFormat logs wrong WARN message as 
"Column SQL types array doesn't match arity of passed Row! Check the passed array..."
even if there is no mismatch is SQL types array & arity of passed Row.

 (flink/flink-batch-connectors/flink-jdbc/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/api/java/io/jdbc/JDBCOutputFormat.java)

It logs lot of unnecessary warning messages (one per row passed) in log files.
