I've had a look at our connectors and our shading practices very inconsistent. Connectors either:

	don't shade anything at all
	shade dependencies that are prone to causing conflicts (like guava)
	shade everything



Examples:

	nifi, hbase, jdbc, orc, ES6, rabbitmq, Kafka
	Cassandra, Kinesis
	ES1,2,5, twitter
