The KMeans Scala and Java examples differ in the expected input format - the Scala program expects `(pointID, x, y, z)` as input whereas the Java program expects `(x, y)`, which is the format generated by the `KMeansDataGenerator`.

Consequently, the Quick Start seems to work only with the Java example.
