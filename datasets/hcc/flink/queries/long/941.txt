If I increase my data set, my algorithm stops at some point and doesn't continue anymore. I already waited a quite amount of time, but nothing happens. The linux processor explorer also displays that the process is sleeping and waiting for something to happen, could maybe be a deadlock.

I attached the source of my program, the class HAC_2 is the actual algorithm.
Changing the line 271 from "if(Integer.parseInt(tokens[0]) > 282)" to "if(Integer.parseInt(tokens[0]) > 283)" at my PC "enables" the bug. The numbers 282, 283 are the numbers of the documents in my test data and this line skips all documents with an id greater than that.
