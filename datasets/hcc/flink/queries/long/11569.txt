Seems like the "toString" method for Row type is only concatenating all fields using COMMA ",". However it does not wrap the entire Row in some type of encapsulation, for example "()". This results in nested Row being serialized as if they are all in one level.

For example:


Row.of("a", 1, Row.of("b", 2))


is printed out as


"a",1,"b",2


Problematic piece of code can be found here: https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/types/Row.java#L87

New changes should be simple to have a dedicated wrapper for the "row" stringify format, something like:


("a",1,("b",2))
