When generating config option docs with the command suggested by flink-docs/README.md, the generated docs/_includes/generated/python_configuration.html does not contain any config options despite that there are 4 options in PythonOptions. 

I encountered this problem at the commit 545534e43ed37f518fe59b6ddd8ed56ae82a234b on master branch.

Command used to generate doc:

mvn package -Dgenerate-config-docs -pl flink-docs -am -nsu -DskipTests
