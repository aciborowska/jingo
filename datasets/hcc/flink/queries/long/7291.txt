The implementation of getArity() in ListTypeInfo and MapTypeInfo returns 0 but should return 1.

The implementation of MapTypeInfo.getTotalFields() is also incorrect and must return 1 instead of 2.

The JavaDocs of TypeInformation.getArity() and TypeInformation.getTotalFields() should be extended as well to avoid future confusion about this method. The method returns the arity for current type. For atomic types, this is 1 for composite types, the number of non-nested fields (or number of fields on the first nesting-level).
