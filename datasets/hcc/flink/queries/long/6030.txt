Some job metrics are not updated regularly. They are:

	lastCheckpointSize
	lastCheckpointDuration
	lastCheckpointAlignmentBuffered
	lastCheckpointExternalPath



All of them are exposed by the CheckpointStatsTracker class.
The metrics remain exactly the same for long periods of time and only change after triggering a savepoint or after a job recovery.
