Currently we throw an exception in YarnClusterDescriptor#startAppMaster if we first detect FINISHED before RUNNING. However, it is possible a legal state that the application finished normally immediately.

Right now we always try to connect the Dispatcher so it may be fine to throw the exception a bit earlier(otherwise when connect to a closed cluster an exception thrown also), but it is semantically wrong. Internally we have a code path that only required to report the ApplicationReport and it causes trouble.
