I have set "execution.checkpointing.interval" to "5s" and "sink.rolling-policy.time-interval" to "2s". However, it still take 60 seconds to see the first part file. 

This can be reproduced by the following code in SQL CLI:



CREATE TABLE CsvTable (
  event_timestamp STRING,
  `user` STRING,
  message STRING,
  duplicate_count BIGINT,
  constant STRING
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'filesystem',
  'path' = '$RESULT',
  'format' = 'csv',
  'sink.rolling-policy.time-interval' = '2s'
);

INSERT INTO CsvTable -- read from Kafka Avro, and write into Filesystem Csv
SELECT AvroTable.*, RegReplace('Test constant folding.', 'Test', 'Success') AS constant
FROM AvroTable;



This is found when I migrate SQLClientKafkaITCase to use DDL (FLINK-18086).
