In the documentation: https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.10/dev/table/sql/queries.html#scan-projection-and-filter

There is an example:



SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE a % 2 = 0



But % operator is not allowed in Flink:




org.apache.calcite.sql.parser.SqlParseException: Percent remainder '%' is not allowed under the current SQL conformance level



Either we correct the documentation to use MOD function, or allow % operator.
