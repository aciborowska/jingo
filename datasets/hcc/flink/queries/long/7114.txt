For example, Like in HadoopFileSystem  class, there is a field which is written like private static final String DEFAULT_HDFS_CLASS = "org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DistributedFileSystem";. This way of writing has a bad stuff, once the classpath changes, it is difficult to find the error. I suggest we should change it to a more flexable way.
