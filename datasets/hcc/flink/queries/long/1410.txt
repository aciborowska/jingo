The new website layout doesn't use the variables in the website configuration.
This makes releasing versions extremely hard, because one needs to manually fix all the links for every version change.

The old layout of the website was respecting all variables which made releasing a new version of the website a matter of minutes (changing one file).
I would highly recommend to fix FLINK-1387 first.
