The dynamically-linked wrapper library in flink-shaded-netty-tcnative-dynamic may not work on all systems, depending on how the system-provided openSSL library is built.
As a result, when trying to run Flink with security.ssl.provider: OPENSSL or just running a test based on SSLUtilsTest (which checks for openSSL availability which is enough to trigger the error below), the JVM will crash, e.g. with

	on SUSE-based systems:


/usr/lib64/jvm/java-openjdk/bin/java: relocation error: /tmp/liborg_apache_flink_shaded_netty4_netty_tcnative_linux_x86_644115489043239307863.so: symbol TLSv1_2_server_method version OPENSSL_1.0.1 not defined in file libssl.so.1.0.0 with link time reference


	on Arch Linux:


/usr/lib/jvm/default/bin/java: relocation error: /tmp/liborg_apache_flink_shaded_netty4_netty_tcnative_linux_x86_648476498532937980008.so: symbol SSLv3_method version OPENSSL_1.0.0 not defined in file libssl.so.1.0.0 with link time reference





Possible solutions:

	build your own OS-dependent dynamically-linked netty-tcnative library and shade it in your own build of flink-shaded-netty-tcnative-dynamic, or
	use flink-shaded-netty-tcnative-static:


git clone https://github.com/apache/flink-shaded.git
cd flink-shaded
mvn clean package -Pinclude-netty-tcnative-static -pl flink-shaded-netty-tcnative-static


	get your OS-dependent build into netty-tcnative as a special branch similar to what they currently do with Fedora-based systems
