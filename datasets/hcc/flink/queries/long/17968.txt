This pull request mentions an issue with the serialization of the Configuration field in HBaseRowInputFormat: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/12146.
After reviewing the code, it seems that this field is transient, thus it is always null at runtime.

Note HBaseRowDataInputFormat is likely suffering from the same issue (because the code has been copied)
