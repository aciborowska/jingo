There seem to be frequent issues with Travis hanging in tests, even if these tests are singlethreaded and without I/O operations.

For example this test
```
https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/12730622/log.txt
```
hung in the PactrecordITCase, which is a CPU intensive test that takes a while (normally some 10-20 seconds), but is single threaded and isolated.

It seems that the Travis VMs frequently freeze more or less, causing tests to take very long (longer than the threshold) and to get marked as erroneous. The build is then marked as failed, even though all tests cases are actually working.
