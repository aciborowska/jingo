The example code in this doc page doesn't compile:

https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/libs/state_processor_api.html

Here are two instances I found:

	Reading State java and scala contain references to undefined stateDescriptor variable
	Reading Keyed State scala has some invalid scala ("override def open(Configuration parameters)")
