The WebRuntimeMonitor checks that in the given log directory only a single file following the pattern .jobmanager[^\.]\.log is present. If this is not the case, then the WebRuntimeMonitor will fail to start. This is a problem if you have multiple JobManager started which all log to the same directory as in the HA case, for example.
