``TupleComparator`` causes inverted sort order, i.e., DESCENDING instead of ASCENDING (and vice versa).

To reproduce emit the key invocation order of a Reduce function with an Integer as key (should be ascending by default but is descending). 
Might be a problem related to inverted normalized keys (similar to the bug fixed in db68dd8).
