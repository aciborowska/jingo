The PythonStreamer opens a new process calling the python binary to check whether the binary is available. This process won't get closed leading to an excessive number of open python processes when running the PythonPlanBinderTest. I'm not entirely sure whether we need this extra process, because the actual python call with the python code would also fail if there is no python binary available.
