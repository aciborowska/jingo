WebRuntimeMonitor verifies the log and stdout directory by checking that files matching the patterns 

.*jobmanager[^\\.]*\\.log

 and 

.*jobmanager[^\\.]*\\.out

 were created. The filenames use the system hostname which can contain periods, which are excluded by the file pattern and prevent the web monitor from starting.
