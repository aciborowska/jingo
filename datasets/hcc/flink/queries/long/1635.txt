I've added Thrift and Protobuf to Flink to support it out of the box with Kryo.

However, after trying to access a HCatalog/Hive table yesterday using Flink I found that there is a dependency conflict between Flink and Hive (on thrift).

Maybe it makes more sense to properly document our serialization framework and provide a "copy&paste" solution on how to get thrift/protobuf et al to work with Flink.

Please chime in if you are against removing the "out of the box support" for protobuf and kryo.
