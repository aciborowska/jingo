I use the flink version of 1.2.0. I deploy the Flink cluster on the yarn. I have three nodes. Every node has 32GB memory and 16 slots. And the flink
key configuration is :yarn.containers.vcores: 16.
I use two yarn deployment models, but the result is not same.The details are the following:
1、First  I use the flink yarn session model:
1) I start the flink yarn cluster with the command:./yarn-session.sh -n 2 -s 1 -d . 
2)Then I submit a streaming job with the command :  ./flink run -p 3 ../examples/streaming/WindowJoin.jar ;
3) the streaming job deploy failure. The reason is:"Not enough free slots available to run the job. You can decrease the operator parallelism or increase the number of slots per TaskManager in the configuration."
2、The I use the yarn cluster model:
1) I start the yarn cluster and submit a streaming job with command " ./flink run -m yarn-cluster -yn 2 -ys 1 -p 3 ../examples/streaming/WindowJoin.jar "
but, the streaming job is runing;
2) I look at the code, if there is a -p parameter in the command, the -ys parameter is not take effect.

what is the design for -ys parameter?  I think the result of yarn session is reasonable, the yarn cluster is not reasonable. How do you think?
