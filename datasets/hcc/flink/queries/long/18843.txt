Flink web-ui use Tabs provided by ant-design implements navigations. I found an ISSUE of Tabs saying that the height of Tabs are configured as 100% by default.

It results in the content of current Tab can't be viewed.

I fixed it in our project by rewrite the style of class ant-tabs-nav and ant-tabs-tab like following in rewrite.less, it looks like work.


// code placeholder
.ant-tabs-nav .ant-tabs-tab{
  height: auto;
}
