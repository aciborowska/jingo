There are some dependencies for which two different versions end up in the lib folder

```
servlet-api-2.5-6.1.14.jar
servlet-api-3.0.20100224.jar
stax-api-1.0.1.jar
stax-api-1.0-2.jar
```
As far as I see it, these are transitive dependencies.

Teh problem is that what classes are available at runtime depends on which jar is loaded first by the classloader. This is somewhat unpredictable and can lead to weird errors in the components that have these dependencies.
