This is a fix for issue: (#791 | FLINK-791) 

If the standard delimiter is \n, a \r\n is accepted as well. Therefore a
marker was introduced to indicate that specific case. The delimiter
length is variably set to the windows delimiter size then. To prevent
failing in reading input with windows line endings.
The DelimitedInputFormat.open() method did not check if it has parsers
registered. Added throwing an exception when no parser is registered
when calling open. CsvInputFormat does now accept windows line endings
with standards settings. The |\r\n" will be replaced by "\n_"( _ is a
space)... To prevent from errors the returned length is set to the
space. So that this byte is known as parsed and will not get interpreted
anymore.
