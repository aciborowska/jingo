The YARNSessionCapacitySchedulerITCase spuriously fails on Travis because it now contains 2017-11-25 22:49:49,204 WARN  akka.remote.transport.netty.NettyTransport                    - Remote connection to [null] failed with java.nio.channels.NotYetConnectedException from time to time in the logs. I suspect that this is due to switching from Flakka to Akka 2.4.0. In order to solve this problem I propose to add this log statement to the whitelisted log statements.
