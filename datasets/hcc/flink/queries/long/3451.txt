During start up, the NettyServer port is configured via NetUtils.getAvailablePort(). In most cases, this works as expected, but it is possible that another service grabs the port while it is available (between the check and NettyServer initialization).

It is more robust to let NettyServer pick the port itself no port is specified.

In general the getAvailablePort-then-setConfig pattern is not recommended.
