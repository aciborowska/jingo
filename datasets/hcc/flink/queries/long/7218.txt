This 's a subtask of FLINK-7153.

The ExecutionVertex.getPreferredLocationsBasedOnInputs will always return empty, cause `sourceSlot` always be null until `ExectionVertex` has been deployed via 'Execution.deployToSlot()'. So allocate resource base on prefered location can't work correctly, we need to set the slot info for `Execution` as soon as Execution.allocateSlotForExecution() called successfully.
