In looking at https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.4/dev/stream/operators/windows.html#processwindowfunction-with-incremental-aggregation, I noticed a few errors...

	"This allows to incrementally compute windows" should be "This allows it to incrementally compute windows"
	DataStream<Tuple2<String, Long> input = ...; should be DataStream<Tuple2<String, Long>> input = ...;
	The getResult() method needs to cast one of the accumulator values to a double, if that's what it is going to return.
	MyProcessWindowFunction needs to extend, not implement ProcessWindowFunction
	MyProcessWindowFunction needs to implement a process() method, not an apply() method.
	The call to .timeWindow takes a Time parameter, not a window assigner.
