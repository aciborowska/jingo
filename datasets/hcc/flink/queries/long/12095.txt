British and American English is mixed in some places, leading to confusion between "canceled" and "cancelled", and "canceling" and "cancelling".

It is called "canceling" in the ExecutionState enum: https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/8ed85fe49b7595546a8f968e0faa1fa7d4da47ec/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/execution/ExecutionState.java

But for example here, it is incorrectly called "cancelling": https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/internals/job_scheduling.html

Likewise in the state diagram of the ExecutionState itself: https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/8ed85fe49b7595546a8f968e0faa1fa7d4da47ec/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/execution/ExecutionState.java#L31

Same for the /jobs REST schema. It is unclear if this is due to incorrect documentation or a misspelling in the JSON output i.e. if the schema is wrong or correct, but misspelled.
