Steps to reproduce:

	Get Flink 1.4 (f5a0b4bdfb)
	Get ZK (3.3.6 in this case)
	Put the following flink-conf.yaml:


high-availability: zookeeper
high-availability.storageDir: file:///tmp/flink-ha
high-availability.zookeeper.quorum: localhost:2181
high-availability.zookeeper.path.cluster-id: /my-namespace






	Start Flink, submit a job (any streaming example will do)



The job submission will time out. On the JobManager, it seems that the job submission gets stuck when trying to submit something to Zookeeper.

In the JM UI, the job will sit there in status "CREATED"
