The following test cases of YarnClusterDescriptorTest have failed to validate the original intended behavior and are temporally skipped by PR#10834.
 - testFailIfTaskSlotsHigherThanMaxVcores
 - testConfigOverwrite

The original purpose of these two test cases was to verify the validation logic against yarn max allocation vcores (in 5836f7eddb4849b95d4860cf20045bc61d061918).

These two cases should have failed when we change the validation logic to get yarn max allocation vcores from yarnClient instead of configuration (in e959e6d0cd42f0c5b21c0f03ce547f2025ac58d5), because there are no yarn cluster (neither MiniYARNCluster) started in these cases, thus yarnClient#getNodeReports will never return.

The cases have not failed because another IllegalConfigurationException was thrown in validateClusterSpecification, because of memory validation failure. The memory validation failure was by design, and in order to verify the original purpose these two test cases should have been updated with reasonable memory sizes, which is unfortunately overlooked. 

The problem could be fixed with the following changes:

	Update the memory setups for the test cases, to pass the memory validation and thus validate the original intended behavior.
	Extract the logic of getting yarn max allocation vcores into a separate method, and override it in the test cases to provide a constant max vcores.
