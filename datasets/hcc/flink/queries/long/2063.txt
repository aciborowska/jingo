Currently, the streaming checkpoint coordinator is configured only with the list of input and output vertices as stateful vertices.

Checkpoint confirmations from intermediate vertices are ignored.

Since the runtime assumes that all vertices participate in checkpointing anyways (all of them send acknowledge messages), the coordinator should be configured accordingly.
