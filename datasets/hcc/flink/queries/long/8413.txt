We have a project which consumes events from kafka,does a groupby in a time window(5 mins),after window elapses it pushes the events to downstream for merge.This project is deployed using flink ,we have enabled checkpointing to recover from failed state.

(windowsize: 5mins , checkpointingInterval: 5mins,state.backend: filesystem)

Offsets from kafka  get checkpointed every 5 mins(checkpointingInterval).Before finishing the entire DAG(groupBy and merge) , events offsets are getting checkpointed.So incase of any restart from task-manager ,new task gets started from last successful checkpoint ,but we could'nt able to get the aggregated snapshot data(data from groupBy task) from the persisted checkpoint.

Able to retrieve the last successful checkpointed offset from kafka ,but couldnt able to get last aggregated data till checkpointing.
