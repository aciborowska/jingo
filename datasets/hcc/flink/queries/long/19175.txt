The tests in JoinITCase claim to test the BroadcastHashJoin, but they actually do not. None of the tables used in the tests have proper statistics therefore, none of the tables meet the threshold for the broadcast join. At the same time the ShuffleHashJoin is not disabled, therefore they silently fallback to ShuffleHashJoin.

In summary none (or at least not all of the tests) are executed for BroadcastHashJoin, but are executed twice for ShuffleHashJoin.
