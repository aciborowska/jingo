The downloads pages says


Apache Flink® 1.2.0 is our latest stable release.

You don’t have to install Hadoop to use Flink, but if you plan to use Flink with data stored in Hadoop, pick the version matching your installed Hadoop version. If you don’t want to do this, pick the Hadoop 1 version.

But Hadoop 1 appears to no longer be an available alternative.
