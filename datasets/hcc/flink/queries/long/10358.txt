When extending the flink kinesis connector to consume from a dynamodb stream, it was found NPE could be thrown at here . 

This is because the getRecords API in dynamodb streams does not return the millisBehindLatest field and has it set to null.  Null check is probably needed here.

See FLINK-4582 for the context of building dynamodb streams connector on top of the Kinesis connector.
