Now when RestServerEndpoint.getRestAddress, it will return an address same with the value of config rest.address, the default it 127.0.0.1:9067, but this address can not be accessed from another machine. And the ip for Dispatcher and JobMaster are usually dynamically, so user will configure it to 0.0.0.0, and the getRestAddress will return 0.0.0.0:9067, this address will be registered to YARN or Mesos, but this address can not be accessed from another machine also. So it need to return the real ip:port for user to access the web monitor anywhere.
