The BlobStore (BlobCache + BlobServer) does not delete the blob store directory if it is not properly shutdown. This happens if one kills the process as it is done by Flink's start and stop shell scripts.

We can solve the problem by registering a shutdown hook to do the cleanup. The shutdown hook has to delete a unique directory which has been created by the blob store.
