When a TaskManager is lost, the job reports as the failure cause


org.apache.flink.util.FlinkException: The assigned slot 6d0e469d55a2630871f43ad0f89c786c_0 was removed.



That is a pretty bad error message, as a user I don't know what that means. Sounds like it could simply refer to internal book keeping, maybe some rebalancing or so.
You need to know a lot about Flink to understand that this means actually "TaskManager failure".
