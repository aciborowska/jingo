In the documentation for metrics in the Flink 1.5.0 release, it says that the following metrics are reported by the JobManager:

numRegisteredTaskManagers
numRunningJobs
taskSlotsAvailable
taskSlotsTotal



In the job manager REST endpoint (http://<job-manager>:8081/jobmanager/metrics), those metrics don't appear.
