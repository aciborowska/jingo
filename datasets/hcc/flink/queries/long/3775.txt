The Flink Scala shell does not load Flink's configuration properly. This makes it impossible to connect to a remote HA cluster, for example. The reason is that the GlobalConfiguration is never properly loaded. I think the Scala shell should respect the Flink settings specified in flink-conf.yaml if available.
