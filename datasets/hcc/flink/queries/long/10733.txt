In the `common.sh` base script of the end-to-end tests, there is a `clean_stdout_files` which cleans only the `.out` files and a `clean_log_files` which cleans *both `.log` and `.out` files.

Given the current behavior that at the end of a test, the logs are checked and if there are exceptions (even expected ones but not whitelisted), the tests fails, some tests chose to call the `clean_log_files` so that exceptions are ignored. In this case, also `*.out` files are cleaned so if a test was checking for errors in the `.out` files, then the test will falsely pass.

The solution is as simple as renaming the method to something more descriptive like `clean_logs_and_output_files`, but doing so, also includes checking if any existing tests were falsely passing.
