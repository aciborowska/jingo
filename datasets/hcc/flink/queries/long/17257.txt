In AbstractYarnClusterTest, we create ApplicationReport with the static method ApplicationReport.newInstance, which is annotated as private and unstable. This method is no longer compatible in Hadoop 2.10.

As a workaround, we can create ApplicationReport with its default constructor and set only the fields that we need.
