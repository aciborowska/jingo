From https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-18137?focusedCommentId=17133144&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17133144:

There are several cases when masterStateCompletableFuture can be left incomplete:

	checkpoint is discarded (aborted) - line 690 throws an exception instead of completing the future
	checkpoint is discarded (aborted) - line 696 doesn't complete the future even if everything is acked (what  has Till Rohrmann found)
	CompletableFuture.allOf waits for both masterStates and coordinatorCheckpoints futures while it could "return" as soon as one fails



Need to check first.
