Currently, the `Grouping` class (used for grouped reduce, reduceGroup, aggregate, coGroup) has the option to specify a group order. Half of the operators need to throw an exception when encountering it because they do not support group order.

I would suggest to move this either to the operators that support group order (`reduceGroup`, `coGroup`) or to a subclass of `Grouping` that is created for these operators.
