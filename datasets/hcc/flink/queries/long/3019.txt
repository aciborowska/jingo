While reproducing FLINK-3011 locally, I run bin/flink list and get no running/scheduled jobs although the job is displayed on the web interface (with job status RESTARTING).

A job that fails repeatedly to be re-deployed (like FLINK-3011), is not shown and can not be easily cancelled if there is no log access/running web interface to gather the job ID.

Furthermore, the log shows this output for me:


Successfully retrieved list of jobs
NULNULNULNULNULNUL...NUL (NUL denotes the NUL character)

 

I would display all jobs which have been returned to the client with their status. This will then have the same behaviour as the web interface.
