We currently do not ship `spargel` with the stratosphere downloadable binary.
The spargel out-of-the-box experience is bad since the quickstart does not use `jar-with-dependencies` as the default packaging method (for some good reasons). But, users can not simply add `spargel` as a dependency to their project and run it on a cluster.

I suggest to include this PR to the 0.4.1 release https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/issues/395
