Failing/restarting jobs are not handled very cleanely by the webfrontend. There are multiple issues:


	One cannot cancel a restarting job (there is no cancel button): this is a problem if its a nonrecoverable failure and you just want to kill it
	Sometimes restarting but manually canceled jobs stay in the running jobs section in restarting phase even though it has been canceled.
