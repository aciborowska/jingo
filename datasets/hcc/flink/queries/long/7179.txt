In the implementation of window of stream sql, BoundedOutOfOrdernessTimestampExtractor is designed to extract row time from each row. It assumes the ts field is in the data stream by default. On the other hand, ProjectableTableSource is designed to help projection push down. If there is no row time related field in a query, the extractor can't function well.
