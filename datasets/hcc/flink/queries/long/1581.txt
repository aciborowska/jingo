We are using Akka's DeathWath mechanism to detect failed components. However, the interval until an Instance is marked dead is currently very long. Especially, in conjunction with the job restarting mechanism we should devise a mechanism which either quickly detects dead Instance}}s or  set the interval, pause and threshold values such that the detection does not take longer than the Akka ask timeout value. Otherwise, all retries might be consumed before an {{Instance is recognized being dead.

Further investigation of the correct failure behavior is necessary.
