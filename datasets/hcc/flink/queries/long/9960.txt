When Hadoop/HDFS is running in HA mode, there may be more than one namenode running: One active and another standby.

If, for whatever reasons, the server configured in high-availability.storageDir is currently in standby mode (e.g., Hadoop failed over the other namenode), the JobManager will refuse to start because it can't contact hdfs â€“ in this case, it should have a list of servers (up to 2) and, in case of a failure to connect, go to the next one.
