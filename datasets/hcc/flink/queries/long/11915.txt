The flink-core:org.apache.flink.api.java.typeutils.runtime.DataInputViewStream overrides the InputSteam skip function. This function should be returning the actual number of bytes skipped, but there is a bug which makes it return a lower value.

The fix should be something simple like:


-  return n - counter - inputView.skipBytes((int) counter);
+  return n - (counter - inputView.skipBytes((int) counter));


For context, I ran into this when trying to decode an Avro record where the writer schema had fields not present in the reader schema. The decoder would attempt to skip the unneeded data in the stream, but would throw an EOFException because the return value was wrong.
