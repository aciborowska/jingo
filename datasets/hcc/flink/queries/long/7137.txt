Right now FlinkTypeFactory does conversion between Flink TypeInformation to Calcite RelDataType by assuming the following: 

All top level fields will be set to nullable and all nested fields within CompositeRelDataType and GenericRelDataType will be set to Calcite default (which is non-nullable). 

This triggers Calcite SQL optimization engine drop all `IS NOT NULL` clause on nested fields, and would not be able to optimize when top level fields were actually non-nullable.
