My goal is to create a window from 0am to the next day's 0am within GMT+8 timezone, so I choose to use TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Time.of(1, TimeUnit.DAYS)), which uses UTC timezone to implement the range of "day". And it doesn't allow me to write an offset -8 in the TumblingEventTimeWindows, which can help me fix the offset of timezone.
