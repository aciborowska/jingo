Several fields of Scala UDFs contain values that need not be serialized, because they are initialized in configure() or open().

In some cases, these fields may contain non-serializable values, causing the programs to fail.

All basic function fields (serializers, etc...) should be marked as transient, if they should not be part of the serialized object.
