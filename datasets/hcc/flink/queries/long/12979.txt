When sending data to kafka using CsvRowSerializationSchema, the CsvRowSerializationSchema#serialize method helps generating value for KafkaRecord,  which will call  CsvEncoder#endRow and in which  a _cfgLineSeparator will be added at the end of KafkaRecord.value.

But For  CsvRowSerializationSchema#Builder , when you calling the mothod setLineDelimiter only "\n","\r","\r\n" could be used as the parameter.  

It's not friendly when you want to send a message "123,pingpong,21:00" to kafka but kafka receives a message  "123,pingpong,21:00\r\n".

I'm not sure about the reason for limitting the lineDelimiter to "\n","\r","\r\n" ï¼Ÿ In previous version and jackson-databind, there's no limits on lineDelimiter. 

But at least it should let the application developer to set LineDelimiter with "".
