UniqueKeyExtractor will return a tuple, the first element is the name of a key field, the second is a group name that is shared by all equivalent key fields. The group names are used to identify same keys, for example: select('pk as pk1, 'pk as pk2), both pk1 and pk2 belong to the same group, i.e., pk1. Here we use the lexicographic smallest attribute as the common group id.
Currently, when extract unique keys from DataStreamCalc, the generated group id is not the lexicographic smallest attribute.
