I saw a NPE while archiving a ExecutionVertex:

execution graph org.apache.flink.runtime.executiongraph.ExecutionGraph@c4e0722 for archiving.
java.lang.NullPointerException: null
	at org.apache.flink.runtime.executiongraph.ExecutionVertex.prepareForArchiving(ExecutionVertex.java:583)
	at org.apache.flink.runtime.executiongraph.ExecutionJobVertex.prepareForArchiving(ExecutionJobVertex.java:439)
	at org.apache.flink.runtime.executiongraph.ExecutionGraph.prepareForArchiving(ExecutionGraph.java:1042)
...



I think this is due to the newly introduced EvictingBoundedList which returns a default element (null)) for evicted elements when iterating over it. 

This affects the backport to release-1.1 only.
