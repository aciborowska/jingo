A user has reported on the ML that the FileUploadHandler does not accept any files anymore if the upload directory was deleted after the cluster has been started.
A cursory glance at the code shows that it currently uses Files.createDirectory(...) to create a temporary directory for the current request to store uploaded files in.
Changing this to use Files.createDirectories(...) instead should prevent this from happening again.
