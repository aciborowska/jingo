The type analyzer of the ScalaAPI treats BitSet as a ListType. When the unapply method of the ListType is called with a BitSet type then it will be considered a TraversableType. However, within the TraversableType unapply method there is an non-exhaustive pattern matching which fails with BitSet. There is also a comment which says "TODO: make sure this works as it should". As a result, the user only sees that some implicit evidence parameters of type TypeInformation are missing, because they weren't generated. From the user perspective, it would be nice to receive a more meaningful error message.
