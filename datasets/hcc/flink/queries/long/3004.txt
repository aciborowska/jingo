I have a n "integration test" of my streaming flow. It creates a ForkableFlinkMiniCluster in the JUnit @BeforeClass method, to which test streams are submitted. My flow involves a custom RichCoFlatMapFunction. In this function, I finish object initialization via the void open(Configuration) method.

When I submit the flow to a local streaming cluster, it runs without incident. However, submitting the flow in my integration test via maven surefire plugin has the effect of open never being called and my object being consumed without complete initialization.
