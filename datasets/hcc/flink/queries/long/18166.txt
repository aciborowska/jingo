when I start flink

I got error

Please specify JAVA_HOME. Either in Flink config ./conf/flink-conf.yaml or as system-wide JAVA_HOME.

But I have already written:

export JAVA_HOME=~/Java/jdk1.8.0_131

in .bashrc and open a New Terminal to Fresh it.

Why my Flink can not recognise the variable set in environment ?

 

Thanks for your help~!
