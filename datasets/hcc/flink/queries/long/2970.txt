I'm running a YARN session with 2 physical nodes and 5 containers (ApplicationMaster and 4 TaskManagers). There is no Flink program submitted to the cluster.

Running a sequence of failure operations (killing the ApplicationMaster and TaskManager containers), I sometimes get an infinite loop of


15:45:29,719 WARN  Remoting                                                      - Tried to associate with unreachable remote address [akka.tcp://flink@10.240.0.3:58926]. Address is now gated for 5000 ms, all messages to this address will be delivered to dead letters. Reason: Connection refused: /10.240.0.3:58926



I see that the ApplicationMaster container has been started though.

I would not block the RC on this and address it for 0.10.1 or 1.0.
