	HDFS security token support (resolves https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/issues/492)
	"ship/" directory to transfer files to all TaskManagers (user-files)
	Log4j-based logging (YARN now respects the logging configuration) (resolves https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/issues/493)
	the YARN-client deletes all "temp" files from HDFS.
	The JVMs started by YARN now respect the configured JVM opts in the yaml-file (resolves https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/issues/501)
	the JobManager webinterface shows the log file (e.g it is aware of the YARN-specific log-directory)
	The YARN-client now creates a hidden ".yarn-jobmanager" with the address of the JobManager in YARN. users do not have to specify the -m argument anymore.
	Fix a little bug with the JobManager's "cloud" model for taskManager with less that 1GB memory.
	TM ports are now assigned based on the ports availability on the machine. (Users can still "hardcode" a port)
