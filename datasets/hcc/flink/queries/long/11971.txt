When I did the end-to-end test under Mac OS, I found the following two problems:
 1. The verification returned for different `minikube status` is not enough for the robustness. The strings returned by different versions of different platforms are different. the following misjudgment is caused:
 When the `Command: start_kubernetes_if_not_ruunning failed` error occurs, the `minikube` has actually started successfully. The core reason is that there is a bug in the `test_kubernetes_embedded_job.sh` script.  The error message as follows:
  


Current check logic: echo ${status} | grep -q "minikube: Running cluster: Running kubectl: Correctly Configured"

==== My local info====
jinchengsunjcs-iMac:flink-1.8.0 jincheng$ minikube status

host: Running

kubelet: Running

apiserver: Running

kubectl: Correctly Configured: pointing to minikube-vm at 192.168.99.101

So, I think we should improve the check logic of `minikube status`, What do you think?
