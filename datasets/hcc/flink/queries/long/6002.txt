On https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.2/quickstart/setup_quickstart.html#setup-download-and-start-flink , command lines in "MacOS X" part are not rendered correctly.

This is because the markdown is misformatted - it doesn't leave a blank line between text and code block.

So the fix is simple - add a blank line between text and code block.
