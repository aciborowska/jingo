After shutting down a local Flink instance that was started with the ./bin/start-local.bat script and on which a job was executed as suggested via CTRL-C, the JobManager log file shows an ERROR message:


14:24:18,547 ERROR org.apache.flink.runtime.blob.BlobCache                       - BLOB cache failed to properly clean up its storage directory.
