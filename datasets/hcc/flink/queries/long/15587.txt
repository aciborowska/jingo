Trying to run Flink (flink:latest) on OpenShift (3.11) does not work.

The output is:

Starting standalonesession daemon on host flink-jobmanager-7949d5c546-49cc8. /opt/flink/bin/flink-daemon.sh: line 127: /opt/flink/log/flink--standalonesession-0-flink-jobmanager-7949d5c546-49cc8.out: Permission denied


Since OpenShift is a locked down Container Environment, the rights inside the Container are probably not minimized and too broad.
