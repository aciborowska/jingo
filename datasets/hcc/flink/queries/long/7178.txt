The Datadog metric reporter has dependencies on com.squareup.okhttp3 and com.squareup.okio.  It appears there was an attempt to Maven Shade plug-in to move these classes to org.apache.flink.shaded.okhttp3 and org.apache.flink.shaded.okio during packaging.  Alas, the shaded classes are not included in the flink-metrics-datadog-1.3.1.jar released to Maven Central.  Using the Jar results in an error when the Jobmanager or Taskmanager starts up because of the missing dependencies.
