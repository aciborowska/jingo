It seems that evaluate operation is defined for Vector and not LabeledVector.
It impacts QuickStart guide for FlinkML when using SVM.

We need to update the documentation as follows:

val astroTest:DataSet[(Vector,Double)] = MLUtils
      .readLibSVM(env, "src/main/resources/svmguide1.t")
      .map(l => (l.vector, l.label))

val predictionPairs = svm.evaluate(astroTest)
