In ZH version pages of flink-web, the anchors are not generated based on ZH characters. The anchor name would be like 'section-1', 'section-2' if there is no EN characters. An example can be the links in the navigator of https://flink.apache.org/zh/contributing/contribute-code.html

This makes it impossible to ref an anchor from the content because the anchor name might change unexpectedly if a new section is added.

Note that it is a problem for flink-web only. The docs generated from the flink repo can properly generate ZH anchors.
