Currently the YarnResourceManager and YarnApplicationMasterRunner always register the additional jars using the YARN filesystem object. This is problematic as the paths might require another filesystem.

To support localizing from non-HDFS paths (e.g., s3, http or viewfs), the cleaner approach is to get the filesystem object from the path.
