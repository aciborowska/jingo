The AbstractRestHandler parses the request and tries to generate a HandlerRequest. If this fails, then the server answers with an internal server error. Instead we should allow the AbstractRestHandler to be able to return a BAD_REQUEST status code. In order to do that, I would like to introduce a HandlerRequestException which can be thrown while creating the HandlerRequest. If this exception is thrown, then we return an error message with BAD_REQUEST HttpResponseStatus.
