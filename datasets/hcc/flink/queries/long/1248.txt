When i opened the .html files created by the build_docs.sh script no CSS or images were applied. a quick investigation found leading '/' in a lot of relative paths to be the cause, ex.:
(taken from config.html)


  <head>
    ...
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/bootstrap.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/bootstrap-lumen-custom.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/syntax.css">



removing these causes the website to be shown properly.
