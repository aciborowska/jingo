I use the flink in yarn cluster of version 1.2.0.  The HA is configured in flink-conf.yaml, but the sasl is disabled. The configurations are :
high-availability: zookeeper
high-availability.zookeeper.quorum: 100.106.40.102:2181,100.106.57.136:2181,100.106.41.233:2181
high-availability.zookeeper.storageDir: hdfs:/flink
high-availability.zookeeper.client.acl: open
high-availability.zookeeper.path.root:  flink0308
zookeeper.sasl.disable: true
The client log、JobManager log、TaskManager log are contain the following error information:

2017-03-22 11:18:24,662 WARN  org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn                               - SASL configuration failed: javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: No JAAS configuration section named 'Client' was found in specified JAAS configuration file: '/tmp/jaas-441937039502263015.conf'. Will continue connection to Zookeeper server without SASL authentication, if Zookeeper server allows it.
