In the docs about https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.4/dev/datastream_api.html#iterator-data-sink, it's mentioned that one could use an interator for retrieving the result of the stream.

But there is no mention of any external packages (as it happens with some examples in the metrics) and trying to use causes an error:

[error] object contrib is not a member of package org.apache.flink
[error] import org.apache.flink.contrib.streaming.DataStreamUtils

The line in question (as copied'n'pasted directly from the examples):

import org.apache.flink.contrib.streaming.DataStreamUtils
