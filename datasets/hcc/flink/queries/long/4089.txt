Here is related code:

    if(pollingRunner == null) {
      LOG.warn("YarnClusterClient.getApplicationStatus() has been called on an uninitialized cluster." +
          "The system might be in an erroneous state");
    }
    ApplicationReport lastReport = pollingRunner.getLastReport();


If pollingRunner is null, NPE would result from the getLastReport() call.
