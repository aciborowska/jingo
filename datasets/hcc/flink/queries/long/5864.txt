Currently when searching for a pattern a,b,c and we have input elements a -> b1 -> b2 ->c where b1 and b2 are both valid elements for the position b, then instead of having an output of 2 matched patterns: a, b1, c and a, b2, c, we have 4, with 2 copies of each valid pattern.

The problem is with the creation of Dewey number, cause it is not increased on graph branching.
