The JobManager logfile often contains exceptions like the one attached for failing tasks.

The exception is confusing users since they assume a bug in the system. It is actually not a real bug in the system, its the inability of the ExecutionGraph to properly handle asynchronous tasks.

```
21:59:03,350 INFO  eu.stratosphere.nephele.execution.ExecutionStateTransition    - JM
: ExecutionState set from CANCELING to FAILED for task Map(ItemVectorMapper) (6/9)
21:59:03,350 ERROR eu.stratosphere.nephele.execution.ExecutionStateTransition    - java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unexpected state change: CANCELING -> FAILED

        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:640)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:853)
```

Has anybody a suggestion how to solve it?
Just remove the exception for this particular state transition?
