Flink's code is written against slf4j

To make sure users can use their custom logging framework we need to have


	no direct compile-scope dependency in any core
	a dependency in flink-dist that is not in the fat jar
	an explicit dependency in examples (to see logs when running in the IDE)
	an explicit test dependency (for logs of test execution)



All except point (1) are already fixed.
