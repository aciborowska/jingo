Consider the following case:

	Two IntputGates
	Input selection is not ALL (say FIRST initially)
	Unaligned Checkpoints ON
	on recovery, there are "parts" of records in all channels (actually 1 is enough I think)



What happens:

	StreamTask initiates recovery and scedule partition request upon it's end
	All gates and channels will receive buffers from StateReader
	All channels of a single gate will consume those state buffers - completing that gate's StateConsumedFuture
	InputProcessor will return NOTHING_AVAILABLE (see StreamTwoInputProcessor.getInputStatus)
	StreamTask will suspend its default action
	State of the 2nd gate won't be consumed - so its StateConsumedFutures won't be completed - so no partitions will be requested



Solution: request partitions independently for each channel.
