All modules that contain a package-info.java file (that do not contain annotations which applies to all instances in Flink) will always be recompiled by the maven-compiler-plugin.

To detect modified files the compiler compares timestamps of the source and .class file. In the case of package-info.java no .class file is created if it doesn't contain annotations, which the compiler interprets as a missing .class file.

We can add -Xpkginfo:always to the compiler configuration to force the generation of these files to prevent this from happening.
