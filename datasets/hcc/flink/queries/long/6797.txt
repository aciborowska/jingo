The script for building the docs installs the latest version of the bundler ruby gem (if it can't find the bundle command, which is always the case on the build-bots, for example). Since the release of bundler 1.15 this fails because it is now pickier about dependency checking, and we somehow ended up with an invalid dependency rule in Gemfile.lock.
