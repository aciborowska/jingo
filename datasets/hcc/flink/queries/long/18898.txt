I noticed thatÂ .flink-runtime.version.properties file does not exist in flink-dist jar file. Due to lack of this property file, running 'flink --version' returns unknown version.

If I rename the '.flink-runtime.version.properties' file to 'flink-runtime.version.properties', I was able to contain the property file in the flink-dist jar. If this approach is fine, I'll create the pull request. If not, I would like to know the best way to work around the problem.
