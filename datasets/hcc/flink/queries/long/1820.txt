Hi,

I found the bug, when I wanted to read a csv file, which had a line like:
"||\n"

If I treat it as a Tuple2<Long,Long>, I get as expected a tuple (0L,0L).

But if I want to read it into a Double-Tuple or a Float-Tuple, I get the following error:

java.lang.AssertionError: Test failed due to a org.apache.flink.api.common.io.ParseException: Line could not be parsed: '||'
ParserError NUMERIC_VALUE_FORMAT_ERROR 

This error can be solved by adding an additional condition for empty strings in the FloatParser / DoubleParser.

We definitely need the CSVReader to be able to read "empty values".

I can fix it like described if there are no better ideas
