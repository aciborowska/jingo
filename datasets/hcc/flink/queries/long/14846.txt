When introduce RocksDBConfigurableOptions, the default writer buffer size is referenced from RocksDB's javadoc. Unfortunately, RocksDB's official javadoc was described incorrectly as 4MB for a long time until I create a PR to correct it. This also leads our description of default write-buffer size not correct, we should fix this to avoid to mislead users.
