The current monitoring of files sets the internal variable `globalModificationTime` to filter out files that are "older". However, the current test (to check "older") does 

`boolean shouldIgnore = modificationTime <= globalModificationTime;` (rom `shouldIgnore`)

The comparison should strictly be SMALLER (NOT smaller or equal). The method documentation also states "This happens if the modification time of the file is smaller than...".

The equality acceptance for "older", makes some files with same exact timestamp to be ignored. The behavior is also non-deterministic, as the first file to be accepted ("first" being pretty much random) makes the rest of files with same exact timestamp to be ignored.
