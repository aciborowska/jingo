Enabled Flink metrics reporting using Graphite using system scopes that contain '<host>' for both the job manager and task manager.  The resulting metrics reported to Graphite use two different representations for '<host>'.

For Task Manager metrics it uses the short hostname (without the DNS domain).  This is a result of logic in org.apache.flink.runtime.taskmanager.TaskManagerLocation constructor that tries to extract the short hostname from the fully qualified domain name looked up from InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName().

For Job Manager metrics it uses the fully qualified domain name (with the DNS domain). This is a result of there being no logic in org.apache.flink.runtime.jobmanager.JobManagerRunner or org.apache.flink.runtime.rpc.akka.AkkaRpcService to perform equivalent normalization of the fully qualified domain name down to the short hostname.

Ideally the '<host>' placeholders in the system scopes for the job manager and task manager related metrics would be replaced with a consistent value (either the short hostname or the fully qualified domain name).  Even better if there was a configuration option to decide which one should be used for metric name generation.
