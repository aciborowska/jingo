I am using Flink 1.9.0 on EMR (emr 5.28), with StreamingFileSink using an S3 filesystem.

I want flink to write to an S3 bucket which is running in another AWS account, and I want to do that by assuming a role in the other account. This can be easily accomplished by providing a custom credential provider (similar to https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/securely-analyze-data-from-another-aws-account-with-emrfs/)

 

As described in https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/ops/filesystems/#pluggable-file-systems, I copied flink-s3-fs-hadoop-1.9.0.jar to the plugins directory. But the configuration parameter 'fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider' is getting shaded https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-filesystems/flink-s3-fs-hadoop/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/fs/s3hadoop/S3FileSystemFactory.java#L47}}, and so are all the aws sdk dependencies, so when I provide a custom credential provider, it complained that I was not implementing the correct interface (AWSCredentialsProvider) 

The fix made in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-13044 allows users to use one of the built-in credential providers like `InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider`, but still does not help with providing custom credential providers.
