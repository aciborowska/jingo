The issue was reported here: http://apache-flink-user-mailing-list-archive.2336050.n4.nabble.com/YARN-High-Availability-td3558.html

Dynamic properties (for example the zookeeper root path) are not properly passed to the leader election service on the client.
The election service is using the configuration values from the config file instead of the properties dynamically passed.
