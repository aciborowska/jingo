We found out that the current external catalog requires three layers of references for any tables. For example, the SQL would look like the following when referencing external table:


SELECT * FROM catalog.db.table



It would be great to support only two layers of indirections which is closer to many of the deployment on Presto / Hive today.


SELECT * FROM db.table
