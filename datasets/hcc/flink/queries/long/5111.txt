Currently we use the Object.hashCode method as an intermediate step to assign an item to a key group. According to the java documentation:

"This integer (returned by the method) need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application."

This means that a key may be assigned to another keygroup after restoring. This can easily break the semantics of a pipeline.
