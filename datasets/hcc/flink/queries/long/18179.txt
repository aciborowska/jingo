When execute sql like this, will throw expection "org.apache.flink.table.planner.codegen.CodeGenException: Unsupported call: TUMBLE_END(TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL) 
If you think this function should be supported, you can create an issue and start a discussion for it."



tableEnv.sqlUpdate("CREATE VIEW temp_view AS SELECT '1' AS type, pt FROM source");
tableEnv.sqlUpdate("INSERT INTO sink " +
	"SELECT " +
	"  type, " +
	"  TUMBLE_END(pt, INTERVAL '5' SECOND) AS end, " +
	"  COUNT(1) " +
	"FROM " +
	"  temp_view " +
	"GROUP BY " +
	"  type, " +
	"  TUMBLE(pt, INTERVAL '5' SECOND)");




AggregateProjectPullUpConstantsRule is apply before WindowPropertiesRules for now, it will generate a LogicProject node after LogicalWindowAggregate, WindowPropertiesRules will not match the last LogicProject include auxiliary function.

I think put AggregateProjectPullUpConstantsRule after WindowPropertiesRules will fix it easily.
