After a job submitted to a LocalEnvironment finishes, some threads are not stopped, and are stuck in waiting forever.

You can observe this, if you enclose the body of the main function of the WordCount example with a loop that executes 100 times, and monitor the thread count (with VisualVM for example).

(The problem only happens if I use a mini cluster. If I use start-local.sh and submit jobs to it, then there is no leak.)
