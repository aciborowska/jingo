WebUI relies on ExecutionGraph#failureInfo and Execution#failureCause to generate error info (via JobExceptionsHandler#createJobExceptionsInfo). 
Errors happen in the scheduling of DefaultScheduler are not recorded into those fields, thus cannot be shown to users in WebUI (nor via REST queries).

To solve it, 
1. global failures should be recorded into ExecutionGraph#failureInfo, via ExecutionGraph#initFailureCause which can be exposed as SchedulerBase#initFailureCause.
2. for task failures, one solution I can think of is to avoid invoking DefaultScheduler#handleTaskFailure directly on scheduler's internal failures. Instead, we can introduce ExecutionVertexOperations#fail(ExecutionVertex) to hand the error to ExecutionVertex as a common failure.
