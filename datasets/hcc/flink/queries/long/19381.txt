Although savepoints are relocatable since Flink 1.11, the docs still state otherwise, for example in https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/ops/state/savepoints.html#triggering-savepoints

The warning there, as well as the other changes from FLINK-15863, should be removed again and potentially replaces with new constraints.

One known constraint is that if taskowned state is used (GenericWriteAhreadLog sink), savepoints are currently not relocatable yet.
