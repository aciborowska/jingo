Run a job with FS state backend and enable checkpointing.

Cancel the job.

In the checkpoint directory, you have an empty directory with the job ID  (:checkpointDir>/:jobID).

The FsCheckpointStreamFactory creates this directory, but it is never called to clean it up again (in general, the stream factories have no hooks to do clean up).
