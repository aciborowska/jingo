Based on https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/setup/config.html, you should be able to specify the same temp directory name multiple times. This works for some of the Flink infrastructure (e.g. the TaskManager's temp file directory), but not for FileCache.

The problem is that the FileCache() constructor tries to use the same random directory name for each of the specified temp dir locations, so after the first directory is created, the second create fails.
