Migrating from Flink 1.1 fails for CEP, since in 1.1, the legacy MultiplexingStreamRecordSerializer is used for stream  elements in the serialized priority queue (via the PriorityQueueSerializer).

In newer versions, the StreamElementSerializer is used instead. For this to work, we need to implement the compatibility methods for StreamElementSerializer such that it is also compatible with configuration snapshots taken from the MultiplexingStreamRecordSerializer.
