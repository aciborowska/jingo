Very often when executing a plan using the LocalExecutor and calling stop() it happens that there are lingering threads and the program won't stop. It does not seem to happen when simply starting the LocalExecutor and then stopping.

Does anyone have any idea why this is happening. It is really annoying and I want to use this in the upcoming ExecutionContext.
