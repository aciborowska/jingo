I find flink taskmanager exit caused by OOM ,and I dumped the head file.
Â 

The result is that the static variables are not released when canceled the job, and a new object is generated after I restarted the job.

The static variable is multiple for the slot memory isolation.

How could I make the variables collected by the Flink?

multiple static variable

path to gc
