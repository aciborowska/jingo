Currently the WindowOperator checkpoints the processing time timers, but upon recovery it does not re-registers them with the TimeServiceProvider. To actually reprocess them it relies on another element that will come and register a new timer for a future point in time. Although this is a realistic assumption in long running jobs, we can remove this assumption by re-registering the restored timers with the TimeServiceProvider in the open() method of the WindowOperator.
