 The Task Manager automatically started by the Job Manager (JobManager.scala, appr. line  470)  in the local mode does not listen on the dataport. 

To reproduce:
1) Start Flink via ./start-local.sh
2) Look up the data port number on locahost:8081 -> "Task Managers" tab
3) sudo netstat -taupen | grep "dataport_number "

Or  start the second Task Manager and run  Flink with the degree of parallelism 2 (assuming one slot per Task Manager)
4) ./flink run -p 2 ...

Task Managers started via ./taskmanager.sh work fine.
