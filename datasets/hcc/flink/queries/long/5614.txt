As you can see here: https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/flink/flink-core/1.2-SNAPSHOT/

The 1.2-SNAPSHOT repository didn't update since Dec 20. That's exactly the day when I forked off the release-1.2 branch from master.
So it seems that the current infrastructure to build the nightly's / snapshot versions only builds master, not the release branches.

I think this is the corresponding Jenkins build: https://builds.apache.org/view/All/job/flink-snapshot-deployment/

Snapshot deployment was moved from Travis from Jenkins here: FLINK-3383

I added this JIRA mostly to see if others stumbled across this as well, and whether there's enough interest in fixing the issue.
