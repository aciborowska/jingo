ExternalProcessRunner tries to detect a ClassNotFoundException in the run process by comparing its output with a fixed string of test; this means that localized text reporting said exception is not interpreted as such.

To reproduce:

	test the `ExternalProcessRunnerTest.testClassNotFound` setting the following system properties on the JVM: -Duser.country=IT -Duser.language=it
