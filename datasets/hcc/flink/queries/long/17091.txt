AvroRow(De)SerializationSchema doesn't know how to convert the new physical classes of Timestamp (eg. java.time.Date) to/from Avro's int/long based timestamp. Currently, when encountering objects of the new physical classes, AvroRow(De)SerializationSchema just ignores them and passes them to Avro's GenericDatumWriter/Reader, which leads to ClassCastException thrown by GenericDatumWriter/Reader. See AvroRowSerializationSchema.

To fix this problem, we should support LocalTime/LocalDate/LocalDateTime conversion to int/long in AvroRowSerializationSchema, and support int/long conversion to LocalTime/LocalDate/LocalDateTime based on logical types(Types.LOCAL_TIME/Types.LOCAL_DATE/Types.LOCAL_DATE_TIME) in AvroRowDeserializationSchema.
