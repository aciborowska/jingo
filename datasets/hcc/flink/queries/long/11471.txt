With queued scheduling enabled (seems to be the default now), the job's status is changed to RUNNING before all tasks are actually running.

Although JobStatus#RUNNING states
Some tasks are scheduled or running, some may be pending, some may be finished.
you may argue whether this is the right thing to report, e.g. in the REST interface, when a user wants to react on the actual state change from SCHEDULED to RUNNING. It seems, some intermediate state is missing here which would clarify things.
