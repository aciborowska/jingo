References to Task objects may under some conditions linger longer than for the lifetime of the task. For example, in case of local network channels, the receiving task may have a reference to the object of the task that produced the data.

To prevent against memory leaks, the Task needs to release all references to its AbstractInvokable when it shuts down or cancels.
