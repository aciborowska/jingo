A recent change of the root pom tries to copy licenses of bundled dependencies into the META-INF/license folder. However, the META-INF folder contains already a file LICENSE which contains the AL2. 

File systems that do not distinguish upper and lower case are not able to create the license folder because the LICENSE file exists.
