The -yst and -yarnstreaming parameter to the Yarn command-line is not in use anymore since FLINK-3073 and should have been removed before the 1.0.0 release. I would suggest to mark the parameter as deprecated in the code and not list it anymore in the help section. In one of the upcoming major releases, we can remove it completely (which would give users an error if they used the flag).
