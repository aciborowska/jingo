The DataSet API offers a CombineFunction interface, which differs from the GroupCombineFunction interface by being restricted to return a single value instead of returning arbitrary many values through a Collector.
The JavaDocs of the GroupCombineFunction point to the CombineFunction interface, advertising it as more efficient.

However, the CombineFunction interface is nor respected by Flink, i.e., a GroupReduceFunction that implements this interface is executed without leveraging the combine method.
