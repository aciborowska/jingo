we can see there are diffirent tests

runElasticsearchSinkTest

runElasticsearchSinkCborTest

runElasticsearchSinkSmileTest

runElasticSearchSinkTest

etc.

And use SourceSinkDataTestKit.verifyProducedSinkData(client, index) to ensure the correctness of results. But all of them use the same index.

That is to say, if the second unit test sink doesn't send successfully. they are also equal when use verifyProducedSinkData
