Flink Client returns zero return code when a job is deliberately canceled. 

Steps to reproduced it:

1. bin/flink run -p 10 -m yarn-cluster -yjm 1024 -ytm 12288 WordCount.jar

2. User externally canceled the job.

3. Job Manager marked the job as CANCELED.

4. Although client code emits following logs, still returns zero return code.

org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.api.impl.YarnClientImpl         - Killed application application_1523726493647_.....

Job scheduler like Airflow would have hard-time detecting whether the submitted job was canceled or not.
