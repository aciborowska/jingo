With very fast checkpoint intervals (few 100 msecs), it can happen that a Task is not ready to start a checkpoint by the time it gets the first checkpoint trigger message.

If some other tasks are ready already and commence a checkpoint, the stream alignment will make the non-participating task wait until the checkpoint expires (default: 10 minutes).

A simple way to fix this is that tasks report back when they could not start a checkpoint. The checkpoint coordinator can then abort that checkpoint and unblock the streams by starting new checkpoint (where all tasks will participate).

An optimization would be to send a special "abort checkpoints barrier" that tells the barrier buffers for stream alignment to unblock a checkpoint.
