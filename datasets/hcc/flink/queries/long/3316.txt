The landing page of flink.apache.org includes links to the Gelly and FlinkML libraries under the text:


Flink also bundles libraries for domain-specific use cases:

1.    Machine Learning library, and
2.    Gelly, a graph processing API and library.

These point to anchor links in the Features page that seem to longer exist.

I guess linking to the docs instead could be a solution.
