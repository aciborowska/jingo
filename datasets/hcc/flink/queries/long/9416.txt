When starting a session cluster, it can happen that the job submission fails if the REST server endpoint has already gained leadership but if the leadership election for the Dispatcher is still ongoing. In such a case, we receive a error response saying that the leader election is still ongoing and fail the job submission. I think it would be nicer to also make the submission step a retriable operation in order to avoid this race condition.
