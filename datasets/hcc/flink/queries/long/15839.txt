Currently, the properties resolution logic in KafkaIngressBuilder is a bit inconsistent for different configurations, and some actually incorrect.
The problem is around the fact that we allow users to directly pass in Properties to configure the Kafka client, but also support named methods to set some important configs like Kafka address / auto offset reset position.

For example, we always overwrite auto.offset.reset set in the properties with the autoOffsetResetPosition value in the builder. This is correct when the user had actually passed in a value via the named method withAutoOffsetResetPosition, but incorrect otherwise.
The same goes for the Kafka address configuration.

This should be revisited, so that we have a common strategy with dealing with named configurations v.s. properties, with an end goal that:


	Configs passed via named methods should always overwrite the value set via properties
	Any default values for named configuration methods should be defined in the builder
	If no config was passed via its named method, then we use the default value (if any) to overwrite the properties IFF the user also did not provide a value for it there.
