Integrations tests that restart a broker (like KafkaXYITCase or KafkaXYProducerITCase), do not ends in the same state as they started, leaving behind slightly degenerated Kafka cluster. 

It seems like each such tests brakes permanently one Kafka broker. As long as in the scope of one test file, there are more Kafka brokers (currently 3) then tests that fail a Kafka broker all tests will pass. If there are 3 or more such tests cases, tests become unstable and can crash with different errors or even live/dead lock.
