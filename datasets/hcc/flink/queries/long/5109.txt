On REST API calls the Flink runtime responds with the header Content-Encoding, containing the value "utf-8". According to the HTTP/1.1 standard this header is invalid. ( https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.5 ) 
Possible acceptable values are: gzip, compress, deflate. Or it should be omitted.
The invalid header may cause malfunction in projects building against Flink.

The invalid header may be present in earlier versions aswell.

Proposed solution: Remove lines from the project, where CONTENT_ENCODING header is set to "utf-8". (I could do this in a PR.)

Possible solution but may need further knowledge and skills than mine: Introduce content-encoding. Doing so may need some configuration beacuse then Flink would have to encode the responses properly (even paying attention to the request's Accept-Encoding headers).
