When I was testing tpcds quries with sqlClient, but it reported the following failure when one query was submitted repeatedly.


[ERROR] Could not execute SQL statement. Reason:
org.apache.flink.table.api.ValidationException: Table 'default: WITH customer_total_return AS
( SELECT
    sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
    sum(sr_return_amt) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM store_returns, date_dim
  WHERE sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
  GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk)
SELECT c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return ctr1, store, customer
WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return >
  (SELECT avg(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
  FROM customer_total_return ctr2
  WHERE ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state = 'TN'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY c_customer_id
LIMIT 100' already exists. Please choose a different name.

I checked the code, it seems that it will always create a new table and registerTableSink, and caused the failure.

I think we can do some work here to fix it.
