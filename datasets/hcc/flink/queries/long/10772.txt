The create_binary_release.sh is broken because it calls a script which does not exist. In fact, this script no longer needs to be called. 

Moreover, the build fails because we skip the compilation and packaging of test dependencies via -Dmaven.test.skip=true. The problem is that test dependencies are still being resolved if this property is specified. See MJAR-138 for more information.
