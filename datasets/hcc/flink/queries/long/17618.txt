When we upgrade the log4j to log4j2, there are some residual log4j logger configuration in the comments. Just like following,

log4j.properties and log4j-console.properties


# Uncomment this if you want to _only_ change Flink's logging
#log4j.logger.org.apache.flink=INFO


We should update them to the log4j2 format.

 


# Uncomment this if you want to _only_ change Flink's logging
logger.flink.name = org.apache.flink
logger.flink.level = INFO
