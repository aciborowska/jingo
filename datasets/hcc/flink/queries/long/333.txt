The Java and the Scala API offer crossWithHuge() and crossWithTiny() API methods that allow the user to give hints to the optimizer about the size of the inputs a cross.
However, these hints are not considered and all cross transformations are handled the same by the optimizer. 

Similiar hints for Join exist and are implemented correctly.
