TaskExecutor will reconnect to the new ResourceManager leader when JM failed, and JobMaster will restart and reschedule job. If job slot request arrive earlier than TM registration, RM will start new workers rather than reuse the existing TMs.
Itâ€˜s hard to reproduce becasue TM registration usually come first, and timeout check will stop redundant TMs. 
But I think it would be better if we make the recoverWokerNode to interface, and put recovered slots in pendingSlots wait for TM reconnection.
