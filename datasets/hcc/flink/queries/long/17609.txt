Currently, the PythonDriver will always construct the python execution command with "-m" option, which means uses code files will run as a module, E.g, "python -m <module_name>". However, when user specifies the "-py" option followed by the entry script file path, we should directly execute the user specified script, such as "python <entry_script_file_path>".

The difference between "python <entry_script_file_path>" and "python -m <module_name>" is as follow:
    "python <entry_script_file_path>" will add the parent directory of the entry script to the PYTHONPATH so that all modules under the directly can be found when executing the script.
    "python -m <module_name>" will only add the current execution directory to the PYTHONPATH, which may cause "ModuleNotFoundError" when the entry module references other modules under the same directory.
