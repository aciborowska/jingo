A user ran into the problem that the SubmitJob message is not (de)serialisable if it contains custom RocksDB options (or a custom state backend): [1]

The problem is that SubmitJob contains a JobGraph which contains JobCheckpointingSettings which contains a StateBackend. This StateBackend potentially has user code and therefore can only be deserialised with the user classloader.

This issue is mostly identical to FLINK-6531.
