JDBCInputFormat.nextRecord(..) assumes that a NullPointerException could only occur by the resultSet being null. It rethrows an exception with the message "Couldn't access resultSet". See FLINK-3471 for an example of where the NPE could come from another situation. Either the message should be changed or the scope of the try/catch should be tightened around the resultSet.next();
