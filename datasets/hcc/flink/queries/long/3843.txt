The StreamFaultToleranceTestBase, which is the base class for checkpointing tests defines no maximum number of retries. This can lead to a test either succeeding and terminating, or failing silently and restarting indefinitely.

The change can just consist of adding something like:

env.getConfig().setRestartStrategy(RestartStrategies.fixedDelayRestart(3, 0));

to the runCheckpointedProgram() method.
