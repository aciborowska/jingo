FLINK-17350 let the task fail immediately once sync phase of checkpoint failed. However, the included commit 'Simplify checkpoint exception handling' actually would not fail the task if the runnable of () -> notifyCheckpointComplete throwing exception out.
In a nutshell, this actually changes previous checkpoint exception handling.

Moreover, that part of code also affect the implemented code of notifyCheckpointAbortAsync when I introduce notifyCheckpointAborted on task side.
