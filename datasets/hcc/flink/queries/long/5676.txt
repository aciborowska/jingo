tEnv
  .fromDataSet(pojoWithinnerPojo)
  .groupBy("innerPojo.get('line')")
  .select("innerPojo.get('line')")



fails with 


ValidationException: Cannot resolve [innerPojo] given input ['innerPojo.get(line)].



I don't know if we want to support that but the exception should be more helpful anyway.
