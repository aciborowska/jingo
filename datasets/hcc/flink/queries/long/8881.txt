The FLIP-6 TaskExecutor is never sending the current state of accumulators to the JobMaster. They are only updated if the job is finished.

The legacy TaskManager did this regularly as part of the heartbeat to the JobManager.

This is a regression and blocks the porting of some tests (like the SavepointMigrationTestBase) that makes use of accumulators to determine when the job shutdown condition is fulfilled.
