The temporary channel files are not properly deleted if the IOManager does not shut down properly. This can be the case when the TaskManagers are terminated by Flink's shell scripts.

A solution could be to store all channel files of one TaskManager in a uniquely identifiable directory and to register a shutdown hook which deletes this file upon termination.
