The java doc of `JobExecutionResult.getAccumulatorResult` states that "Returns {@code null}, if no accumulator with that name was produced", but actually an NPE will be triggered if no accumulator with that name is produced.

I'm going to rewrite the `getAccumulatorResult` method to the following:


public <T> T getAccumulatorResult(String accumulatorName) {
   OptionalFailure<Object> result = this.accumulatorResults.get(accumulatorName);
   if (result != null) {
      return (T) result.getUnchecked();
   } else {
      return null;
   }
}


Please assign this issue to me if this solution is acceptable.
