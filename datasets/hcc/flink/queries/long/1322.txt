The Scala API does not have output methods which do not take a WriteMode parameter. As default value the NO_OVERWRITE is set. Consequently, a possible global WriteMode set in the configuration is always overwritten. The Java API behaves differently, if no WriteMode is provided. We should sync both APIs to guarantee consistent behaviour.
