As I've been running some tests, three suites (KMeansWithBroadcastSetITCase.java, ScalaCsvReaderWithPOJOITCase.scala and CsvReaderITCase.java) kept failing locally because the expected results (string literals) were matched against an object rendered as a string using the String.format method, a method whose result depends on the default Locale; as my Locale (Italian) renders doubles with a comma instead of a dot as the decimal separator, the representation of doubles diverged from the expected one, thus making my tests fail, despite the results actually being correct.

As the result is hard-coded, it makes sense to explicitly use the US locale to represent those object. I'll open a PR with my solution ASAP.
