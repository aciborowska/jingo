There are several places that use JobId.toShortString() instead of the full JobID, for unique directories, etc.

I think we should drop that method.

	If the short String representation (8 bytes) is statistically "unique enough", then it is wrong in the first place that the unique IDs have 16 bytes
	If 16 bytes were chosen with a purpose, then using the short string representation in paths, etc, is clearly violating the guarantees the IDs try to give,



For purely informational logging, it may be a nice util, bit it seems to encourage wrong use.
