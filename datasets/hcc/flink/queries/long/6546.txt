After the build/shade phase, flink-mesos has various additional direct dependencies on unrelated artifacts.
That is due to the fact that it inherits them from its dependencies through the promotion of transitive dependencies in the shade phase.

In addition, some directly required dependencies are missing and only accidentally inherited, for example jackson.
