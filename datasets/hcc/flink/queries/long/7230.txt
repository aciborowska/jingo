The travis builds currently fail sometimes because for some reason snapshot artifacts are downloaded when executing tests, after compilation. This causes issues for the java 7 profiles, as the snapshot artifacts are released with java 8.

The cause for this is currently unknown; I'm currently trying builds that forbid downloading snapshot artifacts or downloading artifacts during testing in general.

Since this issue doesn't always occur I will run these tests multiple times until tomorrow, and if the issue hasn't appeared again will open a PR.
