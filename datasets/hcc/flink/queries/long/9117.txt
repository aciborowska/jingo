In the current implementation, the mesos fetcher needs to download all artifacts from artifact server. However this is not necessary whenÂ mesos.resourcemanager.tasks.container.type is set to docker since we can include docker artifacts in the docker image. So the issue will add a configuration so that we can disable downloading of artifacts.
