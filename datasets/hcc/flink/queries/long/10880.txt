When configuring a failover strategy other than "full", DataSet/Batch execution is currently not correct.

This is expected, the failover region strategy is an experimental WIP feature for streaming that has not been extended to the DataSet API.

We need to document this and prevent execution of DataSet features with other failover strategies than "full".
