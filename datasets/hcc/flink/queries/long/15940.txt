It's allready support copy NULL value in FLINK-14642. But still get NPE in network shuffle because of serialize and deserialize function didn't support NULL value. It produces different behaviors when I change operator parallelism.

code


.map().setParallelism(1)
.filter(_ != null).setParallelism(2)



suggestion
Add null flag in serialize, just like PojoSerializer.
