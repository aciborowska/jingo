When users override snapshoteState, they might include logic there which is crucial for the correctness of their application, e.g. finalizing a transaction and buffering the results of that transaction, or flushing events to an external store. Exceptions occurring should lead to failing the job.

Currently, users must make sure to throw a Throwable because any Exception will be caught by the task and reported as checkpointing error, when it could be an application error.

It would be helpful to update the documentation and introduce a special exception that can be thrown for job-related failures, e.g. ApplicationError or similar.
