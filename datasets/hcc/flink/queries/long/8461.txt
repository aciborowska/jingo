We started shading Akka's Netty in Flink 1.4.

The logger configurations (log4j.properties, logback.xml) were not updated to the shaded class names.

One result of this is incorrect/misleading error logging of the Netty handlers during shutdown, which pollute the logs and cause Yarn end-to-end tests to fail.
