The reduce function of the new Java API does not work if the an input object is returned, i.e.,

New example:
```
public T reduce(T value1, T value2) throws Exception {
  value1.setVal(value1.getVal() + value2.getVal());
  return value1;
}
```

This is due to the internal mutable object runtime.

Wrong example:
```
public T reduce(T value1, T value2) throws Exception {
  value1 = value1 + value2;
  return value1;
}
```
