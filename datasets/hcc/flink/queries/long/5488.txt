Here is one example:

    if(jobManagerMemoryMb > maxRes.getMemory() ) {
      failSessionDuringDeployment(yarnClient, yarnApplication);
      throw new YarnDeploymentException("The cluster does not have the requested resources for the JobManager available!\n"
        + "Maximum Memory: " + maxRes.getMemory() + "MB Requested: " + jobManagerMemoryMb + "MB. " + NOTE);
    }



yarnClient implements Closeable.
It should be closed in situations where exception is thrown.
