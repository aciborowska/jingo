`cast` function in blink planner and old planner are different:

in legacy planner:
cast('' as int)  ->  throw NumberFormatException
cast(null as int) -> throw NullPointerException
cast('abc' as int)  -> throw NumberFormatException

but in blink planner:
cast('' as int)  ->  return null
cast(null as int) -> return null
cast('abc' as int)  -> return null

A step forward:
```
create table source 
{
  age int,
  id varchar
}
;
select case when age < 20 then cast(id as bigint) else 0 end from source;
```
queries like above will throw NPE because we will try assign a `null` to a `long` field when the input satisfy `age < 20`.
