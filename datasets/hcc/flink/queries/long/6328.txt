The Checkpoint Store retains the n latest checkpoints.
Savepoints are counted as well, meaning that for settings with 1 retained checkpoint, there are sometimes no retained checkpoints at all, only a savepoint.

That is dangerous, because savepoints must be assumed to disappear at any point in time - their lifecycle is out of control of the CheckpointCoordinator.
