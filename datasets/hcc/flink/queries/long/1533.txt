The scheduler can fail with a NullPointerException if it is not possible to allocate a SharedSlot from an Instance. In the method Scheduler.getFreeSubSlotForTask the allocated SharedSlot is not checked that it is not null. This can cause a program to fail if there is a race condition in scheduling different tasks on the same instance.
