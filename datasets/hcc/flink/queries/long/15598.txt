Currently, YarnClusterDescriptor parses/derives TM process memory size from configuration, store it in ClusterSpecification and validate ClusterSpecification, then overwrite the memory size back to configuration.

This logic is unnecessary. The memory validation is already covered by creating TaskExecutorResourceSpec from configuration in TaskExecutorResourceUtils.

Moreover, the memory size is stored in MB in ClusterSpecification. The accuracy loss may lead to memory validation failure, which prevent the cluster from being deployed.
