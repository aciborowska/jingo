We have observed several TM crashes while deploying larger stateful streaming jobs that use the RocksDB state backend.

As the JVMs crash the logs don't show anything but I have uploaded all the info I have got from the standard output.

This indicates some GC and possibly some RocksDB issues underneath but we could not really figure out much more.
