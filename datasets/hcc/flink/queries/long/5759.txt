Currently, the thread pools of the JobManager do not have any UncaughtExceptionHandler.

While uncaught exceptions are rare (Flink handles exceptions aggressively in most places), when exceptions slip through in these threads (which execute future responses and delayed actions), the JobManager may be in an inconsistent state and not function properly any more.

We should add a handler that results in a process kill in the case of uncaught exceptions. Letting the JobManager be restarted by the respective cluster framework is the only guaranteed way to be safe.
