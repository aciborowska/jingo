The documentation (jobmanager_high_availability.md) incorrectly suggests this configuration template when running on YARN:

high-availability: zookeeper
high-availability.zookeeper.quorum: localhost:2181
high-availability.zookeeper.storageDir: hdfs:///flink/recovery
high-availability.zookeeper.path.root: /flink
high-availability.zookeeper.path.namespace: /cluster_one # important: customize per cluster
yarn.application-attempts: 10



while above it says that the namespace should not be set on YARN because it will be automatically generated.

Also, the documentation still refers to namespace while this has been renamed to cluster-id.
