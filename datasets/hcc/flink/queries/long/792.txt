While debugging the issues of the user mentioned here: https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/issues/791 I found out that the exceptions are not very helpful.

The exception will now contain the file path and the expected types.
I also added a very simple testcase (which is not really relevant but covers the "standard operation"). (and needs no time)
