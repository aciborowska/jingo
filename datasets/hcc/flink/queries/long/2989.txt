The newly added Cancel button doesn't work on Yarn, when accessing via Yarn Web Application proxy. It works fine when we're directly on the web monitor.
The reason is Yarn doesn't allow DELETE requests to the AM yet. It should be enabled in 2.8.0. [YARN-2031, YARN-2084.]
A workaround for now can be to use a GET method instead of DELETE, but that breaks the conventions of REST.
