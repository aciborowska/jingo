We should remove the "local" mode from the JobManager.

Currently, the JobManager has the strange "local" mode where it also starts an embedded Task Manager.

I think that mode has caused confusion / problems:

	No TaskManagers can join the cluster
	TaskManagers do not support querable state
	It is redundant code to maintain



At the same time, the mode does not help at all:

	The MiniCluster does not use that mode
	Starting from scripts, the start-cluster.sh works out of the box, creating a proper local cluster, but in two processes, rather than one.
