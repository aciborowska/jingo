@StephanEwen has unified and cleaned up the configuration parameters: https://github.com/StephanEwen/stratosphere/blob/rename/stratosphere-core/src/main/java/eu/stratosphere/configuration/ConfigConstants.java 

These parameters should be listed in the configuration reference. 
Some of the parameters on the current configuration page are obsolete (either not supported any more, or should not be exposed). 
However, not all relevant parameters are also in ConfigConstants.java (Java home, JM + TM heap space, ...).

Let @StephanEwen know if the ConfigConstants are missing something.
