It will be some different, if we want to support HA for active Kubernetes integration.

	The K8s service is designed for accessing the jobmanager out of K8s cluster. So Flink client will not use HA service to retrieve address of jobmanager. Instead, it always use Kubernetes service to contact with jobmanager via rest client. 
	The Kubernetes DNS creates A and SRV records only for Services. It doesn't generate pods' A records. So the ip address, not hostname, will be used as jobmanager address.



 

All other behaviors will be same as Zookeeper HA for standalone and Yarn.

To fix this problem, we just need some minor changes to KubernetesClusterDescriptor and KubernetesSessionEntrypoint.
