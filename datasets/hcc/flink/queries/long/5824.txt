In a couple of places we convert Strings to bytes and bytes back to Strings without explicitly specifying an encoding. This can lead to problems when client and server default encodings differ.

The task of this JIRA is to go over the whole project and look for conversions where we don't specify an encoding and fix it to specify UTF-8 explicitly.

For starters, we can grep -R 'getBytes()' ., which already reveals many problematic places.
