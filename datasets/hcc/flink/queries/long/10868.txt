Currently, YarnResourceManager does use yarn.maximum-failed-containers as limit of resource acquirement. In worse case, when new start containers consistently fail, YarnResourceManager will goes into an infinite resource acquirement process without failing the job. Together with the https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10848, It will quick occupy all resources of yarn queue.
