Going thru existing Hive doc I found the following issues that should be addressed:
1. Section "Hive Integration" should come after "SQL client" (at the same level).
2. In Catalog section, there are headers named "Hive Catalog". Also, some information is duplicated with that in "Hive Integration"
3. "Data Type Mapping" is Hive specific and should probably move to "Hive integration"
