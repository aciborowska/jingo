The link http://flink.apache.org - Documentation - Snapshot (Development) - 1.2 Javadocs (https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.2/api/java/) points to a directory that does not seem to contain an index.html file so the Javadoc Frame does not get displayed. 

The Javadoc html files for individual classes exist (e.g. https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.2/api/java/org/apache/flink/client/cli/CancelOptions.html) but when clicking from there to Overview or Frames (https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.2/api/java/index.html?org/apache/flink/client/cli/CancelOptions.html) those resources are not found.
