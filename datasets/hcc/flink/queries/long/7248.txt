The checkRestoredNullCheckpointWhenFetcherNotReady is a no longer valid remnant from some of the major refactors in the Flink Kafka Consumer, and can be safely removed. The test was passing only because our AbstractPartitionDiscoverer implementation used in the test base was an empty mock.

The actual expected behaviour for checkpoints when the fetcher is not read is actually now verified in `checkRestoredCheckpointWhenFetcherNotReady`.
