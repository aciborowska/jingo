As discussed in FLINK-11172, time-based operations (GROUP BY windows, OVER windows, time-windowed join, etc.) are inherently bound by time and automatically clean up their state. We should not add state cleanup or TTL for these operators.

If I understand correctly, we should not add the retention logic for rows-bounded operations either. I think we should disable state retention logic for:

	ProcTimeBoundedRangeOver
	ProcTimeBoundedRowsOver
	RowTimeBoundedRangeOver
	RowTimeBoundedRowsOver



Any suggestions are appreciated!
