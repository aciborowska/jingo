CFRO was changed to be created using factory, but the benchmark wasn’t updated.

This resulted in error in CFRO super.dispose as it wasn’t properly initialized.

The error wasn’t reported properly in CFRO (flipped arguments to firstOrSuppressed)

The benchmark was running a job with a restarting strategy, so it repeated indefinitely.
