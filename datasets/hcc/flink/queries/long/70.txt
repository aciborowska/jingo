pact-clients was dependent on pact-examples in order to run
LocalExecuterTest. The problem with that was, that this prevented the
use of the LocalExecuter within the pact-examples module (circular
dependency). Hence the LocalExecuterTest was moved to the pact-test
module and the pact-examples depedency was removed from pact-clients.
