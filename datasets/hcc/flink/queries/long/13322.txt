In BaseArray and BaseMap serializers, their element (or key/value) serializers are not stored in the config snapshot. When restoring the BaseArray/BaseMap serializers from the snapshots, their element/key/value serializers might be incorrect. This situation will happen when user uses his custom kryo serializers as element/key/value serializers.
