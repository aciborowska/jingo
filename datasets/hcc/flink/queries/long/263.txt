It does not fail on my own computers, only on travis but not always on travis:
If it fails, it just hangs.

(The logs are from some test builds with the local distributed executor https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/pull/262, with this test enabled.)

The fails are random, I don't see a correlation between jvm versions or build profiles.
