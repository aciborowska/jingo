Here is the scenario to reproduce the issue

	partition discovery is disabled
	open method throws an exception (e.g. when broker SSL authorization denies request)



In this scenario, run method won't be executed. As a result, partitionDiscoverer.close() won't be called. that caused the connection leak, because KafkaConsumer is initialized but not closed. That has caused outage that brought down our Kafka cluster, when a high-parallelism job got into a restart/failure loop.
