The exceptions that come from chained operators have an non-intuitive chaining structure, that makes the stack traces harder to understand.

For every chained task, there is a "Failed to forward record" exception, before the actual exception comes as a cause.

In the Batch API, we use a special "ExceptionInChainedStubException" that is recognized and un-nested to make chained operator exceptions surface as root exceptions. 

We should do the same for the streaming API.
