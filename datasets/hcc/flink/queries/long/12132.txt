In  FLINK-2021, the example has been changed to ParameterTool, and the parameters of WordCount example should use prefix of "-input" and "-output" . However, the document of /docs/ops/deployment/yarn_setup.md (https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/docs/ops/deployment/yarn_setup.md) has not been changed when describing the example of WordCount on YARN.
