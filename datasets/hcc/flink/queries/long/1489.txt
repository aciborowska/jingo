[~Zentol] reported that the JobManager failed to execute his python job. The reason is that the the JobManager executes blocking calls in the actor thread in the method Execution.sendUpdateTaskRpcCall as a result to receiving a ScheduleOrUpdateConsumers message. 

Every TaskManager possibly sends a ScheduleOrUpdateConsumers to the JobManager to notify the consumers about available data. The JobManager then sends to each TaskManager the respective update call Execution.sendUpdateTaskRpcCall. By blocking the actor thread, we effectively execute the update calls sequentially. Due to the ever accumulating delay, some of the initial timeouts on the TaskManager side in IntermediateResultParititon.scheduleOrUpdateConsumers fail. As a result the execution of the respective Tasks fails.

A solution would be to make the call non-blocking.

A general caveat for actor programming is: We should never block the actor thread, otherwise we seriously jeopardize the scalability of the system. Or even worse, the system simply fails.
