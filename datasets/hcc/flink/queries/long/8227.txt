Currently SharedBufferSerializer.serialize() will create a HashMap and put all the SharedBufferEntry into it. Usually this is not a problem. But we obverse that in some cases the calculation of hashCode may become the bottleneck. The performance will decrease as the number of SharedBufferEdge increases. For looping pattern A*, if the number of SharedBufferEntry is N, the number of SharedBufferEdge is about N * N.
