There are two things that need to be done:

1) in the syntax description in the beginning of the page, we should also include the getSideOutput()

2) in the "Getting late data as a side output" section and for the Java example, it should not be a DataStream<T> result ... but a SingleOutputStreamOperator, if we want to get the late event side output.
