Issue in Scala example in documentation: https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/dev/table/udfs.html#table-functions

Currently it is:


tableEnv.sqlQuery("SELECT a, word, length FROM MyTable LEFT JOIN TABLE(split(a)) as T(word, length) ON TRUE")


Should be (like in Java version):


tableEnv.sqlQuery("SELECT a, word, length FROM MyTable LEFT JOIN LATERAL TABLE(split(a)) as T(word, length) ON TRUE")

LATERAL is missed in Scala version
