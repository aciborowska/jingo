This is second subtask of issue FLINK-7153.

Current allocate strategy can't allocate the slot optimize.  Here is the test case:

JobVertex v1 = new JobVertex("v1", jid1);
JobVertex v2 = new JobVertex("v2", jid2);

SlotSharingGroup group = new SlotSharingGroup();

v1.setSlotSharingGroup(group);
v2.setSlotSharingGroup(group);

v1.setParallelism(2);
v2.setParallelism(4);

v1.setInvokableClass(BatchTask.class);
v2.setInvokableClass(BatchTask.class);

v2.connectNewDataSetAsInput(v1, DistributionPattern.POINTWISE, ResultPartitionType.PIPELINED_BOUNDED);


Currently, after allocate for v1,v2, we got a local partition and three remote partition. But actually, it should be 2 local partition and 2 remote partition. 

The causes of the above problems is becuase that the current allocate strategy is allocate the resource for execution one by one(if the execution can allocate from SlotGroup than get it, Otherwise ask for a new one for it).
