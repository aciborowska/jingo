In the Contribute Code page (https://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html), under "Before you start coding...", it refers to "sensible" parts of the code base that require a design doc:

> If the description of a JIRA issue indicates that its resolution will touch sensible parts of the code base, be sufficiently complex, or add significant amounts of new code, the Flink community might request a design document (most contributions should not require a design document).

Should this be "sensitive" instead?
