Users can add or change the properties for execution behavior through SET command in SQL client CLI, e.g. SET execution.parallelism=10, SET table.optimizer.join-reorder-enabled=true. But the table.xx config can't change the TableEnvironment behavior, because the property set from CLI does not be set into TableEnvironment's table config.
