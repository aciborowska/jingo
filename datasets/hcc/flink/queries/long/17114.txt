When the PyFlink job runs in local mode and the command "python" points to Python 2.7, the startup of the Python UDF worker will fail because "python" is the default interpreter of the Python UDF worker. For this case we need to set the default value of "python.executable" to `sys.executable` i.e. the python interpreter which launches the job.
