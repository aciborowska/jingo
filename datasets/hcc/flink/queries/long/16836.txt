When losing the leadership the JobManagerLeaderListener closes the current rpcConnection but does not clear the field. This can lead to a failure of JobManagerLeaderListener#reconnect if this method is called after the JobMaster has lost its leadership.

I propose to clear the field so that RegisteredRpcConnection#tryReconnect won't be called on a closed rpc connection.
