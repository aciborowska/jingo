I wrote a source like this:

public class Foo extends RichSourceFunction<Bar> {


and then did

ctx.collectWithTimestamp(event, event.eventTimestamp);



I got this error:

Caused by: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Automatic-Timestamp sources cannot emit elements with a timestamp. See interface ManualTimestampSourceFunction if you want to manually assign timestamps to elements.
	at org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.StreamSource$NonTimestampContext.collectWithTimestamp(StreamSource.java:97)



After some digging it turns out that ManualTimestampSourceFunction was renamed to EventTimeSourceFunction and apparently the old name still lingers in this error message.
