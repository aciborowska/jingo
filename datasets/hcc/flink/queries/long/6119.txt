Hi,

I get a question when try to submit a graph to a remote stream RemoteStreamEnvironment in detach mode. 

From the client API, it looks when use call execute().  User doesn't have a way to control whether run in detach mode or not. Since it's the RemoteStreamEnvironment create a StandaloneClusterClient and flag detachedJobSubmission is never get chance to be configured?

Is there any doc on this? I did try but didn't find in doc, or wiki yet...

Thanks
Ralph


This is related to https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2732. But we should be able to make the detach more configurable before a big refactor on the client side.
