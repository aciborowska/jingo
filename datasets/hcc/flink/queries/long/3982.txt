In HA mode, multiple ResourceManagers may register at the leading JobManager. They register one after another at the JobManager. The last registering ResourceManager stays registered with the JobManager. This only applies to Standalone mode and doesn't affect functionality.

To prevent duplicate registration for the standalone ResourceManager, the easiest solution is to only start registration when the leading JobManager runs in the same ActorSystem as the ResourceManager. Other ResourceManager implementations may also run independently of the JobManager.
