The -ynm optional argument is ignored. From my debugging FlinkYarnClientBase does the right thing to parse and set the value. CliFrontend ignores this parsed value, always calling


            flinkYarnClient.setName("Flink Application: " + programName);



down in getClient(CommandLineOptions, String, int). Thus every job submission to YARN is identifiable only by its classname.
