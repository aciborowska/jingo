I built Flink 1.9.1 myself and merged the changes from https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/10936.

When I uploaded the artifacts to our repository (using mvn deploy 
-DaltDeploymentRepository) the build fails as flink-metrics-core-tests will be uploaded twice and we have redeployments disabled.
 
I'm not sure if other artifacts are affected as well, as I enabled redeployment as a quick workaround.
