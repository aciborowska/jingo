Here is the stack trace:
org.apache.flink.runtime.jobmanager.scheduler.NoResourceAvailableException: not connected to ResourceManager and no slot available
	at org.apache.flink.runtime.instance.SlotPool.internalAllocateSlot(SlotPool.java:281)
	at org.apache.flink.runtime.instance.SlotPool.allocateSlot(SlotPool.java:256)

Currently I have to set RestartStrategy to handle this exception. But in some test cases, I want to test failure about the cluster. It will make this much more complicated. After discussing with shuai.xu, maybe we can fix this problem by executing executionGraph after registered to resource manager.
