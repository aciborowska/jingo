Akka may log the following in some cases during shutdown:

java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException: Worker has already been shutdown

The Yarn tests search the logs for unexpected exceptions and fail when encountering that exception. We should whitelist it, as it is not a problem, merely an Akka shutdown artifact.
