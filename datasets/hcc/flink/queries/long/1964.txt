The twitter connector is very hard to use on a cluster because it expects the property file to be present on all nodes.

It would be much easier to ask the user to pass a Properties object immediately.
Also, the javadoc of the class stops in the middle of the sentence.

It was not obvious to me how the two examples TwitterStreaming and TwitterTopology differ. Also, there is a third TwitterStream example in the streaming examples.
The documentation of the Twitter source refers to the non existent TwitterLocal class.
