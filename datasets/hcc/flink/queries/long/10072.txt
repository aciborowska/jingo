There are several issues in the documentation for "The Broadcast State Pattern":

	Indentation mixes up whitespace and tabs, causing the markdown layout to be crippled (especially related to indentation),
	Broken (nested) list layout, causing multi-item lists to be rendered as single-item lists, and
	inconsistent list layout.
