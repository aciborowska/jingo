Reported by Robert Metzger. While creating the input channel deployment descriptors for a job that does not allow lazy deployment (all streaming jobs), Robert got an ExecutionGraphException with the message Trying to eagerly schedule a task whose inputs are not ready in the InputChannelDeploymentDescriptor.

This was not reported as the root cause and is most likely due to a failed producer. For such cases, it makes sense to include the execution state of the producing task so that users see that this is related to the producer.
