	Cassandra Sink use direct memorys.
	Start a standalone cluster(1 machines) for test.
	After the cluster started, check the flink web-ui, and record the task manager's memory info. I mean the direct memory part info.
	Start a job which read from kafka and write to cassandra using the cassandra sink, and you can see that the direct memory count in 'Outside JVM' part go up.
	Stop the job, and the direct memory count is not decreased(using 'jmap -histo:live pid' to make the task manager gc).
	Repeat serveral times, the direct memory count will be more and more.
