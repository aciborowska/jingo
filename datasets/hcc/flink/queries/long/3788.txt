Variable values of non-elementary types aren't caught and distributed to job runners, causing them to remain 'null' and causing NPEs upon access when running on a cluster. Running locally through `flink-clients` works fine.

Changing parallelism or disabling the closure cleaner don't seem to have any effect.

Minimal example, also see the attached archive.

case class IntWrapper(a1: Int)
val wrapped = IntWrapper(42)
env.readTextFile("myTextFile.txt").map(line => wrapped.toString).collect
