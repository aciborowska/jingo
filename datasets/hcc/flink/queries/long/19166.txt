The feedback of User indicates that some partitions have not been committed since the job failed.

This maybe due to FLINK-18110, in FLINK-18110, it has fixed Buckets, but forgot fixing StreamingFileWriter , it should register Listener before the initialization of buckets, otherwise, will loose listening too.
