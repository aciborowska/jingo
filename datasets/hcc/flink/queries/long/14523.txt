We have a Flink application running in AWS on EMR that streams input from a single Kafka topic. Whenever there is a Kafka leader election for any partition of the input topic, our Flink application stops consuming from Kafka entirely. To begin consuming from Kafka again the YARN app must be killed and restarted. We run this same application on premises and in AWS on EMR. We have only observed this behavior when it is running on EMR.
