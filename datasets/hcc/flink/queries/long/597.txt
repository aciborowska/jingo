Some classes also depend on the number of tuples. 
E.g. the `types()` of `CsvReader` or `CLASSES` of `TupleTypeInfo`

@StephanEwen already suggested to extend the TupleGenerator. I would like to do this but I'm not sure how.

What do you think about adding a special comment to these classes so that the tuple generator knows where to put Tuple-dependent code, instead of generating the whole class?

    class CsvReader 
{
        // Constructor, methods etc.
        // ......
        
        // BEGIN_OF_TUPLE_DEPENDENT_CODE
        
        // END_OF_TUPLE_DEPENDENT_CODE
    }
