I added support for local distributed execution environments similar to the LocalDistributedExecutor. For this purpose I generalized the LocalInstanceManager to be able to host multiple TaskManager threads. Local distributed execution should be useful for easy local testing of scheduler strategies. Moreover, this feature might be interesting for local execution on a multi-core system.
