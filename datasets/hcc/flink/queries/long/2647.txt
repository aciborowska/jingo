Currently, operators make no distinction between closing (which needs to emit remaining buffered data) and disposing (releasing resources).

In case of a failure, we want to only release the resources, and not attempt to send pending buffered data.

Effectively, streaming operators need to implement these methods then:

	open()
	processRecord()
	processWatermark()
	close()
	dispose()
