Hello guys,

I've discovered that when deploying the job cluster on Kubernetes, the Job Cluster Manager seems sensitive about the placement of arguments. 

For instance if i put the savepoint argument last, it never reads it. 

For instance if arguments are :


job-cluster --job-classname <classname> --fromSavepoint <savepointPath> --allowNonRestoredState does not pick the savepoint path and does not start from it

job-cluster --fromSavepoint  <savepointPath>  -n --job-classname <classname> -p works for savepoint retrieval
