The recent introduction of key-grouped state breaks queryable state because the JobManager does not yet forward the client to the correct TaskManager based on key-group ranges.

This will either have to be implemented on the JobManager side, i.e. in AkkaKvStateLocationLookupService or on the TaskManager when state is registered. The JobManager can know the mapping because it should know the parallelism/maxParallelism which it can use to determine where the state for a key-group is stored. The TaskManager send a NotifyKvStateRegistered message that already contains a keyGroupIndex field that is not useful/correct at the moment, though.
