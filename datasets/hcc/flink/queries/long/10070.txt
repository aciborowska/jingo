In FLINK-9986 we bumped the version of the git-commit-id-plugin to 2.1.14 which is incompatible with various maven versions, like 3.0.X.

We can either bump the version to 2.2.4 to support all versions, or downgrade to 2.1.9 and rework FLINK-9986 with property exclusions.

Additionally we should setup a test that checks the compatibility of Flink with various maven versions.
