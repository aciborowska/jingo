`query.server.port` & `blob.server.port` variables are continuously appended to the flink-conf.yaml when the job manager restarts.

 

Running a jobmanager & taskmanager using docker-compose

I am using a single `flink-conf.yaml` which is mounted as a volume to a jobmanager and taskmanager container.  Every time the jobmanager restarts, it appends the two variables to the end of the file causing it to grow.
