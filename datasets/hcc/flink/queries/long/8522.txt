In the DefaultOperatorStateBackend at line 283 we write in the checkpoint an int declaring the number of the operator states that we include in the checkpoint. 

This number is never read when restoring and this can lead to confusion and problems with backwards compatibility and/or extension of the types of state we support (e.g. broadcast state).

There are two easy solutions, either remove the line and do not write the size, or make sure that we also read this number when restoring and simply ignore it.

I would go for the first one, i.e. remove the line. What do you think Stefan Richter and Tzu-Li (Gordon) Tai ?
