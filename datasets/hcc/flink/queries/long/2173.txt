Flink gets the temp file path using System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir") while Python uses the "tempfile.gettempdir()" method. However, both can be semantically different.

On my system Flink uses "/tmp" while Pyhton used "/tmp/users/1000" ("1000" is my Linux user-id)

This issues leads (at least) to failing tests.
