Here is related code (there're 3 occurrences in the method):

      in.read(buffer, 0, 4);
      checkForError();


java.io.InputStream.read(byte[], int, int) returns the number of bytes read.
The return value should be checked because checkForError() does this:

    if (getInt(buffer, 0) == -2) {
      try { //wait before terminating to ensure that the complete error message is printed


Incorrect result may be returned if fewer than 4 bytes of data are read.
