The flink web ui displays an inconsistent number of "Records received" / "Records sent” in the job overview "Subtasks" view.

When I run the example wordcount batch job with a small input file on flink 1.3.2 I get

	3 records sent by the first subtask and
	3 records received by the second subtask



This is the result I would expect.


If I run the same job on flink 1.4.0 / 1.5.2 / 1.6.0 I get

	13 records sent by the first subtask and
	3 records received by the second subtask



In real life jobs the numbers are much more strange.
