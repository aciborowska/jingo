After FLINK-4259, I did a check and found that the following files don't have the closing of the FSDataOutputStream.

The following are the files and the corresponding methods missing the close() 
1) FSDataOutputStream.java adding a close method in the abstract class
2) FSStateBackend flush() and write() - closing the FSDataOutputStream
3) StringWriter.java write()
4) FileSystemStateStore putState() -  closing the FSDataOutputStream

5) HadoopDataOutputStream.java not too sure if this needs closing.
6) FileSystemStateStorageHelper.java store() need closing for both outStream and the ObjectOutputStream

The options to think would be to either close or use  IOUtils.closeQuietly() 

Any thoughts?
