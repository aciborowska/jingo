Flink has suffered a regression due to FLINK-7294.   Any attempt to accept a resource offer that is based on unreserved resources will fail, because Flink (as of FLINK-7294) erroneously insists that the resource come from a prior reservation.

Looking at the original issue, the problem may have been misdiagnosed.  Ideally Flink should work with both reserved and unreserved resources, but the latter is a more common situation that is now broken.
