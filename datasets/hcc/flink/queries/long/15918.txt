Description
The uptime metric is not reset when the job restarts, which is a change in behavior compared to Flink 1.8.
This change of behavior exists since 1.9.0 if jobmanager.execution.failover-strategy: region is configured,
which we do in the default flink-conf.yaml.


Workarounds
Users that find this behavior problematic can set jobmanager.scheduler: legacy and unset jobmanager.execution.failover-strategy: region in their flink-conf.yaml


How to reproduce
trivial

Expected behavior
uptime should be reset on any vertex restart.
