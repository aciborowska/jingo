The ClusterClient has a method #getJobManagerAddress which retrieves the address of the leading JobManager. In order to make this method work with Flip-6 I propose to rename it into getClusterConnectionInfo which retrieves the LeaderConnectionInfo for the leader component of the cluster. In Flip-6 this will be the Dispatcher. In the old code, this will be the JobManager.
