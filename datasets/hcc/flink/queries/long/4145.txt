I saw multiple failures of the JmxReporterTest most likely due to a port conflicts. The test relies on the default JMX reporter port range, which spans 5 ports. Running on Travis with multiple concurrent builds and bad timings, this can lead to port conflicts.

Some example failed runs:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/141999066/log.txt (one out of 5 jobs failed)

https://travis-ci.org/uce/flink/builds/141917901 (all 5 jobs failed)

I propose to take the fork number into account (like the forkable Flink testing cluster) and configure a larger port range.
