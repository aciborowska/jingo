Some demo In docs
 https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/dev/table/connect.html#kafka-connector are easy to misunderstand.

For example, kafka connector DDL definition should declare format.type mandatory, however, the definition part of kafka misses this.
Some users will meet a NoMatchingTableFactoryException if they follow the documentation.
There is a statement at the end of this section describe the required format properties, but that is not obvious enought.
