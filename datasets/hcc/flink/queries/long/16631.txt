More and more often I observe that Flink builds fail on Travis because of missing Flink caches:



Cached flink dir /home/travis/flink_cache/40072/flink does not exist. Exiting build.



It seems as if Travis cannot guarantee that a cache survives as long as the different profiles of a build are running. It would be good to solve this problem because now we have regularly failing builds:
