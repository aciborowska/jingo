          As the Chinese government closed its visit to Google（GFW），the drop-down menu about document on the home page （https://flink.apache.org/） doesn't work .  So  that many Chinese developers can not view the flink document if we don't use the Proxy Software，but the Proxy Software  is generally charged .So I hope you can improve it ,the Chinese developers access flink documents as access the other open source projects (for example storm ,kafka, rocketmq) don't have to use proxy software.
