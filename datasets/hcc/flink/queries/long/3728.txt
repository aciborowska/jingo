We must explicitly exclude unsupported SQL features such as Grouping Sets from being translated to Flink programs. 
Otherwise, the resulting program will compute invalid results.

For that we must restrict the Calcite rules that translate Logical RelNodes into DataSetRel or DataStreamRel nodes.
We may only translate to DataSetRel or DataStreamRel nodes if these support the semantics of the RelNode.

Not translating a RelNode will yield a Calcite CannotPlanException that we should catch and enrich with a meaningful error message.
