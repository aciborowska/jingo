FLINK-10934 introduces applicaion mode support in the native K8s setups., but as the discussion in https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/12003, there's large probability that all the K8s resources leak after the JobManager finishes except that the replica of Deployment is scaled down to 0. We need to find out the root cause and fix it.

This may be related to the way fabric8 SDK deletes a Deployment. It splits the procedure into three steps as follows:

	Scales down the replica to 0
	Wait until the scaling down succeed
	Delete the ReplicaSet
