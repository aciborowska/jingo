Currently the user cannot apply more than one transformation on the IterativeDataStream directly.

It fails because instead of creating one iteration source and connecting it to the operators it will try to create two iteration sources which fails on the shared broker slot.

A workaround is to use a no-op mapper on the iterative stream and applying the two transformations on that.
