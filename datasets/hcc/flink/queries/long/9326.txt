When attempting to set the number of task slots via the api such ash


configuration = new Configuration();
configuration.setInteger(TaskManagerOptions.NUM_TASK_SLOTS, 16);
configuration.setInteger(CoreOptions.DEFAULT_PARALLELISM, 1);


I will always end up with the default slot setting based on the number of cores I have where my standalone instance is running, it doesn't matter what I set the the NUM_TASK_SLOTS to, it has no effect
