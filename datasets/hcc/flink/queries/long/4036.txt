When the stream iteration head finishes before the iteration tail acquires the feedback queue, the tail will block indefinitely.

This happened here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/134215892/log.txt

You can provoke this by adding a sleep before acquiring the feedback queue in StreamIterationTail and running IterateTest.testSimpleIteration.
