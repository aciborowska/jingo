We have already harden the Avro Confluent Schema Registry test in FLINK-13567. However, there are still some defects in current mechanism.

	The loop variable i is not safe, it could be modified by the command.
	The process of downloading kafka 0.10 is not included in the scope of retry_times . I think we need to include it to tolerent transient network issue.



We need to fix those issue to harden the Avro Confluent Schema Registry nightly end-to-end test.
