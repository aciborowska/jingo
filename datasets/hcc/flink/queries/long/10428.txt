The AbstractServerBase, the base class of the queryable state servers, is setup to bind to the same hostname as the RpcService of the TaskExecutor. People ran into the problem that in certain setups where you start Flink components locally or in the same container, that the queryable state server binds to 127.0.0.1. Therefore it is not possible to connect from the outside to this machine.

I propose to bind per default to any hostname (0.0.0.0) and make it configurable in case that a user wants to bind to a specific hostname.
