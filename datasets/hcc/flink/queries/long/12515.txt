When we moved flink-shaded-hadoop to flink-shaded we did not account for dependencyManagement entries in the root pom which affected the versions of multiple transitive dependencies.

As a result the set of bundled dependencies has changed.
We should go over the existing dependency management entries, determine which affect the bundling of hadoop, and copy them into the respective flink-shaded-hadoop module.
