Hadoop transitively pulls the system dependency jdk:tools which is not longer available on Java 9+. This causes errors when importing the code into an IDE with runs Java 11.

This dependency is anyways not needed when running the code, because the classes are always present. It can be safely excluded form the transitive dependencies.
