The license filter isn't actually filtering anything. It should be META-INF/license/**.

The first filter seems to be outdated btw.

Multiple modules affected.



<filter>
	<artifact>io.netty:netty</artifact>
	<excludes>
		<exclude>META-INF/maven/io.netty/**</exclude>
		<!-- Only some of these licenses actually apply to the JAR and have been manually
placed in this module's resources directory. -->
		<exclude>META-INF/license</exclude>
		<!-- Only parts of NOTICE file actually apply to the netty JAR and have been manually
copied into this modules's NOTICE file. -->
		<exclude>META-INF/NOTICE.txt</exclude>
	</excludes>
</filter>
