tools/generate_specific_pom.sh expects the parent module information of poms to match the order 


<groupId>..</groupId><artifactId>..</artifactId><version>..</version>



However, Maven doesn't enforce any order on these xml tags.

If the order does not match, the script fails to change the version information of the parent module which can lead to compilation and checkstyle errors:


"Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.12.1:check (validate) on project flink-language-binding-generic: Failed during checkstyle execution: Unable to find suppressions file at location: /tools/maven/suppressions.xml: Could not find resource '/tools/maven/suppressions.xml'."



Fixes like 7984acc are necessary to compensate for the script's behavior.
