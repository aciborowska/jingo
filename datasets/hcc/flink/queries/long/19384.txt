The methods in org.apache.flink.api.connector.source.Source have inconsistent exception signatures:

	the methods to create reader and enumerator do not throw a checked exception
	the method to restore an enumerator throws an IOException.



Either all methods should allow throwing checked IOExceptions or all methods should not allo any checked exceptions.
