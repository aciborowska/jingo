The test `testMap` in `HiveGenericUDFTest` may fail due if HashMap iterates in a different order. `testMap` depends on `getConversion` and `toFlinkObject` in class `MapObjectInspector`. When the `inspector` is the instance of `MapObjectInspector`, it can return a `HashMap`. However, `HashMap` does not guarantee any specific order of entries. Thus, the test can fail due to a different iteration order.
