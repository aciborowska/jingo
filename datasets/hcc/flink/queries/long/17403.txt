runBashJavaUtilsCmd.sh locates flink-dist.jar by `find` with pattern `flink-dist*.jar`, but it doesn't filter out the flink-dist*-source.jar built by maven and the flink-dist jar in the original bin directory, so it might get 3 jars as the result, which might break the command depends on it.

For instance, the result of `find` can be:
```
project_dir/flink-dist/src/test/bin/../../../target/flink-dist_2.11-1.10.0-sources.jar
project_dir/flink-dist/src/test/bin/../../../target/flink-1.10.0-bin/flink-1.10.0/lib/flink-dist_2.11-1.10.0.jar
project_dirflink-dist/src/test/bin/../../../target/flink-dist_2.11-1.10.0.jar
```

Moreover, there's a redundant `}` in the command, which seems to be accidentally skipped by the multiple-line result provided by `find`.
