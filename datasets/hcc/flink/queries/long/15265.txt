The executor names always have "-executor" as a suffix, this is reduntant. Currently, the executor name is also used to retrieve a ClusterClient, where it is unfortunate that the name has executor as a suffix. In the future we might provide something like a FlinkClient that offers a programmatic API for the functionality of bin/flink, here we would also use the same names.

In reality, the "executor names" are not names of executors but deployment targets. That's why the current naming seems a bit unnatural.

This is a simple search-and-replace job, no new functionality.
