The quickstart's add-dependencies-for-IDEA profile (for including flink-runtime and further dependencies that are usually provided) is not automatically enabled with IntelliJ anymore since the idea.version property is not set anymore (since a couple of versions of IntelliJ). My IntelliJ, for example, sets idea.version2019.3 instead but even if the profile activation is changed to that, it is not enabled by default by IntelliJ.

There are two workarounds:

	Tick Include dependencies with "Provided" scope in the run configuration (available in any newer IntelliJ version, probably since 2018) or
	enable the profile manually - downside: if you create a jar inside IntelliJ via its own maven targets, the jar would contain the provided dependencies and make it unsuitable for submission into a Flink cluster.



I propose to remove the add-dependencies-for-IDEA profile for good (from the quickstarts) and adapt the documentation accordingly, e.g. https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/projectsetup/dependencies.html#setting-up-a-project-basic-dependencies
