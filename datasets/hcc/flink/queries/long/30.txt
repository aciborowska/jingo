The commons-lang and commons-configuration are missing from the classpath. 

In particular, commons-configuration is required by hadoop-core and thereby by pact-runtime, while commons-lang is required by commons-configuration.

In order to solve the issue the appropriate lines for including commons-configuration and commons-lang to the classpath should be added to pact-client.sh, nephele-jobmanager.sh and nephele-taskmanager.sh (not sure about the last two).
