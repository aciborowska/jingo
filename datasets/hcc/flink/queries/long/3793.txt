Now that we have added SQL and soon streaming SQL support, we need to reorganize the Table API documentation. 

	The current guide is under "apis/batch/libs". We should either split it into a streaming and a batch part or move it to under "apis". The second option might be preferable, as the batch and stream APIs have a lot in common.
	The current guide has separate sections for Java and Scala APIs. These can be merged and organized with tabs, like other parts of the docs.
	Mentions of "Table API" can be renamed to "Table API and SQL", e.g. in the software stack figure and homepage.
