In bin/config.sh rotateLogFilesWithPrefix(),it use extended regular to process filename with "sed -E",but when sed version is below 4.2,it turns out "sed: invalid option â€“ 'E'"

and RotateLogFile won't work well : There will be only one logfile no matter what is $MAX_LOG_FILE_NUMBER.


so use sed -r may be more suitable.
