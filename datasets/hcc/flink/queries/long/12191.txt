Like FLINK-11043, the Flink SVGs on the Material page of the Flink website are invalid and do not render correctly on Firefox.

I'm not sure if there is an additional source-of-truth for these images, or if these hosted on the website are canonical, but I can fix them nonetheless.

I also noticed that one of the squirrels in both color_black.svg and color_white.svg is missing the eye gradient, which can also be easily fixed.
