Flink (or some of its services) listens on three random TCP ports
during the local[1] execution, e.g., 39951, 41009 and 42849.

The sockets listens on `0.0.0.0` and since I need to run some
long-running tests on an Internet-facing machine I was wondering how
to make them listen on `localhost` instead or if there is anything
else I can do to improve the security in this scenario.

Here's what I tried (with little luck):

```
Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.setString("taskmanager.host", "127.0.0.1");
cconfig.setString("rest.bind-address", "127.0.0.1"); // OK
config.setString("jobmanager.rpc.address", "127.0.0.1");
StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.createLocalEnvironment(StreamExecutionEnvironment.getDefaultLocalParallelism(), config);
```

Only the `rest.bind-address` configuration actually changes the
binding address of one of those ports. Are there other parameters that
I'm not aware of or this is not the right approach in local mode?
