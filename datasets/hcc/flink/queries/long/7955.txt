The following query fails with a NullPointerException:



val windowedTable = table
      .window(Tumble over 5.milli on 'rowtime as 'w)
      .groupBy('w, 'word)
      .select('word, 'rowtime.count, 'w.start, 'w.end)



Equivalent SQL queries or Table API queries that use a processing time attribute are working.
