This page https://flink.apache.org/features.html shows the code which implements PageRank algorithm (Batch Processing Applications).

I noticed couple bugs in the code
Page class has pageId field
Adjacency has just id

but in the code I see

pages.join(adjacency).where("pageId").equalTo("pageId")



Page(page.id, 0.15 / numPages)


Also, the code in not formatted (missing spaces)

Page(n, 0.85*page.rank/adj.neighbors.length)
