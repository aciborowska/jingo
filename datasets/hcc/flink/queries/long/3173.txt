Currently, the TwitterStream example is not working with the TwitterSource, because we're using httpclient version 4.2. There seems to be bug in the httpclient which causes the connection to the Twitter stream to fail. With version 4.2.6 this issue is fixed. I propose, therefore, to bump the version to 4.2.6.
