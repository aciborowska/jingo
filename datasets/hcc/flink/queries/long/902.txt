Hi,

I integrated the webclient ((#711 | FLINK-711)) into the old infrastructure. You should be able to use it like you are used too (upload jars, etc.).

Start the client with bin/start-webclient.sh and navigate to localhost:8080 to test it out. If you want to run a job you should also do bin/start-local.sh .
