I tried the run the quickstart KMeans example with the new example program and followed the instructions on the website.

I had to adapt the Python script and the data generation command, but when I tried to submit the job on the webclient, I got this error message:

```
Unknown local strategy 'SORTED_PARTIAL_REDUCE' in JSON generator.
```
