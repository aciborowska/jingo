Calling ./bin/pyflink3.sh will lead to


./bin/pyflink3.sh
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.hadoop.metrics2.lib.MutableMetricsFactory).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
log4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.
JAR file does not exist: /home/robert/incubator-flink/build-target/bin/../lib/flink-python-0.9-SNAPSHOT.jar

Use the help option (-h or --help) to get help on the command.



This is due to the script expecting a flink-python-0.9-SNAPSHOT.jar file to exist in lib (its wrong anyways that the version name is included here. That should be replaced by a *).

I'll look into the issue ...
