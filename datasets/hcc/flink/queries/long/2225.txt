While running the ConnectedComponents example on a testing cluster, I encountered spurious failures of the job execution. The error was that the scheduler could sometimes not schedule co-located tasks because it did not find any suitable slots for deployment. 

This error might be related to FLINK-1952 where a similar error was observed. The error might have been reintroduced by FLINK-2183 which fixed another scheduling error.
