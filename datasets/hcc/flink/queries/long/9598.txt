We have set the config Minimum Pause Between Checkpoints to be 10 min but noticed that when a checkpoint fails (because it timesout before it completes) the application immediately starts taking the next checkpoint. This basically stalls the application's progress since its always taking checkpoints.

Screen Shot 2018-06-20 at 7.44.10 AM.png is a screenshot of this issue.

Details:

	Running Flink-1.3.2 on EMR
	checkpoint timeout duration: 40 min
	minimum pause between checkpoints: 10 min



There is also a relevant thread that I found on the Flink users group.
