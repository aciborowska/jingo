I am now trying to deploy Flink-1.3-Snapshot on Openshift which is a docker-environment. I was able to successfully deploy Flink-1.1.2 version on Openshift although I encountered the exception that "org.apache.flink.runtime.util.EnvironmentInformation          - Error while accessing user/group information via Hadoop utils.java.io.IOException: failure to login", this exception was handled and finally the jobmanager can be fired up on Openshift.

However when it comes 1.3-SNAPSHOT, it will finally incur the error that "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: unable to establish the security context" which is caused by "Caused by: javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: java.lang.NullPointerException: invalid null input: name", then the Jobmanager failed to start. The reason looks like is that containers run on openshift are assigned a random uid rather than running as the default uid declared by the image. this can cause problems for some images. So for the container it does not have a current user name, however due to some reason in Flink 1.3-SNAPSHOT Hadoop needs to extract the user name from UNIX, if null it will throw an exception and stop firing up.
