There are some heap dump files in the user account in which stratosphere is running. For example one file "core.20140215.013348.204064.0001.dmp" is taking 21G and another 26G. No tmp directory is specified in stratosphere configuration file and $TMPDIR is empty. Does this mean that stratosphere starts using home directory as tmp directory instead of /tmp directory?
Who is supposed to clean the directory?
