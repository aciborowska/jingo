DescriptiveStatisticsHistogram#getCount() returns the number of elements in the current window and not the number of total elements seen over time. In contrast, DropwizardHistogramWrapper does this correctly.

We should unify the behaviour and add a unit test for it (there is no generic histogram test yet).
