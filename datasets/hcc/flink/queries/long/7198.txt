When using the Datadog Metric Reporter with a Mesos deployed Flink 1.3.1 cluster the JobManager is reported to Datadog with a tag of host:127.0.0.1. The TaskManagers report with the correct tag (i.e. host:mesos-02.place.com), so this just appears to be an issue with the way host information is gathered for Datadog.
