The SQL Client does not properly return the hints for commands such as:

USE CATALOG,
SHOW CATALOGS,
SHOW MODULES

Or whenever it does not actually fall back to the table planner.

The reason being is that the hint returned does not take into account the current cursor position but returns the complete text.
