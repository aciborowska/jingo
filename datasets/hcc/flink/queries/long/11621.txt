Hi, there!

    We are a research team working on third-party library analysis. We have found that some widely-used third-party libraries in your project have major/critical bugs, which will degrade the quality of your project. We highly recommend you to update those libraries to new versions.

    We have attached the buggy third-party libraries and corresponding jira issue links below for you to have more detailed information.
