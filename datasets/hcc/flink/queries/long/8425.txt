It seems like SpilledSubpartitionView is not protected against concurrently calling releaseAllResources as the other ResultSubpartitionView implementations. These may happen due to failures, e.g. network channels breaking, and will probably only result in some unexpected exceptions being thrown, e.g. from reading from a closed file reader.
