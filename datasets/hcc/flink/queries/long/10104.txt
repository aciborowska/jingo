Following a discussion on another topic with Gary Yao ( http://apache-flink-user-mailing-list-archive.2336050.n4.nabble.com/Could-not-build-the-program-from-JAR-file-td22102.html )

It seems that there is a bug as my job is very slow to start.

I am using Flink to process messages from an input topic, and to redirect them to two output topics, and when I start the job, I have to wait between 5 and 10 minutes before I get anything into the output topic. With version 1.4.2, it was much faster.

I run the job on Yarn, and, as asked by Gary, I attached the results of yarn logs -applicationId <appId>

 

Also, as you can notice from the logs, the reported version is 0.1 Rev:1a9b648. I have no clue why, as I downloaded the official Flink 1.5.2 distribution
