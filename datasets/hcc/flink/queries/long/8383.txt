The build for flink-mesos is failing with:


[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-shade-plugin:3.0.0:shade (shade-flink) on project flink-mesos_2.11: Error creating shaded jar: duplicate entry: META-INF/services/org.apache.flink.mesos.shaded.com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonFactory -> [Help 1]



Seems to be caused by https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/9ae4c5447a2f5aae2b65d5860f822d452a9d5af1.
