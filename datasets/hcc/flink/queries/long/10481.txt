The Wordcount end-to-end test in docker env fails sometimes on Travis with the following problem:

It seems as if it is related to https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/264 and https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/279.

We might want to switch to a different base image to avoid these problems in the future.
