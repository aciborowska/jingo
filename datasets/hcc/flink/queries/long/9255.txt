Every time the flink CLI is called with the -m option to specify the jobmanager address, the CLI is stuck on "Waiting for response..." and the Jobmanager reports the following error:

WARN akka.remote.transport.netty.NettyTransport - Remote connection to [/x.x.x.x:xxxx] failed with org.apache.flink.shaded.akka.org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.frame.TooLongFrameException: Adjusted frame length exceeds 10485760: 1195725860 - discarded

The error occurs even when run locally and try something like "flink list -m localhost:6123". But "flink list" works as expected.

I'm using the version from the "release-1.5" branch.

It seems like the commit introducing the regression is 47909f4
