I start flink as local cluster.

$ tar xzf flink-*.tgz
$ cd flink-1.6.1
$ ./bin/start-cluster.sh  # Start Flink

I createRemoteEnvironment to submit a remote job and job run successful.

However when I read stdout log from web ui, I find nothing. And can see job manager logs.
I can find logs on linux server.
