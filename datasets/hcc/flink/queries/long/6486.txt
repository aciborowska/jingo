For now CodeGenerator only processes Row type, so we should pass RowTypeInfo to CodeGenerator instead of CRowTypeInfo. We can find these bugs in DataStreamGroupAggregate, DataStreamGroupWindowAggregate and DataStreamOverAggregate. These bugs will bring no error to the current flink because no code will make use of the error input type, however we should correct it.
