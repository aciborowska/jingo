The job exceptions page in the WebFrontend is currently broken, displaying (null) for every task even if no exception has occurred.

The JobExceptionsHandlers checks whether an exception has occurred, and thus displayed, by checking whether the rootException is null. This worked until recently since we worked directly on Throwables, this was jhowever changed to stringified version of the exceptions. This had the side-effect that the exception is now never null, but "(null)", leading the handler to believe that an exception has occurred.

The checks should be changed to 

!exception.equals("(null)")
