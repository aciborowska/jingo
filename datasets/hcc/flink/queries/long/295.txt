I have a working InputFormat + testcase for the libsvm format (initial version is from Ufuk). Does it make sense to add this to stratosphere-addon (#199 | FLINK-199) ?
Or will we have separate ML-specific repo?

Libsvm is a common file format for machine learning (mostly supervised), and there is a huge [library|http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/) of datasets in libsvm format available.

The input format reads a file in the libsvm format (either multi-label or single-label), and emits a mahout vector. The vector is wrapped in a PactVector class (implements Value), which is a copy of VectorWritable from mahout (needed to create a copy and change the function names, since we don't support Writable yet].

Code:
LibsvmInputFormat
Test case
[Pact vector|https://github.com/andrehacker/logreg/blob/master/logreg-pact/src/main/java/de/tuberlin/dima/ml/pact/types/PactVector.java)

This has some implications

	we need to add a dependency to mahout to stratosphere-addons (which version?)
	we need to make a copy of any version of VectorWritable and add this to our code. (Is this allowed? Which version?]
