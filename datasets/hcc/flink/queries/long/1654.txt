In documentation, there is a scala example of POJO


class WordWithCount(val word: String, val count: Int) {
  def this() {
    this(null, -1)
  }
}



I think that this is wrong because Flink POJO required public fields or private fields with getter and setter. Fields in scala class is private in default. We should change the field declarations to use `var` keyword or class declaration to case class.
