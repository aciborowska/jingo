in section "GroupCombine on a Grouped DataSet" of the following link: https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.0/apis/batch/dataset_transformations.html#groupreduce-on-grouped-dataset
there is a little mistake in java code in both combine and reduce method(it's the same mistake). The variable "word" is defined in the scope of the for loop so it cannot be used in collect method.
Possible solution could be to initialise the variable before the for and assign a value inside the for.
Something like:

int count = 0;
String word;
for (String record : words) {
    word = record;
    count++;
}
out.collect(new Tuple2(word, count));
