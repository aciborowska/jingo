The tests for the storm compatibiliy layer are all working with timeouts (running the program for 10 seconds) and then checking whether teh expected result has been written.

That is inherently unstable and slow (long delays). They should be rewritten in a similar manner like for example the KafkaITCase tests, where the streaming jobs terminate themselves with a "SuccessException", which can be recognized as successful completion when thrown by the job client.
