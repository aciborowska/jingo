When some sources exit early, the barrier buffer may start an alignment, but will never complete it, because some inputs never deliver a checkpoint barrier.

FLINK-2515 mitigates most of the problem, by not starting checkpoints any more when some sources already finished. When a checkpoint is started while a source is finishing, the barrier buffer may still align infinitely.
