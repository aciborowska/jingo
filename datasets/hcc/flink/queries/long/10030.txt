flink 1.5 with zk ha mode,when a job is cancelled,if you restart the cluster,the jobmanager will fail because of missing the blob data. I find thatÂ  the information about the job in zk node jobgraphs cannot be removed due to the standby jobmanager lock the node.I think that standby jobmanager should not be watch the jobgraphs node.
