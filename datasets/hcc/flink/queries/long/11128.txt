Source with push-down are part of public API: https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/table/sourceSinks.html#defining-a-tablesource-with-filter-push-down

 

But all methods of org.apache.flink.table.expressions.Expression are private[flink], what makes it impossible to use.

 

Please, change private[flink] to public.
