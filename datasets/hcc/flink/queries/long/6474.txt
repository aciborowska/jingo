In TaskManagerServicesConfiguration#parseNetworkEnvironmentConfiguration

    if (!hasNewNetworkBufConf(configuration)) {
      // map old config to new one:
      networkBufMin = networkBufMax = numNetworkBuffers * pageSize;


networkBufMax is a long.
However the multiplication is done in 32 bit integer, leading to potential loss of precision.
