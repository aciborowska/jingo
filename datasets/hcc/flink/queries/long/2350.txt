The stream open requests have the ability to fail after a certain timeout. By default, this timeout is deactivated, because loaded HDFS has in the past frequently exceeded this timeout.

I think no one ever used this, and I am not sure it is useful, actually. We can remove it to reduce code complexity, in my opinion.
