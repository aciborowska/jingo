Configuring obscenely large amounts of memory that exceed the machine, which prevents the JVM startup, does not result in any error to be printed to the console. The logs are empty, and the only hint for an error is found in the .out file.



OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: INFO: os::commit_memory(0x00007aaf70000000, 5241403604992, 0) failed; error='Not enough space' (errno=12)
#
# There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.
# Native memory allocation (mmap) failed to map 5241403604992 bytes for committing reserved memory.



This behavior is just a bit too subtle.
