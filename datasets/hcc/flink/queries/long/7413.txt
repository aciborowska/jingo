At least one user on the mailing lists had an issue because Hadoop 2.8.x binaries are not available: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/c8badc66778144d9d6c3ee5cb23dd732a66cb6690c6867f47f4bd456@%3Cuser.flink.apache.org%3E

It should be as easy as adding Hadoop 2.8.x to the list of created binaries in the release files.
