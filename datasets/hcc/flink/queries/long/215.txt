I guess introduced by https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/pull/195

Calling Wordcount without any arguments causes a NPE.

Calling it with the correct arguments (`2  hdfs:///user/robert/datasets/hamlet-wc hdfs:///tmp/stratosphere-dev/wc`)

Causes this 
```
Could not find or load main class 2
```
No stacktrace.
