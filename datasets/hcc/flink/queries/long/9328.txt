Currently, StateBackendTestBase class does not register snapshots to SharedStateRegistry in testValueState, testListState, testReducingState, testFoldingState and testMapState UTs, which may cause RocksDBStateBackend to restore from PlaceholderStreamStateHandle during the 2nd restore procedure if one specific sst file both existed in the 1st snapshot and the 2nd snapshot handle.
