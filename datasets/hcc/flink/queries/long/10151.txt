TransformingStateTableKeyGroupPartitioner currently calls tryAddToSource recursively but has to call the super method of extended StateTableKeyGroupPartitioner. It can lead to infinite recursion when full snapshot cleanup strategy is activated for heap backend in async snapshot mode. The HeapTtlStateTest should be also divided into sync and async mode test suites to catch the problem.
