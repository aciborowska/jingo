The steps are the following(copied from Stephan's comments in 5931):


	JobMaster / SlotPool requests a slot (AllocationID) from the ResourceManager
	ResourceManager starts a container with a TaskManager
	TaskManager registers at ResourceManager, which tells the TaskManager to push a slot to the JobManager.
	TaskManager container is killed
	The ResourceManager does not queue back the slot requests (AllocationIDs) that it sent to the previous TaskManager, so the requests are lost and need to time out before another attempt is tried.
