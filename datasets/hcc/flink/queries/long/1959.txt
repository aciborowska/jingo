while running the Accumulator example in https://github.com/Elbehery/flink/blob/master/flink-examples/flink-java-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/examples/java/relational/EmptyFieldsCountAccumulator.java, 

I tried to alter the data flow with "PartitionByHash" function before applying "Filter", and the resulted accumulator was NULL. 

By Debugging, I could see the accumulator in the RunTime Map. However, by retrieving the accumulator from the JobExecutionResult object, it was NULL. 


The line caused the problem is "file.partitionByHash(1).filter(new EmptyFieldFilter())" instead of "file.filter(new EmptyFieldFilter())"
