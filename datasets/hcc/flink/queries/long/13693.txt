Fully qualified paths and backtick quoted identifiers are not supported in some DDLs while they're supported in queries. For example:

Flink SQL> describe `default`.tbl;
[ERROR] Could not execute SQL statement. Reason:
org.apache.flink.table.api.ValidationException: Table '`default`.tbl' was not found.



One solution is to make all DDLs go through the parser in order to get the identifiers right.
