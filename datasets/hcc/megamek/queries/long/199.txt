Not sure if this is a megamek or mekhq issue, but i saw a previous ticket about ejected vehicle crews here : https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/issues/31

I had forced withdrawal on and after ejecting a von luckner, the crew was considered killed in mekHQ. Not sure if thats because megamek is telling mekhq that the crew is dead or mekhq is reading the data incorrectly.

Player name was "My Campaign"
