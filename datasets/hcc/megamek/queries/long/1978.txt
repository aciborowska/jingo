### Environment
Testing on MM46.1

### Description
Place a mech in a hex with a Vibrabomb, or use Thunder Vibrabombs to deploy a minefield in the mechs hex.  Set the vibrabomb to have a detection threshold of 20, so it will activate.

Move the mech out of the vibrabomb minefield.  The mech will take damage.

This is incorrect.

There are several places in tactical operations where it is stated that a unit leaving a hex that is mined does not set off the mines.  For example on pg 373

In addition the example for Vibrabomb mine usage on pg 209 says that the check to see if the vibramine activates happens when a mech enters a hex.

Since in my example above the mech that is activating the mines is the one that just entered another hex entirely, it can not be in the hex it just left to be hit by the mines.
