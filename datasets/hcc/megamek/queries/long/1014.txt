### Description
So this is what the tooltip states for the field of view overlay:

I want to stay out of that Warhammer's LOS until I can get behind it with the panther.  So, if I move three hexes forward the WH's LOS should be blocked to my panther as the overlay is showing.

But if I then change my facing to South the WH can see me all of a sudden??? Facing should not effect other unit's LOS to my unit unless this overlay is not coded to do what I am assuming it does showing what hexes' LOS are blocked to the hex I want to move into.

*** Am having to type /save DFOV twice to get megamek to actually save the game.  The first command just gets sent through as a chat so, something is screwy with the chat commands again as well.
