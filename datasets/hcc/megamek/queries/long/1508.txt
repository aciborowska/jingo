### Environment
MegaMek v0.46.0

### Description
Supposedly #1259 was fixed in 0.45.4 with #1261. Our play group only recently used the new stable version of MegaMek and were surprised to find that ETT for quads was still not working. Looking at megamek/common/QuadMech.java, the fix was never merged with the master somehow.
