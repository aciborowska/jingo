When deploying a unit next to another unit in the deployment phase, the first unit's image/hp bars/direction arrow frequently gets displayed to another hex like in the screenshot below. This is a graphics glitch that only occurs in the deployment phase, once the game starts, the units will all be in the correct position with no other problems.
