Okay couldn't find an open issue on this so here it is. In isometric view and with different height hexes (try it out in a hills map) the aero path line is wonky... Basically it doesn't quite correlate to the actual path taken, or more properly it does't "look" like it does.
Hope this helps. Somehow...
