
I put a similar issue in for MML, but when I hand-edited an MTF with Harjel III in the head, Megamek labels it as invalid. It will still function, but the flag is, as far as I can tell, erroneous. Nothing in the rules or errata for Harjel II or III says that they are restricted from the cockpit location. I can find that for the original Tacops Harjel system but nothing for the II or III.
