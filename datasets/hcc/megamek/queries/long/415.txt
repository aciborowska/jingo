Hover vees cannot pass over submerged woods hexes when the depth of water exceeeds the height of the woods. In this image I have depth 3 water over woods, which will give a clearance of 1 elevation. However, the hover apc is still prohibited. 

I have not checked yet, but this may also apply to watercraft & submarines.
