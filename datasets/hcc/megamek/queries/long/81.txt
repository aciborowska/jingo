## NOTE:  The attached save was played on a map with custom tilesets; the map may not be visible without these files.

During a match, an Archer was grappling a Jagermech, and in the process, destroyed it's arms (while losing one of it's own arms).  The grapple continued until a second unit fired into the melee to attack the Jagermech, hitting it's gyro repeatedly and knocking it down.

On the Jagermech's turn, the game hung and refused to progress past this point.  I believe the primary cause was being knocked during during a grapple but there were numerous factors at work (as mentioned above).   

Additional Issue:  The Archer took no penalty to maintain the grapple after losing an arm.  I am unsure if it is related.
