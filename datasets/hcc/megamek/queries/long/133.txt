Was looking to get the message when trying to attack more than one target, but my targets were all in buildings. When I attacked the second building I received no message and was able to continue the second attack. I tested this a second time using nose, RW, and LW on separate targets and was able to attack 3 buildings with a loss of a single altitude. All hexes were adjacent.
