I'm currently playing on a 1.1 G world... wanted to double check the PSRs for Hi-G fighting and found this...

TO Errata
Under “Potential Damage From Jumping”, first sentence
“Make a Piloting Skill Roll, adding the appropriate modifiers for low gravity; a standard Piloting Skill Roll is made in high gravity, with no modifiers.”
Change to:
“**Make a standard Piloting Skill Roll, applying a modifier for every full 0.5 gravities above or below 1. For example .2 would apply a +1 modifier, while a 2.6 would apply a +3 modifier.**”

There should be no G penalty at 1.1 Gs.
