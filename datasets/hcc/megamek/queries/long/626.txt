Player BV is calculated during the exchange phase and never updated.  That means, if a player reinforces, their BV total doesn't update and could potentially go over 100%.  I could see this being useful in rare circumstances, but generally isn't what is wanted.  Particularly, this could affect BV victory conditions.  Generally, I would assume that reinforcements would prevent the side from losing, but don't currently.
