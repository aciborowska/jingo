I have a unit that's refusing to deploy properly? Or something just finished repairing it today (mostly, still need a heat sink delivered ...) it shows up in the proper lance in the ToE, and in the table of deployed units in the Briefing Room screen, and in the Megamek lobby when I Start Game

but then when I actually enter the game it's not there
