Currently when a player types in a theme for a board or when snowcapped mountains are used and such a theme does not exist MM will go into the StandardThemes.tileinc and use the first theme listed in place of the request theme that does not exist.
# The Standard MM themes

include "lunar/ThemeLunar.tileinc"    <Is what MM will use for non-existent themes
include "mars/ThemeMars.tileinc"
include "volcano/ThemeVolcano.tileinc"
include "grass/ThemeGrass.tileinc"
include "volcano/ThemeVolcano.tileinc"

Discussed with Arlith that maybe it would be better if MM instead ignored the request for a non-existent theme and just used the blank/no theme for the current tileset.
