An Aerodyne DS can not drop units on the ground map if they move. The Units simply will not exit. The only way to get the units to drop is to not move the Aerodyne DS and let it stall for PSR.

See attached Save for quick reproduction. No errors in Log.

Fix? Aerodyne's drop units at the end of their turn? Or the beginning? Or in order of the commands clicked? Drop Troops then Move, vice versa.
