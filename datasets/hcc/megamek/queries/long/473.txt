Weapons fire for Hunchback HBK-4H (Independent (Periphery))
    AC/10 at Peregrine Attack VTOL (FCE) #2 (Comguards); needs 7, rolls 12 : hits  (using Right Side table) RS
        Peregrine Attack VTOL (FCE) #2 (Comguards) takes 10 damage to RS.
            Armor destroyed.
             2 Internal Structure remaining.
            Critical hit on RS. Roll is 8; damage threshold not exceeded, no effect.

The VTOLs have 9 side armor and the game has the vehicle damage threshold divisor set to 10, yet megamek thinks that the damage threshold has not been exceeded, when it has.
