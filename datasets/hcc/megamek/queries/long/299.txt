I'd like to request a small addition to Princess in order to improve playability a bit.

During an AtB scenario against Princess I came into a situation in which I immobilised an enemy BA transport vehicle which was loaded with a point of Elementals. In the next round Megamek stopped with the message "Please wait for another player to unload their stranded units" and Princess did not react. I fixed the issue by connecting as computer player and answering the pop-up window, which asked whether I wanted to unload these units or not, for Princess. It would be very helpful if Princess were able to select "Yes" to this question itself.
