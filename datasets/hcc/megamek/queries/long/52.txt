Started a new AtB scenario with a pair of aero I used in the previous. Previous scenario I added bombs in the lobby and ended the game with a few left. Didn't even think about it and started up the new scenario. MM loads up the group of mechs fine but glitched when it hit the aero.

Tried to reload the scenario w/o the bombs but got the same result. This time the UI did not glitch though and was able to display all units except the aero.

Restarted HQ, no bombs on aero, restarted scenario. No issues with either aero.
