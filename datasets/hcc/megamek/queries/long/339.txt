The bonus for init streak compensation doesn't carry over into the re-rolls. 

Example: Player A has lost init for 3 turns and has a +2. Player A rolls a 6 (+2) for an 8. Player B rolls a straight 8. They re-roll. Player A rolls a 8, Player B rolls a 10.

In this case, the 8 should get the +2 for a second tie, but does not.
