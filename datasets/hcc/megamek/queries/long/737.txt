According to CamOps and the tooltip, Oblique attacker should allow indirect fire without a spotter or LOS. In my testing, I set up two mechs with LRM launchers (with Friendly Fire on) and placed them where they had no LOS on each other. Both pilots had Oblique attacker but could not target each other with indirect fire. However, with a spotter, they were able to target each other with the -1 to hit bonus.
