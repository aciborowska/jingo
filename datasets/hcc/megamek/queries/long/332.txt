I'm not sure if this is a bug, or a cool little feature.

I was playing a game tonight where both myself, and my opponent had aerospace fighters in play on a ground map. He had me dead to rights, with two fighters directly behind mine, but his attacks vanished into the ether, hitting nothing. I don't think they were even displayed. 

During that same attack, rather than fire my rear laser, I choose to dive bomb his mech instead which I had over flown.

I think the reason his attacks disappeared was because by dive bombing, I changed my altitude from 5, to 3, during the weapons resolution phase. So, during the targeting phase, he was still able to assign attacks, but during the resolution phase, MM saw the changed altitude, and created a 2 hex deadzone around my fighter.

I think this is really cool, and kind of want it to stay in so your fighters can "hit the deck" to escape an attack, but it might be a bug. Save games attached.
