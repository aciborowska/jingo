Based on the strafing rules (TW p243), flamers should be able to be used in strafing attacks because they are direct-fire energy weapons.

Flamers currently can't be used in strafing attacks in Megamek because Flamer weapons aren't flagged as F_DIRECT_FIRE and the F_DIRECT_FIRE flag is required for a weapon to be used in a strafing attack.
