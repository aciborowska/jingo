There seems to be some inconsistency in how Tandem Charge SRM ammo operates. It should be getting a penalized critical chance on every hit instance, but this is not consistently applied to every TC SRM hit.

As you can see in the above log, the Warhammer's Tandem Charge SRM strikes get the proper crit chances. the Timber Wolf's hit log does not report any chances at a critical hit.

When I advance the test game a turn, and make them fire on each other again, both got their proper chance at critical hits.
