Turn 1 : The selected VTOL is at elevation 5 and Megamek will not let me move it into the same hex as two other VTOLs even though the VTOL would be at elevation 6 and there would be no issues with the stacking limit (max of 2 VTOLs per elevation)

Turn 2 : The selected VTOL is now at elevation 6, and Megamek will let me move it into the same hex as the other two VTOLs,

In terms of VTOL stacking limit, it seems Megamek looks at the elevation of the VTOL at the start of the turn and ignores any elevation changes it would undergo during the course of the movement.

You should be able to replicate this by adding a bunch of random VTOLs in the lobby on any map.
