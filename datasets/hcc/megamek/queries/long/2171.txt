In the Lobby, create a bot player.
Assign some 'meks to that bot player.
Then, in the player list on the left, right-click the bot player and click 'Bot Settings...' to amend the bot.
It is possible to change the bot name at this point, but if you do so and click [Okay], the bot will become unselectable (cannot change team or start point, nor edit 'Bot Settings...'), and any units that have been allocated to that bot will be locked to that phantom bot, and cannot be transferred to another player.

(Does this mean that the player name is used as an ID key value, rather than simply being a label attached to a hidden player ID?)
