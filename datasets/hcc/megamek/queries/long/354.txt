I got this report from MM recently when I attacked an infantry platoon with AC2s in Rapid Fire mode from a Jagermech, while using increased the IS AC Damage option. I'm not sure why it reported back as a pulse weapon.

I don't have a save game unfortunately. I don't think I had paranoid autosave turned on.
