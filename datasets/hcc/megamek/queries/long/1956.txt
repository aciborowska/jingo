### Environment
MM47.6

### Description
VTOL BA with Bomb racks.

Flying over a building.  Attempt to use the bomb rack attack.   Get the "Must be 1 level above the ground" message.

Place the BA 1 level above the ground.  In the building. Bomb rack attack.  The game says you must be at least at elevation 1.

Asked the BT rules questions Forum if flying 1 level above a building counts as being 1 level above the ground for purposes of the bomb rack attack.  They said yes.

Thus it is supposed to be possible for bomb rack BA to use their bomb racks against a building if they are 1 elevation above the top level of the building.



In a completely unrelated note, because I can not think of a way it would ever really matter.  VTOL BA flying above a building have to roll to hit with normal weapons.  If they are in the hex next to the building its an auto hit.
