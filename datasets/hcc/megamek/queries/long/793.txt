I've amassed a good number of maps over the years, and the 43.x branch is refusing to load a number of them. I've had this problem in 43.1, 43.2 and more recently, Bloodwolf's unofficial 43.5 beta. All of these boards work fine in 41.25

the client log spits out "Error reading board, data invalid." when I try to select the board, and when I load it in the editor, it warns me that the map has errors. Doesn't say what the errors ARE, or how to fix them. 

Attached, is one of many boards that generates the error.
