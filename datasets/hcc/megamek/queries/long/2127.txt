Version 47.8

The to-hit values for many (but not all) physical weapons are incorrect. As it stands:

-The Lance suffers from a +1 to-hit penalty instead of simply being the 'Mech's piloting value.
-The Sword suffers from a +2 to-hit penalty instead of gaining a -2 to-hit bonus.
-The Retractable Blade suffers from a +2 to-hit penalty instead of gaining a -2 to-hit bonus.
-The Hatchet suffers from a +1 to-hit penalty instead of gaining a -1 to-hit bonus.
-The Mining Drill suffers from a +1 to-hit penalty instead of gaining a -1 to-hit bonus.
