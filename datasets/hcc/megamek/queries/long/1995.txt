Standalone MM 0.46.1 running on Win10

On this version of MegaMek, it appears impossible to deploy a hidden 'mech in water - the pop-up "cannot deploy in this hex" appears.
As per Total Warfare p259, it should be possible to deploy a hidden unit in water, as long as the water is deep enough to fully submerge the unit.
