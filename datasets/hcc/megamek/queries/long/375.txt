HQ0.41.25 I setup a scenario and then saved just as a precaution because Im worried about if the resolution bug is fixed in 0.41.25 which Im about to test. I screwed up and forgot to give the opfor turrets so /reset. Then /load ERB and it set the opfor as a ghost. File>replace players was greyed out, Added a 3rd bot and could not transfer the ghost's units over to #3. /kick 2 and it then transferred her units but, still listed Simulation[Ghost}. Could not configure any of her units. /who listed only me the player, replacePlayer 2 -b:Princess -c:SIM failed since there was no player 2.  And loading a game does not restore your planetary conditions and generated map settings that i had configured before saving.

Player name: AFFS-FSAC-2REG-2BN-ECO (sorry Arlith :P)
