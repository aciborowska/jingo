### Environment
.46.2 RC, Windows 10

### Description
Upon successfully striking a unit with a Zweihander attack making use of a hatchet, MegaMek assigns a critical roll to both arms instead of the arm where the weapon is mounted. RAW states that only unarmed Zweihander attacks making use of both hands deliver a critical roll to both arms. See below

Using a tree club, ReBlade, or any other single-handed weapon seems to yield similar results. Otherwise the SPA seems to be working as intended. Doesn't stack with Melee Master which is a blessing in disguise I think. You can also use Spot Welders for Zweihandering which is a delightful meme. Good work y'all
