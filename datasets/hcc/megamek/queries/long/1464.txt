### Environment
Stand alone MegaMek 0.47.0, running on Windows 8.1 6.3 and Java 1.8.0_191

### Description
MM appears to be calculating damage against infantry from glancing blow correctly, but not displaying it on screen - see example below. Damage applied was reduced, but the text did not explain the reduction due to Glancing Blow rule.
