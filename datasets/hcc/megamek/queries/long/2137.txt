At the end of the battle, MM asks whether I want to save the units and salvage.
I click [No].
Despite this, I can see, in my 'logs' folder, an .mul file for each bot in the battle that had any surviving forces, an .mul file for salvage, and two entitystatus .txt files (which appear to hav been generated about five minutes apart, so I would suspect that one was generated when the victory condition was confirmed, and the other when I clicked [No] to save the details.

(Not a major issue, but somewhat odd.)
