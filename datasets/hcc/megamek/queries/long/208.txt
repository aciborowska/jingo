For some reason the color changes when backing up. By default, backing up always use the yellow color (normally used for running), but when using maneveuring ace to sidestep, the color seems to change to blue.

I'm not sure if backing up should use the yellow color either since its still at walking speed, which should be blue...either way, the color change due to maneveuring ace probably shouldnt be happening.
