After an enemy archer was immobilized, my bot ally surrounded it with several vehicles with functional weapons, but all of them refused to shoot it. For the next several rounds, they just kept surrounding the archer but refused to shoot it. When the pilot woke up and tried to retreat, my bot ally kept following the archer with the vehicles, but again, refused to shoot it.
