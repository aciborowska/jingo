When using SRM Inferno rounds the infantry is not giving kill credit to the attacking unit. It is instead showing as destroyed by pilot error.
`Survivors are:
Javelin JVN-10N (test)
Pilot : Nathan Wentz [1/2]
Kills : 1


Graveyard contains:
Foot Platoon (Rifle) (Princess)
Gunnery Skill : Rita Kanavos [4]
Kills : 0
Destroyed by pilot error.

Foot Platoon (Rifle) #2 (Princess)
Gunnery Skill : Selma Miskarov [4] ( 6 hit(s)   )
Kills : 0
Destroyed by Javelin JVN-10N (test)
`

The second infantry platoon listed was killed by standard SRM rounds. Additionally I tested this with frag rounds and acid warheads, both of which showed as having the correct destroyed by assignment

No errors in the log to report. Attached save game prior to victory screen. Used 0.42.1 stable
