I noticed that in one of my games, my CPU usage was abnormally high for megamek (about 13%) even though it was my turn and the bot had finished making all of its moves.

I tried loading the save game again (without replacing the bots) and the CPU usage remained high. After fiddling with some settings, i found that turning off isometric view caused the CPU usage to drop to 0%. Turning on isometric view caused CPU usage to increase to 13% again. This only seems to happen if there are ASFs in the game.

For some reason having isometric view with ASFs seem to be causing huge CPU usage spikes even if the program is idle and there are no bots present...
