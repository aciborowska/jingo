Tree clubs are supposed to break after one use, but when a pilot has Melee Master all melee attacks are doubled. It's current bugged where it will break twice, once for each hit.

I guess the intended behaviour would be for the tree club to break after the first hit and be replaced by a punch? Or perhaps two punches because it takes two working hands to use a club.
