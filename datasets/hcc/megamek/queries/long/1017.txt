My game is max standard tech, year 3067, tech progression is off, and did not find Swarm LRMs in Total Warfare.  I generated a yr 2780 Star League unit with the RAT generator and was adjusting pilot skills to get close to the max bv and seen swarm as an ammo type for the Firefly.  I dont think swarms should be legal in standard tech and didnt see any entries in the tech progression tables in IO for swarm either.
