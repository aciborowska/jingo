Hi, I started playing Megamek this year and I want to do some contributing. I've noticed that turning off a PPC's Field Inhibitor does not remove the minimum range modifier and after firing there is no roll for explosion due to feedback. I'd like to take a shot at fixing this issue myself if someone here might be able to help me get started. I've got a science degree, so I know some coding just not Java.
