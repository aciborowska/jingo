There is a "get focus when new phase begins" option, but it doesn't stop megamek from getting focus when it is your turn to move a unit.

E.G. If player A and player B are playing, and it is now player A's turn, megamek forces the window to get focus. So if Player A has his browser up, megamek will shove the megamek screen ontop of the browser (and all other applications) every time it is his turn to move.

There doesnt appear to be a client option to disable this currently and it can get very disruptive, so an option to turn it off like the "get focus when new phase begins" would be great.
