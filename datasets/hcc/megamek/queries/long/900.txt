### Description
While I have had many battles which have included vtols and air without issue, This time around that was not the case.  While either existed on the map java would max out its resource demand and slow to such a craw as to take multiple hours to complete one turn.  Once all the air units were removed (via destruction) the game returned to running normally, until reinforcements reintroduced some onto the map, at which point the slowdown was reintroduced.  log with errors is attached.
