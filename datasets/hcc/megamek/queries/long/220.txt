The SRM carrier in this save game gets the secondary target penalty if it attempts to fire 3 SRMs at the puma and a 4th one at any other target. Page 218 tacops says that for every additional crewman above 2, the vehicle may target 1 more target without penalty. The 60 ton SRM carrier has a crew of 4, so should be able to target a total of 3 different targets with no penalty (primary target + 2 additional targets for 2 crewmembers above 2).

Megamek seems to be basing it on a total of 3 different weapons (rather than targets) though, so trying to shoot a 4th weapon at a 2nd target will trigger the secondary target penalty.
