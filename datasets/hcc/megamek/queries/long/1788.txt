Playing in a game (multiplayer, hosted online, 0.46.1) this afternoon, the host had configured the Game Options so that "skip ineligible" was on for both movement and firing. Simultaneous firing was also enabled, although movement was still as normal.
This seemed to make it impossible for him to reveal hidden units, unless the opposition triggered a point-blank attack.
Is this the case? Is this solely due to the 'skip ineligible', or would 'simultaneous firing' also have an effect?
