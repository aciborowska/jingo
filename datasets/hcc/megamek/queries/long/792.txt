I know gun emplacements are a hack right now as Arlith has stated but, until they become entities then players may run into cases where the turret can shoot them but, the player cannot shoot back and it's an invincible turret.

I use the TacOps Advanced Diagramming LOS rules (where in TO is this?  I see the dead-zone rules but nothing called "Advanced Diagramming" that isnt compatible with the dead-zone rules.) which are not broken.  That LRM turret at the top of the screen can see my superheavy mech and fire at it as it should but, my superheavy cannot target the turret and has to target the building.  Who's LOS is blocked by the terrain in front of the building that the turret is sitting on.  That tends to give players fits.
