### Environment
MegaMek 0.44.0
Java 8
Windows 8.1

### Description
BA and Infantry cannot both make an anti-mech attack and fire their weapons in the same weapon attack phase.  If the player fires their weapon first and then tries to perform a leg attack megamek correctly informs them that they cannot.

But if the player performs a leg attack first and then tries to fire their weapons megamek makes it seem like everythings ok.  Though in the attack resolution phase megamek will just skip the leg attack and only register the weapon fire.
