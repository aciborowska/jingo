### Steps to reproduce problem
I was trying this out in the latest pull from GitHub. Log is found below.
1. Start a new game.
1. Add the bot.
1. Add a unit.

1. Click drop down box to switch to adding units for the bot. And this is where the issue begins directly to the right of the drop down box.

1. Moving around the mouse in the window causes white space to cover buttons and boxes/buttons being draw in weird spots. For example:  (The lower right box scrolls as the actual one does, too.)

This makes the game unplayable. The buttons are draw correctly if the mouse is over the button but then disappears again when the mouse moves away.

### Possible ideas
 * Windows 10 is screwing with Java.
 * Nvidia is screwing with Java.
 * Swing isn't handling the combo drop down box properly when it extends outside the window frame.  

It also looks like the stuff from one window, when closed, is placed onto the window behind it, like the stuff wasn't reset or discarded.  

I'm looking for ideas or a fix for this. I haven't gotten around to trying this out on Linux, so I will.
 - [x] Test on Linux for same issue.  

P.S. I couldn't figure it out on my own so I'm looking for help.
