As mentioned in the title, princess has suddenly started taking so long to move, the game has become unplayable. This problem is recent, and i have not knowingly done anything to cause this, and i have no idea what would fix this, so hopefully somebody else will know what is wrong. i am sorry for not being able to post any more details.
