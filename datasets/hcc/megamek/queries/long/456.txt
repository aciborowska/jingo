Tested this with standard LRM carriers. If you set an ammo bin to hotload, you cannot cancel the hotloading. You get a weird message where it will say that "ammo will switch to at end of turn" (see screenshot), but next turn the ammo bin will still be hot loaded.

If you attempt to switch the ammo bin to normal ammo instead of hotloaded LRMs, it will say the same thing again but the next turn the ammo bin will still be hot loaded.
