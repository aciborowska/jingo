If you have a friendly vehicle in the same hex as a enemy mech, you get a drop down list to select which to target. The problem is that the list seems to default to the friendly vehicle (not sure how this is determined, alphabetical order maybe?), even when friendly fire is off.

You can select the friendly vehicle as the target of a melee attack, but megamek wont allow you to actually perform any melee attacks on it. With friendly fire off, when you click on a hex with an enemy mech and a friendly vehicle, megamek should automatically target the enemy mech as the friendly vehicle is an invalid target anyway.

With friendly fire on, the drop down list should default to the enemy mech instead of the friendly vehicle (as it is the more likely target).

If you want a save with an enemy mech and a friendly vehicle in the same hex within melee range, try the above save.
