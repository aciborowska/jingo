MGs and Flamers do not meet the minimum required range for direct-fire ballistic or direct-fire energy weapons, so they should not be able to fire at LOS range (TacOps p85).

MGs and Flamers are not flagged as DIRECT_FIRE, so they can fire at LOS Range in MegaMek (but shouldn't be able to according to TacOps LOS Range rules).
