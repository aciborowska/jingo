Version 0.41.27

Description:

Natural aptitude: gunnery and natural aptitude: piloting are not in the list of SPAs when you configure a pilot, and therefore you cannot choose them.

This issue is also true in the MekHQ, but I'm guessing that fixing here will probably fix it there, too, so I opened this bug only for MegaMek.

To reproduce:

1. Start MegaMek.
2. Add a 'Mech (any will do).
3. Double-click the 'Mech to open the configuration dialog.
4. Under the Pilot tab, scroll down and try to find natural aptitude: gunnery and natural aptitude: piloting. They are not there.
