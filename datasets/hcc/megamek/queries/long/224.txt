If you have a prone mech and click backup, and then try to backup into a hex, you have to pay 3 MP to stand for some reason, whereas if you click getup first, you only pay 2 MP to stand. To replicate, just start a new game with any prone mech using the lobby deployment options and then try using the backup button.
