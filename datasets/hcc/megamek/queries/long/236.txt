Playing a game on a mixed Open Terrain (8 total sheets) and City Tech (1 sheet) map which is al clear Terrain. Planetary conditions are -10C temp and heavy snowfall. There have been no fires but the PSR rolls are including swamp conditions.

Normally when a snow hex (thin snow in this case) is attacked it is supposed to convert to mud. The locations of the enemy units which prompted this ticket are all in clear, snow covered terrain that has now been attacked.
