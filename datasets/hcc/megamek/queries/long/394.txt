This was detected multiple times in 0.41.22, but it is likely still applicable in the current version as there is no mention of hidden units since that version.

Atmosphere: Trace.  (Probably also happens in vacuum, water.)
A hidden unit activates during the firing phase.  
When the unit takes damage, it should roll for a breach check.  Also, if its internal structure is exposed, that section should be breached.  Neither of these things happen.

It doesn't matter whether due to point blank shooting or if set to activate in a previous phase, same issue.  Attached save contains example of unit activating at the start of the firing phase.  I have a log from a different game of the issue occurring after being spotted while point blanking, if needed.

In later rounds, breaches do properly get detected when the section takes damage.
