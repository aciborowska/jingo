For some reason Princess would get to 96% calculating the movement for the Lighting and then freeze.  With the error:
22:23:23,016 ERROR [megamek.server.Server] {Packet Pump} 
error: server got invalid movement packet from connection 1, Entity: Lightning LTN-G15
BotClient calculated turns, Princess phase PHASE_FIRING 8/8

I dont see anything wrong with where that Lightning could move?
