[337th or WordAir.sav.gz](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/files/174204/337th.or.WordAir.sav.gz)

Firing phase fails to start after moving all units. I'm running two separate windows clients on the same computer, each saved in a different directory with independent logs and configuration files. 

The server doesn't seem to die, as I can still issue commands and even skip the WordAir player.  Skipping sends me to the offboard phase report, but then I can't move on to the firing phase.  I tried reverting to another save (337th) from the end of the previous turn.  New initiative on turn 11 is rolled and I can move all units, but again the firing phase doesn't start. 

The server log shows this sometimes, but the log timestamp doesn't show it being updated at the exact time of the issue.

Full log file is attached, though it contains a start, a skip and an attempt to replace WordAir with a bot in order to move to the next phase.  The bot can't get past the offboard attack report either.
