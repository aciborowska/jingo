I was trying to create a map filled with elevation changes and roads to test another issue, so i set roads to 100% and elevation to the "high" setitng.

After clicking "okay", I noticed that "map selected" had switchd to "SURPRISE" instead of "GENERATED". It should be on GENERATED as im using the generated map settings. The map preview didnt change everytime i previewed it, which meant that it was using a stock map instead of randomly generating it each time.

When I set it to use the generated map settings instead, It didnt seem to be using the custom settings i had chosen...i set roads to 100%, but it only generated a handful of road hexes instead of roads in every hex. See the lower part of the screenshot.
