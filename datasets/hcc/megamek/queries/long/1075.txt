I think the damage is being calculated wrong.  The infantry unit has the clan armor with a divisor of 2 so, according to pg 216 of TW pulse weapons damage is changed by Damage /10 + 2.
So large pulse should do an initial of 10 / 10 + 2 = 3
Infantry in the open doubles = 6
And my infantry has a dmg divisor of 2.0 from armor so = 3
The way it is reporting it is just goofy too "damaged changed from 10 to 6" doesn't seem right.  Should be 3 they way Im reading the table from TW.
I would just ask that the math on this in the code be double-checked doesn't seem right.
