Per TacOps, page 295: "Use of UMUs imposes a +3 attacker movement modifier on all attack to-hits made by the UMU-equipped unit, as though the unit were jumping. However, UMUs generate only 1 heat point per turn total, regardless of the number of UMU MPs used."

The attack movement modifier and heat are not being applied at the moment.
