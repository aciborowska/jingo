In the designate artillery targets phase at the start of the game, i saved, closed MM, and reloaded the save. I was able to designate targets as normal, but when trying to proceed to the deployment phase, MM did nothing. I was able to save the game again, but reloading the save game just gave me a "waiting on the server" blank screen.

Error log has this : 

`GameReports.get(int) [ERROR] ERROR: GameReports.get() was asked for reports of a round [1] which it does not posses.
