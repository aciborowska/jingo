Was testing a dropship landing on this map, game kind of hanged for a while once I finally landed and it had to do all of its calculations for terrain damage but not the point of this.  Next round I clicked View>Round Report to copy ctrl+c and paste ctrl+v the landing damage and it would not copy the text into the clipboard.  Ended turn to get to the current round's round report and then could finally copy and paste text from the end round report.  Windows 7 HQ 0.42.1
