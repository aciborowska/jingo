Custom atmospheric.tileset file causing BoardView1.drawHex NPE in 0.41.19 Map Editor, but is working fine in 0.41.17.

Atmospheric.tileset file was edited from 0.3.29/0.41.19 download. When trying to open A Test Set 2 - 34 x 35.board from 0.41.19 map editor, I will either get the BoardView1.drawHex NPE (and frozen) or the board will not get loaded properly.

When tested on 0.3.27/0.41.17 map editor using the same tileset, board and custom images, everything was loaded without any problem.
