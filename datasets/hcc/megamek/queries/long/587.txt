Fighters that are destroyed while they are part of squadrons do not have any damage applied. Those that survive have capital scale damage applied as standard scale regardless of whether the aero sanity option is in use. While this does not affect the game in MegaMek, it does affect post-battle resolution in MekHQ and any exported entity list file.
