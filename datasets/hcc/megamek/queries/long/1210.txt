I started a space game against Princess.  My force had two _McKenna_ battleships and Princess had two _Texas_ battleships and some kind of destroyer.  Each of my _McKennas_ had six Santa Anna missiles in their AR10 bays, but those were never fired.

We played through the first turn with no damage done.  During the end phase, I clicked on the "Done" button and the game would not move further.  Logs and savegame attached.
