In the current build, when a mech is standing in depth 1 water and comes under attack from ranged weapons, if the attack hits the legs, it's not negated.

Reproduce: put a mech into depth 1 water
fire at it with another mech (in my case, the other mech was on level 0 ground outside the lake)
observe leg damage inflicted
