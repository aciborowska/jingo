Weapons fire for Phoenix Hawk PXH-1 #2 (The Infamous Dust)
    Large Laser at Hex 3733 of Building #1876667794 (Collapse)needs 4, rolls 8 : hits.

        Medium Standard Building #1876667794 absorbs 8 points of damage. 
            42 CF remaining.
        Damage threshold exceeded. Possible critical hit!
            Ammunition explosion! Building #1876667794 takes 0 damage, reducing its CF to 42.

Turret bark should be "luckily there is no ammo to explode." IIRC. Guess they need a minor update to account for the new turrets. 

side note: should this crit have been re-rolled since energy weapon turrets have no ammo? I'm unsure.
