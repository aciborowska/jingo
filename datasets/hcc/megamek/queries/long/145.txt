## Requested test/bug:  Infantry are not impacted by fire if above the bottom floor level of a building

Step to repro:
1) Pick a unit with flamers and a foot/jump platoon
2) Pick a map such as Suburbs with multi-level buildings
3) Place the infantry on FL2+ of a building
4) Use the flamers to light the building on fire.
5) Note the infantry are not impacted until the building burns down.

Note:  This may be an extension of the general issues with infantry not taking proper damage inside of buildings, currently bugged on the other tracker; I am unsure.
