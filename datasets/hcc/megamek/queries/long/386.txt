Tested with a fresh install.

1. Add Cavalry Attack Helicopter (Standard)
2. Configure Start Height = 1
3. Select Moonless Night
4. Start Game

During deployment, after picking a level 0 hex for deployment, unit shown as elevation 1. 

During round 1, same unit suddenly went to elevation 2. Current Sensor and Max is blank. From graphics, the visual became unlimited (or very long range).

Tried with dawn/dusk and fullmoon night, current sensor and max visual range still blank.

Savegame attached.
