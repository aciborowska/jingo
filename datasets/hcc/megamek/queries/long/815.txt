Aerospace unit movement on space maps seems very off.  When I add thrust from a standstill, it starts counting how many hexes I can move.  For an example, I accelerate a _Texas_ with three thrust points, yet I can only move two hexes.  If I try to move three hexes, I get the "This unit has not used all of its velocity." error.  I can only move two hexes at the most.
