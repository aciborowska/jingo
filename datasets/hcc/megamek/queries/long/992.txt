### Environment

MegaMek version 0.43.10-RC4
Windows 10
Java version 1.8.0_171

### Description

MegaMek displays portraits with a 1:1.16 pixel ratio regardless of image's dimensions. As an extreme example, I created an image that is 20 pixels wide, 100 pixels high:

This image displays as follows in MegaMek:

However, MekHQ preserves the dimensions ratio:

I then tried with an image that is 100 pixels wide, 20 pixels high:

MekHQ:

The pixel ratio was retained in MekHQ.

MegaMek should preserve the image's dimensions ratio just as MekHQ does.
