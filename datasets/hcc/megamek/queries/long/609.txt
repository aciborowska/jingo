This issue was originally reported on the Mekwars forums [here](http://www.mekwars.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=9502&p=69034#p69034).

When an entity is displaced into a hex that contains both water and ice, the ice isn't being factored in correctly.  According to P. 50 of Tactical Operations:

> Any ’Mech or ground vehicle that enters an ice-covered water hex may break through the ice and fall into the water below unless the hex is frozen solid. VTOLs and WiGE vehicles can only break through the ice if they are landing on it. Roll 1D6. On a result of 6, the ice breaks and the unit falls into the water.

This isn't happening. There is no check for the ice breaking, and there is a PSR rolled for entering water, instead. Even though the ice is still intact. Also, if the displaced unit is a vehicle, it is destroyed. There is then a PSR for whatever caused the displacement with a +4 for being displaced onto ice. That is functioning correctly. The unit is even placed on top of the ice where it should be, it's just not checking for the ice breaking and it is forcing a PSR for entering water when it shouldn't.

I have attached relevant logs as well as a save that shows the issue.  The save is at a point where either player can charge the other and possibly force a displacement.

I plan on submitting a pull request for this issue myself, I just wanted to get the issue reported first.
