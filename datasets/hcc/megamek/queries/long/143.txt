**From FM:3145 pg 253**
Superheavy Endo-Steel Structure: Superheavy Endo-Steel Structure takes up 10 percent of a Superheavy BattleMech’s total weight (rounded up to the nearest half ton), and occupies 7 slots on the Superheavy ’Mech’s Critical Hit Table (the equivalent of 14 critical slots on a standard BattleMech).

Checking in MML with a 200 ton Mech, the Endo Steel is coming in at 10 tonnes and 7 crit spaces.
