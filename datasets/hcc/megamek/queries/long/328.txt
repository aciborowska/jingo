Playing a game with Obvious, my Stuka went out of control and was looking through the buttons because I couldnt figure out why maneuvers wouldnt work (was on a space map) and the launch button was available but, craft was out in space not inside a dropship or on the ground obviously.

Player name: AFFS-FSAC-2REG-2BN-ECO
