Having the "Individual Initiative" and "[unit type] Lance Movement" enabled at the same time leads to a game-corrupting error.

Multiple units move on the first of those units' initiative.  When one of the units that has already moved gets its turn in the initiative order, you get an error saying that the current player has no units to move.

MegaMek should not allow both of these options to be enabled at the same time.  Maybe gray out/disable one or the other when the other one is toggled on.
