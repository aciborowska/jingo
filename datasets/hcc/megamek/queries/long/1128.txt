Okay, my Peregrine is adjacent to the exploding enemy unit, but shouldn't the fact that I'm 5 hexes up protect me from the explosion??? I could understand a PSR check due to the shockwave, but if it affects the VTOL at that height then that would mean the explosion was 5-7 hexes, depending on how you count, large instead of just one.
Err maybe that's how it would work RAW, but it just doesn't make sense to me so... bug/enhancement report?
