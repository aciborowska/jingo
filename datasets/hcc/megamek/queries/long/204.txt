The first BA squad in this savegame cannot move to any adjacent building hexes even though it is on floor 1 of the building hex. The second BA squad in the same hex can move to adjacent building hexes, and after moving the second BA squad, the first BA squad can walk/run into adjacent building hexes normally.
