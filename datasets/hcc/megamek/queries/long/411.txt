I've discovered that the map "Jakes Wide Blue River1" a 35x35 map, is using woods:0 which seems to be an illegal terrain type that is only partly implemented.

It blocks hover vees, but does not cost extra for mechs to cross. 

MM should reject maps with illegal terrain types, or the map editor should not allow them to be saved.
