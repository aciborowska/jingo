I was flying a VTOL up a river which has a bridge crossing it. I could not fly over the bridge and continue up the river no matter what elevation I raised or lowered the VTOL to. Each time I tried I got grayed out movement numbers.  

I'm wondering if the VTOL is stuck on trying to "Go Through" or some other movement mode which doesn't make sense for VTOLs. I was using MegaMek 0.42.0. I did have many (more than not) advance options on.  

If you like I can provide a save file, when I get home.
