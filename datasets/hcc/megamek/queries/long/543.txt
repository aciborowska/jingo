Post this from a Facebook question.

A java question... i am using a Surface Book with resolution at default (3000 x 2000). Text entry fields in Mega Mek appear as slits. I have adjusted resolution and text sizes in windows with no improvement. Is there a java setting that I can adjust?

I've experienced this as well on my laptop (4k screen).  I found a workaround on google but didn't have the link anymore.

Edit...

Think this might have been the link
