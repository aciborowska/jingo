The path separators for board files are set by the server.  MapSettings stores the available boards as a List<String>, which ultimately gets generated by Server.scanForBoardsInDir.  If the available boards are created by a windows server, they will use a "\" as the path separator.  Those paths then get sent to the clients.  If my client is Linux, and I try to view a board, I'll get a log message like:

```
java.io.FileNotFoundException: data/boards/\unofficial\Jayof9s\35x35\35x35 Tigerlands Processing Plant.board (No such file or directory)
error opening file to load board!
```
