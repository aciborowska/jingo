Tested this out to figure out how the drawing order should be with roads and other terrain occupying the same hex.  Rubble and road still require a PSR when moving through but only costs 1 MP in MM 0.41.20.  Swamp and sand all only cost 1 MP with roads but, swamp will require a PSR with sand also adding a +1 to the roll.  And whether the ice modifiers apply or not doesnt matter since pavement requires a PSR when running and turn just like with ice so did not test that.  So, I am just wanting to rationalize what should roads draw over and what should they not?  And also if the "above" observations are correct with how MM should be handling movement over roads that share a hex with other difficult terrain?
