Just placBelow is the list of the equipment involved and one sample unit for look up.

**BattleArmor**
Battle Armor: Phalanx Battle Armor (B)
Found in: data\mechfiles\battlearmor\3075\Phalanx (B).blk
Ammo illegal at unit's tech level (IS advanced, 3065):
BA Taser Ammo, (Unknown)
BA Taser Ammo, (Unknown)
BA Taser Ammo, (Unknown)
BA Taser Ammo, (Unknown)

Battle Armor: Shen Long Battle Armor [Pop-Up Mine]
Found in: data\mechfiles\battlearmor\3145\Liao\Shen Long BattleArmor Pop Up Mine.blk
Unallocated Equipment:
BA-Mine Launcher Ammo
BA-Mine Launcher Ammo
BA-Mine Launcher Ammo
BA-Mine Launcher Ammo 

Not sure exactly what the issue with these. But they go back to when BA construction was implemented in MM.  Arlith would have more specifics.

Turret Mounts still need to be implemented. Tm pg 262.
This allows the BA unit to work as an omni unit.

**ASF**
Aerospace Fighter: Sangihe Shrike-Thrush 'Nanook'
Found in: data\mechfiles\fighters\XTRs\Boondocks\Sangihe Shrike-Thrush Nanook.blk
Aft has 1 weapons but it can only fit 0 weapons!

The unit is using Patchwork armor. So the space used is supposed to be by the armor of the location. I think its currently using the first armor on the fighter.

Fix – complete implementation of Patchwork armor for fighters (TO pg 377-378)

Aerospace Fighter: Corsair CSR-X12 Rigid Night
Found in: data\mechfiles\fighters\XTRs\Davion\Corsair CSR-X12 Rigid Night.blk
Aft has 2 weapons but it can only fit 1 weapons!

Unit is a mixed tech unit but it is using Standard Armor.  So, 5 weapons would be allowed in the rear arc. It currently has 2 Small Lasers in the rear arc.

Fix – No clue but I suspect the issue is caused by the unit being Mix Tech.
ing this here so we have a way to remember about some units failing validation but shouldn't be.
