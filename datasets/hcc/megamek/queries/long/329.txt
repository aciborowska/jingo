v0.41.22
Using plainSkin.xml.

The board will not display. Many NPEs in the log from trying to draw it:
Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NullPointerException
    at megamek.client.ui.swing.boardview.BoardView1.paintComponent(BoardView1.java:1144)

In the skin editor, added a BoardView element to plainSkin.  Still does not display the board in Megamek.
Added a background image to that BoardView. Megamek now displays the board correctly.
