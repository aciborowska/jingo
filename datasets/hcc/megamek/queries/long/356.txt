MegaMek version 0.41.24-git

Description:

Almost all dropships have 2/3 movement, when in reality the movement values should be much more varied. For example, the Achilles (3088) has a safe thrust of 8 (8/12 movement), but in MegaMek it has 2/3 movement.

To Duplicate the Bug:
1. Open MegaMek.
2. Click "Add a Combat Unit...".
3. For the Unit Type, choose "Dropship".
4. For the Type, choose all of the categories.
5. In the list of dropships, choose any one of them and notice that they all have 2/3 movement. The only exception is the Vampire (Standard), which has 3/5 movement.
