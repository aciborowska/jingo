`Princess.getEntityToMove()` computes a move index with `Princess.calculateMoveIndex` and uses that to rank all of its units to move.  The move index can be positive, negative and 0.  Anything with a value of 0 or less will never get moved.

Each time `Princess.getEntityToMove()` is called, it picks the highest index, however it seeds the maximum value with `Double.MIN_VALUE`.  That is not a very large negative number, in fact, it's not even a negative number at all.  `Double.MIN_VALUE` is the smallest positive nonzero value of type double.  It needs to be `-Double.MAX_VALUE`.
