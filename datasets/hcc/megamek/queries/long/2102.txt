According to https://bg.battletech.com/forums/index.php?topic=69608.0 a smoke missile cloud shot on Turn 1 should clear on Turn 4. But as of 0.46.1 it goes away on Turn 3.

From what I see in the code, it's because the smoke duration counter is initially set to 3 in a fire phase, but then affected by the end phase of the same turn. Therefore, changing it to 4 should help.
