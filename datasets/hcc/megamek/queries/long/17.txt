Reactive armor critical hits are not functioning correctly.  There are two primary issues.  First is that reactive armor has it's hittable state set to false.  This means that reactive armor can't be critted and doesn't count for the purposes of determining if criticals should transfer (aka, the reactive armor crit doesn't work).  

Now, the reactive armor critical can appear to work, because of bad reasons.  Basically, when a critical is performed, it checks to see if the location has reactive armor, and if so it checks to see if the current critical slot is reactive armor.  However, it uses CriticalSlot.getIndex(), which is used for systems to indicate what type of system is there, it is _not_ used for equipment criticals at all (CriticalSlot.getMount() is used instead).

When this issue is fixed, the errata from TO Errata 3.4 pg 51 should also be incorporated (basically, rules to prevent repeated rolls if the location only contains reactive armor.
