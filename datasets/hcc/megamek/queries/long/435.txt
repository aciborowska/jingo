I've noticed this and been meaning to make a ticket for a while.

If a custom map is in use, only the host can preview it if the other players do not have it installed. The map loads and runs fine for the game, but the player without a copy can't look at it in the lobby.

I'm also told that if you connect to a game with a custom map, and your directory does not match the host exactly the same problem occurs.
