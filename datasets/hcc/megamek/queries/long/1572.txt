
Playing in MegaMek 47.2 I noticed the occasional issue with movement in the last game I was playing.  

Most were minor and could be worked around (could not climb up on a bridge (hexes 3252, 3352) or could not move through the building in hex 1048 and continue on to hex 1047)  

However I was trying to charge a Lancelot (Hex 1327) with my Blitzkrieg (Hex 1133) and I was informed that I could not reach the target.

For some reason the pathfinder wants to run past the target and then gets confused as how to reach the target.  

When I click directly on the target it shows that I can clearly reach the hex with my movement, although it unnecessarily abuses the maneuvering ace SPA
