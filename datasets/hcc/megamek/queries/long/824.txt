Pretty sure Arlith and I talked about this a couple of years ago.  But since this was specifically mentioned and ruled on by CGL I'd post the notes:

> Megamek is doing it wrong, due to the timing.  Unlike attack phase PSRs, Movement Phase PSRs happen the moment they are triggered (BMM p. 53), so you wouldn't wait until the end of the phase.  In your case, the PSR would be triggered the moment you took the 20+ points of damage.  However, you're already on the ground when that occurs (because the damage occurred from the fall).  As you don't make PSR checks to fall when you're already prone, you'd be fine.
