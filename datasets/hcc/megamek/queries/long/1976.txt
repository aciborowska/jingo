### Description
Warships don't have ammo. NavalAC has no ammo. Missile launchers have no ammo. I managed to get this to work once by creating a MekHQ campaign and launching the warship from that. However, as soon as I added another unit to the game (as an opponent), all the warship ammo went away. I can't configure the ship and add ammo either.
