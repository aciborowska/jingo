We end up using `File.toString` to generate path strings for files, both to get written into the atlas map xml and to compare to entries written in the xml file.  This causes problems when the map is written in one OS and then utilized in another.  Since we are comparing path strings, if different path separators are used, mismatches will occur.

For instance, when we package a release in Linux, and a window user tries to run it, none of the image files match, because the windows paths use `\` and the paths written in the atlas xml use `/`.
