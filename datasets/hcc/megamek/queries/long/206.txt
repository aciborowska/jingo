Even if you have the unofficial rule checked, when editing a dropship pilot in the megamek lobby, the weapon specialist SPA only allows you to use weapons by bay (e.g. artillery bay, PPC bay, laser bay, etc) instead of the individual weapons that you would be using (arrow IV, ER PPC, Large Laser, etc). You can set it to weapon specialist (artillery bay) but it has no effect when the grounded dropship is attempting to fire the individual weapons when grounded (such as arrow IV).

The dropship in the save was set to weapon specialist (artillery bay) in the lobby.
