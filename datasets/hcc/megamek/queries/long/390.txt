The include "StandardIncludes/StandardSpace.tileinc" line uncovered a bug in the tilesets where I had removed include "StandardIncludes/StandardThemes.tileinc".  Bw_atmospheric, largeTexture, and classic, because they have theme specific images for their tilesets that should draw first before the theme images inside "StandardIncludes/StandardThemes.tileinc".

If on a premade board where a building hex had its basement defined MM would display space.gif or whatever the first base image was listed in the tileset whether it was in a includes tileinc or inside the tileset.  Generated Map Settings does not define the basement when used in MM so, always displayed pavement under the building correctly.

This was never caught before because when a basement was defined MM would use the first base image found which would be lunar_plains in the standard themes which look just like pavement.  So, I have switched the positions of lunar and mars with mars now being on top and the first tileinc that MM will search for an image when one does not match and players will see redish mars_plains now.

If pavement:1 is defined and a basement is or is not defined MM will display pavement correctly because you defined the base image that it needed.  If pavement:1 is not included and a basement is not included then it just draws the building over what ever the base terrain image is for that elevation (which is correct for a super image).  But as soon as you define basement MM thinks its a terrain and looks for a base image which it cannot find.

bldg_basement_type:* should be treated exactly like bldg_ele:* and bldg_cf:* which are part of and make up a building super image and not cause MM to search for a base image when it is provided.
