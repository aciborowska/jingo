With TacOps Engine Explosions and TacOps ammo explosions turned on, the terrain isn't damaged when items/units explode. I would think these types of 'attacks' would flatten woods as if they were artillery strikes (double damage).  This is not new to 41.15, I just don't think it was ever implemented/thought about. 

If this gets added in, it would be worth checking to ensure terrain is not damaged when ammo explodes on a location protected by CASE. 

I also think a Vehicle Explodes critical hit on a vehicle with ICE should roll to set woods on fire if the vehicle is occupying a woods hex.
