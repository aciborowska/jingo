In testing sf bug https://sourceforge.net/p/megamek/bugs/3208/ 

During a test game I was not able to use a chainsaw to cut down a wooded hex. I was however able to use it in a physical attack against another mech. The dual saw also acted in this manner.

iNarc pods can be brushed off but are not targetable to do so. Also was unable to brush off the pod from the CT or at least was not able to enable the button to do so. As this falls under the punch attack table CT, R(L)T, and arms should be valid targets for a brush off. 

I looked around in the code but did not notice a section where a saw could cut down woods.
