Have been playing a tournament by myself and 7 princess bots.  Last game had the tileset on largetextures and after it was done and was in the lobby setting up the next game I changed the tileset to Bw Atmospheric.  Finished setting it up and clicked done to have the next 2 princess bots fight it out and seen this:

Changed the tileset back to largetextures while the bots were fighting and didnt fix it.  And had the NPE in the log on line 3,272.  Must not have liked that I changed the tileset while in the MM lobby when the board is not displayed.

Did not get a saved game because when it is princess vs princess its too fast, steals focus constantly, and just wont let you finish typing.
