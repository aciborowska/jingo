### Environment
MegaMek (and MegaMekLab) 0.43.8-RC2
Windows
Java version 1.8.0_161

### Description
When a Supercharger roll is failed and rerolled with Edge, the Supercharger is still considered destroyed. This issue has been observed in two separate games. Both units with Superchargers had Edge set to "Reroll MASC/Supercharger Failures" and upon failing the Supercharger roll, had their Superchargers starred and unable to be activated after that turn

After some experimentation, this development occurred, where it seems that a single Edge can be used to reroll a pair of failures in one turn (this was done in a personal server). Also, the MASC and Supercharger failure penalties are swapped (the Supercharger "failure" crit out the lower leg and GECM)
