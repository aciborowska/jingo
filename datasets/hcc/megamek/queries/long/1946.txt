0.47.7 Snapshot from 2020-05-11

I was testing the new Building Fluff functionality on a pre-existing 30x15 map (The Valley - Town map (as it had a variety of buildings)).

Using the 'Change Tileset Theme' option in the map editor worked without any problem.
Using the 'Change Tileset Theme' option in battle, however, caused the previously-seen tile displacement issue.

Is there a difference between the application of the the option in the map editor and in 'battle mode' which might cause this?
