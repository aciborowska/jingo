I'm using the stand-alone Megamek 0.47.5 on Windows 10, running a 64 bit Java Version 8 Update 251 build 1.8.0_251-b08

I've been using LAMs lately, and I've noticed a few things. I'll just post one for now, since I'm new to posting bugs.

When the optional Leaping Rules (TacOps Pg 22) are in play, any time the LAM in AirMech mode lowers itself more than 3 elevations, the game thinks it is leaping down a cliff and forces the two piloting skill rolls associated with Leaping.

I don't see anything in the LAM rules about dropping too fast, so I'm assuming it's a bug?

Thanks!
