I think this comes from the addition of PR #155, but there have been several disparate issues reported since v0.41.17 all related to displaying images.

The most common issue is an NPE in BoardView1.drawHex(3).  Commonly this is at line 2382, but I've also seen it at line 2274.  Ultimately, this issue is caused by HexTileset.HexEntry.getImage(2) returning null, which can happen if the HexEntry.images vector is empty.

BoardView1.drawHex(3) NPEs: #251, #272, #283, some mention in #281

Additionally, there have been issues with mech icons not being displayed, or camo not being displayed.  I think this issues also lie in the loaded images returning null values for some reason.

Camo/facing issues: #268, #273 

Unfortunately, these issues aren't reliably reproduceable, which has made the core problem difficult to hunt down.  All of the reports have occurred in versions after v0.41.17, and PR #155 was merged in right after the release of that version.  Additionally, it modifies how images are loaded, so I'm pretty certain it's the root of  the issue.  It's not 100% clear to me why it might return a null sometimes and not others, but I plan to add some logging code that might shed some light on this issue.

I wanted to try to collect all of the information on this issue into one thread, as currently it's all spread around.
