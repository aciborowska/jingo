When `TileMapImageLoader` was added, it allowed users to specify a location within an image atlas or tile map within the tilesets.  It enabled syntax of the form:

`boring_atlas.png(168,504-84,72)`

which indicates to look in the `boring_atlas.png` file, at location 168,504, and pull out an 84x72 image.

Because of how the code works, you can also adjust the starting position and widths with negatives to flip the images.  For instance:

`hq_boring/lf0.png(0,72-84,-72)`

which indicates the image should start at 0,72 instead of 0,0, and then go from 0,72 to 84,0, effectively flipping the image vertically.

Then, in order to support atlased images without breaking old tilesets, we created an `imgFileAtlasMap.xml` file that maps old file names to their new location in the image atlas.  For instance, entries look like this:

```
  <entry>
    <string>data/images/hexes/boring/lf0.gif</string>
    <string>data/images/hexes/boring/boring_atlas.png(168,504-84,72)</string>
  </entry>
```

This says that any entry that looks for the file `lf0.gif` shouldn't look for that file, but instead open up the specified atlas and return the image.

The issue then becomes when someone uses the image-flipping syntax.  Instead of looking in the atlas-img map, it thinks it's an atlas itself, however there's no longer a `lf0.gif` file, and it fails to load.
