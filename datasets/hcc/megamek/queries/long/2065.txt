Version 0.47.7

PPC Capacitors are not generating any heat on the turn that they are charged.
As per the BattleMech Manual page 105, the action of charging a PPC should generate the same +5 heat as on any turn where the charge is held but not fired.

Attached is a save file where this was tested.
