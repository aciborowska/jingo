I have a MegaMek on my little VPS and players had a strange error:
http://pastebin.com/aFjvX4ee

It starts on the line 207 with "Report.addNewline failed, array index out of bounds" and repeated . Server hanged for awhile, but managed to "unloop" itself after a few minutes. I wasn't playing with them. Does anyone have idea of what could happened?

thanks
