I did combat, got victory. After declared victory, and game asked that do I make salvage-file, where I answered yes, like I always do, megamek crashed. And I was back at commandline.
`$ cd Desktop/mekhq-0.3.31/;java -jar MekHQ.jar`
`Redirecting output to mekhqlog.txt`

`The program 'java' received an X Window System error.`
`This probably reflects a bug in the program.`
`The error was 'BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)'.`
`(Details: serial 31875679 error_code 8 request_code 42 minor_code 0)`
`(Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;`
`that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.`
`To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line`
`option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful`
`backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)`
no salvage.mul created - timestamp was from previous game.
Because that was untouched, I concluded that crash was at megamek, not at mekHQ.
