This is a repost of the issue previously noted here, but I think the problem might have slipped through the cracks as Sourceforge seems to have been dropped and the ticket here was closed. The previous two links can be found here:

To sum things up, AoE damage should be dealing more damage to buildings. Megamek also currently does not damage units located within buildings that are hit by an AoE attack.
