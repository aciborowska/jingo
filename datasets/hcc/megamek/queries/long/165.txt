This was originally posted [here](http://bg.battletech.com/forums/index.php?topic=52278.msg1208970#msg1208970).

Looking at the code, it would appear that code was copied from the `// Check for ECM between spotter and start` block to the `// ECMInfo for line between spotter's position and end's position` but the null guards remained `spotterStartECM` instead of being updated to `spotterEndECM`.

I would like to get a saved game to be able to reproduce this to know that it's fixed, waiting on a reply from the OP.
