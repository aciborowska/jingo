When moving, attempt to plot a move to/through a hex that an unseen, undetected enemy unit is.  Normally, Megamek does not take this enemy unit into account when pathfinding (which is correct).  However, the attached save has an instance of an unseen, undetected affecting pathfinder.

If the move tries to end in the illegal hex, the number in the final hex turns gray.
If the move tries to go through the enemy unit, a path is plotted around that unit.
This gives information to the player that it should not have (and prevents moves which should be allowed to be attempted).


In the attached save, connect as "Pirates".
There are enemy mechs in 1739, 1934, and 1935.
Attempt to move VL-2T Paula Yi in hex 1938 to hex 1935.  Megamek will not let you do so.  The movement number is gray (should be yellow for running).  
Attempt to move to 1933 or 1934.  Megamek plots a course around the tunnels to the west instead of the obvious direct route.  This is especially strange because there is another enemy mech in 1739 which _doesn't_ block the pathfinder.

Normally when you attempt to move into/through an enemy unit, Megamek lets you enter that move and then your unit's movement gets stopped short.  I'm not sure what is special in this case.  Megamek correctly lets you attempt to move through the mech in 1739 and stops you in 1839, for example.

My guess is something is strange about the status of the mech in 1935 that is causing the pathfinder to count its hex as blocked.
