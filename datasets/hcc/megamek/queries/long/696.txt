I fired Arrow IV infernos at the hex with the stormcrow, but for some reason the adjacent Fire Falcon D was getting cover from the Arrow IVs...even though it was right next to the target hex.

`Weapons fire for Mobile Long Tom Artillery LT-MOB-27 #2 (#battletech)
    Arrow IV at Hex: 2345 (Artillery); needs 1, rolls 12 : hits the intended hex 2345.
        Inferno fire (Arrow IV) started in hex 2345.
            Ryoken (Stormcrow) C (Clan Jade Falcon) hit by Inferno IV:                Target gains 10 more heat during heat phase.


        Inferno fire (Arrow IV) started in hex 2344.
        Inferno fire (Arrow IV) started in hex 2444.
        Inferno fire (Arrow IV) started in hex 2445.
        Inferno fire (Arrow IV) started in hex 2346.
        Inferno fire (Arrow IV) started in hex 2245.
            Fire Falcon D (Clan Jade Falcon) hit by Inferno IV:                Target gains 0 more heat during heat phase.

                5 missiles hit the cover.`

Im also not sure why it says 5 missiles hit the cover when it was one Arrow IV Inferno.
