Tested this in 41.16 by jumping a Spider into Level 4 water I failed the pilot check and only suffered one damage.

_TW pg 57.
If a unit below the water’s surface falls, it suffers normal falling damage divided by 2 (see Falling, p. 68). A unit above the water’s surface suffers normal falling damage divided by 2 for hitting the water’s surface and normal falling damage divided by 2 for the fall from the water’s surface to
the bottom of the water hex. Normal damage for hitting the water’s surface equals tonnage/10 (round up) x (# of levels fallen + 1)/2. Normal damage for hitting the bottom of the water hex equals tonnage/10 (round up) x (depth of water hex + 1)/2. Damage is resolved separately.__
