I feel very strongly that when multiple units occupy the same hex that either the tallest/highest units should draw over all those below them or at least the opponents units would draw above the player's own.  Infantry > vehicles > mechs > aerospace fighters.  This is a bird's eye view point game so, I would think that makes sense that the highest unit would draw over all those below it.  Currently it's almost like MM can hide targets from you if you did not realize or see that the other player had moved one of their units into the same hex as say two of your tanks.  Yes the name tags are visible but, can be covered up by the player's unit's name tags if several player units are grouped together.  I am human I do make mistakes and sometimes do not pay attention but, it would help me at least to be able to see all of my opponents units in LOS during the firing phase and not have any of them hidden under my own.

 There is an enemy Panther is hex 2527 under the two condor tanks with it's name tag partially covered up by Condor #32.  I usually play zoomed out to the level before the hex coords disappear and this just works against me.
