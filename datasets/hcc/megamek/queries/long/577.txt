When adding a unit in MegaMek lobby, some units are missing their unit icons or they display the icon of the previously selected unit. Adding such a unit will cause the unit list in the lobby to be garbled and/or the UI buttons in "Add a Combat Unit" to stop functioning.

The problem does not occur in 0.43.2 or previous versions. Some of the units that show this error when selected are:

All 10 ton Armored Personnel Carrier (Wheeled and variants)
All 10 ton Armored Personnel Carrier (Tracked)
10 ton Armored Personal Carrier (Hover Primitive)

Achileus Light Battle Armor (All variants)
Gray Death Standard Battle Armor (All variants)
