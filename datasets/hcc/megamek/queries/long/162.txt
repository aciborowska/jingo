This looks to have been introduced in 32d7af3c, where mouse 3 for toggling minimap/unitdisplay was added.

The problem is with ClientGUI.setDisplayVisible(boolean visible).  Code was added to check to see if a unit was selected, and if not it selects one, otherwise setting the UnitDisplay visibility to true could cause issues.

When DeploymentDisplay.gameTurnChange gets called for the first time, and ClientGUI.setDisplayVisible is called, this new code will call UnitDisplay.selectEntity, but since ClientGUI.mechW has never been visible yet, it has never called ArmorPanel.addNotify(), so the DisplayMapSets are never get initialized, and this warning is printed.
