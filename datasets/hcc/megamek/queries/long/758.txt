`Princess` and `TestBot` both use `Game.getFirstDeployableEntityNum` directly to get the unit that they are deploying.  The problem is, this method doesn't guarantee that the unit returned is owned by the player the bot controls.  I think that the way non-sim deployment is setup, this works out but with simultaneous deployment, the bot will frequently try to deploy units it doesn't own.
