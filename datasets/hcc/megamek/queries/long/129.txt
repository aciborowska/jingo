This is from the most recent errata, though looking back on the code I am not sure what the previous was based on. There was a section removed in 08 that had MoF as an option and added some LRMs as scatterable though it was not based on anything in TacOps.

This is the second artillery fix I will be posting to a new PR along with #128
