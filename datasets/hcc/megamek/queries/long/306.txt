During my last AtB scenario Princess froze right after one of my ASFs returned to the map. I fixed the issue by kicking the concerned bot and replacing it (default bot settings). The log shows the following:

Exception in thread "Princess-precognition (Clan Jade Falcon (Reinforcements))" java.lang.NullPointerException
    at megamek.client.bot.princess.Precognition.dirtifyUnit(Precognition.java:576)
    at megamek.client.bot.princess.Precognition.processGameEvents(Precognition.java:528)
    at megamek.client.bot.princess.Precognition.run(Precognition.java:420)

This might not be related to ASFs at all but it is the only thing that I can think of that changed prior to the freeze. Also the ASF did return after failing a maneuver not after me flying it off the map. 
Attached are mekhqlog.txt, gamelog and savegame, all up to the point of the freeze:
