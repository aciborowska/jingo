Been playing Against the Bot, and sometimes there's night battles. At one point, a fire got started accidentally, which illuminated the hex the target was in as well as the surrounding ones. This wou,d I'd imagine, reveal the other units in those hexes, however only those within normal darkness LoS were revealed, the mech out of LoS but within the light of the fire still showed up as a sensor contact. Attached is the save file of the battle, there's the fire, it's Full Moon Night so only 5 hexes of LoS.

Also enemies in fire's light still need to be within LoS or sensor range to be fired upon.

The version of megamek is .0.41.15, the version of MechHQ is 0.3.25
