Currently the flare artillery rounds are reducing the to-hit modifier of a target when they have lit an area (which is correct), but fail to illuminate the target for units that have LOS into the illuminated area, like other light sources do (such as fire).

Steps to repro:
1) Set Moonless Night
2) Load up a Vali with Flare Rounds a 0 gunner
3) Put a unit in the dark but in direct LOS of each other (at least 6 hexes away)
4) Fire a flare to illuminate the units
5) Notice that neither unit can see the other, despite being in the lit area
