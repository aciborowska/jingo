Version 0.42.0

After completing a battle that included aerospace fighters and battle armor, in the end-of-battle results, you see text similar to the following example:

> Survivors are:
> Simurgh SMG-9TF Prime (Nine-Tailed Foxes)
> Driver : Lieutenant So-hee Yoon [3/4]
> Kills : 4
> 
> ...
> 
> Black Wolf Battle Armor [Plasma] (Wolf Empire (Reinforcements))
> Gunnery Skill : Mafileokaveka [1]
> Kills : 0

The Simurgh is an ASF, and the pilot is titled as "Driver." I'm pretty sure that should be "Pilot" as it is with 'Mechs.

For the BA, the trooper's name is titled as "Gunnery Skill," which clearly is wrong. I think it should be "Trooper" or something similar.
