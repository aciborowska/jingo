Basically, if you do a facing change while the movement numbers are still blue but then continue to use run/flanking movement, you still need to take a PSR (as the popup warns) but megamek fails to display the * symbol along the path to warn that you need to make a PSR.

The easiest way to test it is to just take hovers on pretty much any map, but mechs on pavement have the same issue.

Try using this savegame to test if you like, unfortunately i dont have the log file anymore.
