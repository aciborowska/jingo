At the beginning of a game, I right-clicked on my quadvee, which was deployed in quad mode.  I went to convert, then clicked on "Vehicle", and MegaMek tries to convert the unit to a quad, even thought it already is in quad mode.  It even expends 4 MP.

The workaround is to just click on the "Convert" button in the main button group at the bottom of the screen.  That works the conversion properly.
