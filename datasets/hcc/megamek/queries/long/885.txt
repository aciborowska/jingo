So, this is an odd one.  ATB, with a DropShip flying support.  The DropShip gets shot down and crash lands.  Everything behaves normally until the turn the Bot swarms to the downed DropShip.  The Fire Phase proceeds normally until I click done with my last unit.  And then nothing.  The game simply ceases, it acts as though I never clicked done, but it wont let me continue.  There is nothing in the error log, there is nothing to indicate that anything is amiss, except the game will not continue.  I assume that the result of the Fire Phase would be the destruction of the DropShip, and that might be causing the problem.
