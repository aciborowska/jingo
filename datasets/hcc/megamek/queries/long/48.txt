I was testing using industrial mechs, using the Harvesting Ant Mech. This industrial Mech mounts 2 Combines.  

The Combine is suppose to do 1D6 damage against infantry.  When i used the Mech, it was only doing 2 damage per hit.  The Rule is found on Page 146 Total Warfare rules book. Shows what effects it suppose to do, MegaMek isn't doing it.  Couple this be coded in?
