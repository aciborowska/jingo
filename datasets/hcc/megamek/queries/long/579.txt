On round 8 firing by the Daikyu on the Kamakiri. 
The engine is critted and it falls out of the sky. 
The damage it takes from the fall is just wacky.  
I think I had noticed reflective armor taking strange damage from all physical attacks but I never thought to check the logs.  

Log is attached along with the custom configs in the attached zip.  
Load the Sins.mul to get all the quirks used.
