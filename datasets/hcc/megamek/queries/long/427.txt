_So, here's an interesting question. 
Can a mech who is prone and who still has both arms, fire two weapons that are split across both the arm and torso of each side of the mech?


Imagine this:
A Victor VTR-9B is prone. It's got an AC/20 spread across it's RT and RA. It's also got 2 Medium Lasers in its LA. During weapon declarations, it can declare to fire either the AC/20 or the lasers. That makes sense.


Now consider a clan Naga B who is also prone:
Its got an Arrow 4 launcher spread across it's RT and RA and another Arrow 4 launcher spread across it's LT and LA. Certainly it should be able to fire one of its Arrow 4 launchers while prone, but can it fire both while prone since the weapon isn't fully in the arm?


I'm pretty sure the answer is "No" but MegaMek let me do it (which is probably a mistake in the code, but will need an official ruling before they change it)._

CGL Answer
Following the principle that a split-location weapon uses the more restrictive arc, any scenario that forbids the use of one location applies to weapons split into that location.  So, no, it could not.
