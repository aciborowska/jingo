ATM 9 **( ammo)** at Puma (Adder) C (Clan Wolf); needs 2, rolls 5 : 9 high-explosive missile(s) hit (using Above table) (w/ +6 bonus).

There's a strange space in the bracket, im guessing that its supposed to say (HE ammo) but for some reason the round report isnt displaying the ammo type in the bracket, so its only displaying an empty space there.

If you want a save with ATM mechs to check it out, there's one here : https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/issues/380
