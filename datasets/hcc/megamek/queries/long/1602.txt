Currently, Narrow/Low profile provides a blanket +1 to-hit modifier for all attacks targeting the 'Mech with the quirk.

However, the Battletech Manual page 85 states the following:
"If the Margin of Success for a weapon attack made against a narrow/low profile ’Mech is 0 or 1, the hit is considered a glancing blow. For example, if you need to roll a 9 or better to hit the target,
a result of 10 would be a glancing blow.

A glancing blow inflicts half the normal damage (rounded down); for weapons that roll on the Cluster Hits Table, instead apply a –4 modifier to the Cluster roll result (with a minimum result of 2). Additionally, apply a –2 modifier when rolling on the Determining Critical Hits Table any time a glancing blow yields the possibility of a critical hit; if using the Advanced Determining Critical Hits rule (see p. 85, TO), apply a –4 modifier instead.

This quirk has no effect versus non-weapon attacks, such as falls or physical attacks. It also has no effect versus all-or-nothing weapon attacks, such as Streak missile launchers. If using the Linking Weapons rule (see p. 85, TO), the entire linked group is considered a glancing blow.

Damage Reduction: If also using the Glancing Blow rule (see p. 80, TO), the effects stack (1/4 damage is dealt). Any subtractive damage reduction effects (such as ferro-lamellor armor) are applied after all other damage reduction effects."
