Minor issue:  The price of Industrial TSM is priced incorrectly as normal Myomer.  It's proper value is 12,000 cbills x unit tonnage (Page 277 - Tech Manual).

Steps to repro:
1) Set a 100 'mech to Industrial Frame
2) Set Industrial TSM
3) Break down the cost
4) Notice the price rated for the myomer is 200,000
5) Notice the correct price is 1,200,000
