After deploying the last elemental BA, a small ecm field centered on the elemental BA appeared, even though it has no ECM.

The SRM carriers do have ECM though, but the ECM field didnt appear when i deployed them.

Reloading the save solves the problem and causes the ECM field to be displayed correctly.
