Hi,
this is the first time for me that Princess did not manage to move at all during my AtB time hence I looked into the mekhqlog.txt and saw the following error:

Exception in thread "Princess-precognition (Clan Jade Falcon)" java.lang.NullPointerException
    at megamek.client.bot.princess.PathEnumerator.adjustPathForBidge(PathEnumerator.java:308)
    at megamek.client.bot.princess.PathEnumerator.adjustPathsForBridges(PathEnumerator.java:300)
    at megamek.client.bot.princess.PathEnumerator.recalculateMovesFor(PathEnumerator.java:264)
    at megamek.client.bot.princess.Precognition.run(Precognition.java:424)
    at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)

This is repeated for all of the four bots in the current game.
At first I started the game the usual way, without changing anything concerning the bots, via the briefing room in MekHQ. The Bots deployed fine but did not move in the first round. I saved the game and restarted both programms and added bots with different personalities - no change. /skiping the first bot controlled unit brings no changes as well. I'm fairly sure that the bot is completely inactive since the CPU load is at 0%.

MekHQ 0.3.25, MegaMek 0.41.15
attached are the campaign savegame, megamek savegame and mekhqlog.txt

I'd guess that simply starting a new instance of the scenario would fix the problem by generating a new map but for the time being I won't continue in case further information is needed. Please let me know if you require further files.
