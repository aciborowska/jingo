Playing a game with artillery and had a weird time trying to figure out why it looked like certain units should be taking damage but they didn't. When looking at the round reports and comparing it to the map, the actual hex the artillery scattered into does not contain the explosion. The explosion image is instead still located where the initial target was.  

Attached is a save game showing the problem. You should be able to look back at the reports and see the correct hexes, if you load as player Xenon54z (or Kreedo since he has the artillery units in the convoy).  

Let me know if you need anything else.
Version is MegaMek 0.41.15 and log is attached.
