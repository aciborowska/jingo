I was just messing around with a Mad Max-esque scenario with technicals, jeeps, and motorized infantry and apparently Princessbot didn't like it.

### Description
Princessbot is consistently freezing around Round 2-6 when using a Apocalypse World Rover (player) against an Infantry Mechanized Hover Platoon (bot). Unable to skip.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Load attached save game
2. Advance turn
3. Game should hang on Princessbot's turn. (If it doesn't, try advancing a few more turns. In all my tests it consistently freezes, just not on the same turn.)

I've run several battles with infantry on different maps and gotten the same results.
