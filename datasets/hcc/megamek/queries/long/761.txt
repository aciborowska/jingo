Ghost Targets normally require a Pilot roll +3 to take effect, however Protomechs do not have Pilot scores.  In their absence, the Protomech's Gunnery score <i>should</i> be used, but right now it does not.

This is obviously a target number of 5+3=7. I set this unit's Gunnery at 1, so the target should have been 4.

This has been confirmed for future errata clarification.
