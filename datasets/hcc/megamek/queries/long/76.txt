I played a AtB chase (defend) scenario and deployed a Mech Star and an ASF Flight in MekHQ. During the battle one of my fighters crashed without exploding after failing her heat-related PSR.During the next turn I ejected the pilot, who was unharmed at this point. The game was won soon after (I used /victory) and the usuall resolve scenario dialog in MekHQ opened up which wrongly showed the ejected Pilot as dead. After checking the gamelog I think the pilot ejected successfully but was not correctly saved/written in the log as having ejected but simply vanished. An enemy Mech Warrior ejected during the same game and was correctly displayed.
- MlHQ 0.3.25, MegaMek 0.41.15
- conditions were calm
- Ejected Pilots Flee is enabled
- only checked boxes in the Aerospace Tab are 
  "allow aerospace units on ground maps"
  "allow return flyovers"

In the attached .zip are:
- the complete gamelog.html, search for Stuka
- save during the game before the crash "asd"
- autosave before I declared victory

This issue is obviously not a priority since the user should check and correct the resolve dialog in MekHQ and an ejected Pilot does not contribute to the specific MegaMek game anyway.
