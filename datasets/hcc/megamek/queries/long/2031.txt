v.47.7

'Mechs that have Overview/Capabilities/Deployment sections at the bottom of their "Summary" section (such as the Command COM-2D) only print the first paragraph of each section; if the Mechfile of the COM-2D is opened, it's possible to see that more paragraphs were written but aren't appearing in Megamek itself.
