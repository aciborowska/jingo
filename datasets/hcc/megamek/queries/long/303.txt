In some situations, cluster hits (missiles, infantry strength) can be reported on misses for units in a building hex, even if no damage is dealt.  Looks like the source for this issue is in WeaponHandler.handleSpecialMiss, which will report that there's a special miss handling case for hits missing units in a building.  Comments reference BMR rules where a building would be damaged on a miss.

In TW, damage is only dealt when a unit is adjacent and the target is non-infantry.  This is properly handled, however there are some situations were cluster reports are added unnecessarily.
