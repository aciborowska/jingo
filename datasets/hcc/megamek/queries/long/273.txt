Trying to work on making a movie for the weapons & sound FX but, the sprite for the Marauder II is not facing the correct direction in regards to the white facing arrow.

And I seen that camo color error in my log I think that  has to do with the color for the mini map?  Am using the poprocks high quality camos and I think it would be less problematic to just leave the unit color determination how it was in the old versions instead of going off the camo since it obviously is causing issues with custom camos.  Doesnt cause any problems though, Im blue and princess is red.
