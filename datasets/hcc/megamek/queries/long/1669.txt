In 47.4, I created a game with heavy aerospace fighters/large craft on both sides. I found that despite assigning firing targets for every weapon with my Samurai aerospace fighters, the round report only showed that only about half of them had actually fired despite the targets being valid. I recreated the game in 47.3 and firing behaved as expected, with all weapons being fired as ordered. I've attached copies of both games.
