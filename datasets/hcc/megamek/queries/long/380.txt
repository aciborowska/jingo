I just updated and i noticed that there is now a UI bug where the unit window and move button will sometimes appear on the left side of the screen. Random copies of the UI will also appear there (copies of the chat window, other buttons, etc). This didn't happen in a previous version (not sure which, i haven't updated in a long time).

Clicking a unit in the unit list on the right side of the screen is enough to get the UI bits to appear on the left.
