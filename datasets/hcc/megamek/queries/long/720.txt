I often use friendly fire running on one instance of MegaMek to test things. Since the Victory conditions PR https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/pull/662

When you play with Friendly fire on you only get one turn then game ends.  Same thing happens with or without victory conditions.

Nothing in the logs.
