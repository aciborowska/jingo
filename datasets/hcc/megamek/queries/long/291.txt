Relevant Text from post:
_Oh, also spotted several bugs with the way the game handles these terrain types.  The don't modify your PSRs.  They apply to hover vehicles, which makes no sense.  Rapids are supposed to give a chance of getting bogged down, but don't.  The MP and PSR modifiers are only supposed to apply when the water depth is >=1.  Currently, depth 0 water with rapids incurs a +1 MP modifier._

I have not tested this.
