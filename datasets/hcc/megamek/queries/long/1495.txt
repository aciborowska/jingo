### Description
Gday im pretty new to MekHQ, I'm loving it. Unfortunately lately when I run my AtB campaigns after about 3 missions the map fails to load. I move mouse around and it brings up the small instructions windows at the bottom but nothing else. I have restarted new campaigns with different units but always happens. Any ideas about this? I have no custom maps at a all.
