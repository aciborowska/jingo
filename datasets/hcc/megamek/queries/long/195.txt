I had this issue come up during a match, and was able to reproduce it a few times against bots. I was able to determine that the problem is not in the building collapse step, but rather in the basement collapse event. I tested it 7 times, and the unit was buried properly when the basement was double or if the building had more than 1 level. However, 4 times when there was a single basement on a 1 level building, the unit did not actually fall in the basement during basement collapse. Version info on last picture.

As you can see at this point there is already a problem, the WHM-6D prone in the building does not have the -1 indicator on the upper left of the hex indicating it is below the surface. Every time that indicator was present, the unit was buried properly during collapse.

And here is the unit surviving the collapse.
