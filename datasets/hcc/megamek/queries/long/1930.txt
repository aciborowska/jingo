### Environment
MegaMek 0.47.6

### Description
In MegaMek 0.47.6, the Sandblaster special piloting ability (SPA) requires that the Weapon specialist SPA also be set in order for the pilot to gain the benefit from Sandblaster. Per the rules, CamOps 79 and CamOps 82, these two SPAs are independent whereas it is not currently possible for a pilot in MegaMek to have the clustering bonus from Sandblaster without also having the to hit bonus from Weapon specialist.

### Files
I've attached a save game with 4 archers facing off with an atlas, archer 1 has both SPAs, archer 2 has the Sandblaster SPA, archer 3 had the Weapon specialist (LRM 20) SPA, and archer 4 has no SPAs. By firing on the atlas with each archer, you can see that only 1 is gaining the benefit of the Sandblaster SPA, while 1 and 3 are gaining the -2 to hit from Weapon specialist. I've also attached a gamelog if required.
