Currently trees and swamps are drawn over road images with the new tileset style.  And I dont know what is going on with that floating bridge in hex 0810 (only when isometric view is on).

I would propose cutting the:
include "StandardIncludes/BasicBridges.tileinc"
include "StandardIncludes/BasicRoads.tileinc"

and pasting them after the swamp and woods image lines so that those draw under road images.  I supposed the swamp images could be made transparent like how ice is but, IMO they should be drawn under the roads.

With iso view off that bridge image snaps back into the correct position.
