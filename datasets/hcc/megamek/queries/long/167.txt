Playing a DB game zoomed out to the first level where the hex coords disappear.  When an opposing unit comes into LOS for the first time as you can see its unit icon is drawn tiny/wrong scale (Ostol).  Have to zoom in/out or toggle iso to get the board to redraw causing the unit's icon to draw at the correct scale.
