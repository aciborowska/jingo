(Version 0.41.16) In my recent test, aerospace units were allowed to turn safely after 8 hexes, regardless of their velocity. An Aero at velocity 3, for example, should only be able to safely turn at 16 hexes. They may turn at 8, but must use additional thrust to do so. Current build does not require them to expend additional thrust.

As a note, I had all of the StratOps rules for Aerospace movement/combat turned on during the first test. During the second, I unchecked all options to the default settings. The Aero behaved in this manner during both tests.
