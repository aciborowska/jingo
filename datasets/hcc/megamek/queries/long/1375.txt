I'm pitting this here in case I forget. Here are some things I noticed in the code while working on #1353:
1. In heat mode, flamers only raise the heat of mechs and not aerospace fighters or small craft.
2. Plasma weapons apply heat effect to mechs and all aerospace units (whether they track heat or not), and do not apply extra damage to unit types that do not track heat.
3. SRM inferno ammo treats all aerospace units as aerospace fighters instead of treating conventional fighters and large craft differently (damage to SI and ignore infernos, respectively).
