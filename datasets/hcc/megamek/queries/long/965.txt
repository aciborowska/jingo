### Environment
MegaMek 0.43.9 RC3
Windows 8.1
Java 1.8.0_161

### Description
Firing an artillery weapon with Oblique Attacker, Oblique Artilleryman, or Forward Observer SPAs that doesn't land on the same turn causes the game to freeze up after the firing phase is finished. If it lands on the same turn, it resolves normally. Log file seems to indicate the indirect fire artillery handler is the issue.
