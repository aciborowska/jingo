### Environment
Version: 0.47.7
MekHQ integrated MegaMek
Windows 10
Java version 1.8.0_261

### Description
Princess locked up while attempting to move (possibly related to ejected Mechwarrior in water being the active unit?). Kicked and replaced bot, immediately locked up again, at which point I started taking logs and screenshots, etc. Uncertain if previous freeze was identical, but it shows two of the same NPE in MekHQlog.txt, while megameklog.txt does not have anything immediately obvious to me. Included both anyway.

Edit: after testing, issue reproduces  after save/quit/load and replacing all bots. Kicking the Lyran Commonwealth bot, skipping a single turn, then replacing the bot resolves the issue (at least temporarily), so it does seem linked to that specific unit.
