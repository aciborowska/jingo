Reported by @anitaa1990 : `setting_change_failed` â€“ Simulated by switching off the internet when toggling privacy settings. Verified that the event is being received in Tracks. But there are no event props for the event. I can see the event props being sent from the Logcat and there are no errors but not able to see this in Tracks.
