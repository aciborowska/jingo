This was originally reported as part of #1863 but I was able to reproduce the problem with v3.4, which was released before empty states existed.

To reproduce:

* Switch to the reviews tab and wait for it to load
* Switch to the store tab
* Rotate the device
* Switch to the reviews tab again

It's not 100% consistent, but in most cases you end up seeing an empty screen.
