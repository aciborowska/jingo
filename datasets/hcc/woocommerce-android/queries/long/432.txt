Very long product titles should take up multiple lines instead of being cut off with ellipses. For products with variations, those are currently tacked on to the end, so we can lose a lot of information doing this:

(That's missing the fact that this is the White, M variant of the product.)

We should allow multi-line product titles, in both the detail view and the line item list/fulfillment view.

Here's what iOS does for reference:
