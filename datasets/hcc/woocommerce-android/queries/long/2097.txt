**Describe the bug**
While navigating the app, sometimes products will be downloaded, but then when navigating to the "Products" screen, the products will disappear after a moment â€“ they'll be there, then suddenly are removed.

This is most noticeable while trying to generate screenshots.

**To Reproduce**
This reproduction comes from a screenshot test run. When running the screenshots test, it always comes up at least once (in 16 runs).
