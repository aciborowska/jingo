**Describe the bug**

In WP Admin, the Shipping section is hidden for virtual products. In the app, when you open the product details for a virtual product there's a Shipping section that says "Add shipping." This doesn't make sense for virtual products.

**To Reproduce**

1. Create a virtual product in your store.
2. In the app, open the Products tab.
3. Select your virtual product from the product list, scroll down, and notice the "Add shipping" section there.

**Expected behavior**

I don't expect to see a Shipping section for virtual products.

**Mobile Environment**
Please include:
- Device: moto e5 play
- Android version: 8.1.0
- WooCommerce Android version: 4.0-rc-1
