While testing this [PR](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/2231), I noticed that the `Remove end date` option in Product pricing screen is displayed when there is no end date for the sale. I'm pretty sure this was fixed in [this PR](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/2125) so maybe the changes were missed or reverted during dark mode changes ðŸ¤·
