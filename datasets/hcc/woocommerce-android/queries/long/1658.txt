**Describe the bug**

In a variable product's Variations section, each variation's visibility should be marked with a "Hidden" label if it isn't enabled. Right now, there is no indication of the variations' visibility.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to the store's Products section in WP Admin on the web.
2. Select a variable product.
3. In the Variations section, uncheck the "Enabled" box for one or more variations (to disable them).
4. In the app, go to the Products section.
5. Select that variable product.
6. In the Variations section, note that you can't tell whether or not a variation is enabled.
