**Describe the bug**

If the font size is increased or the device uses a non-English language, it's very easy for a label to be cut off especially on small screen sizes.

On the "My store" tab this can mean the word "store" not appearing at all, or the label being shortened. @nbradbury The behavior doesn't seem to match the behavior in https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/1408 â€” I still see labels appearing on all the tab icons when one is cut off.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to the device Settings app > Accessibility and increase the font size to the largest available size.
2. Open the app.
3. Tap on the "My store" tab. Note that the word "store" disappears and no other labels change.
4. Tap on the "Reviews" tab and note that it becomes "Re-" and no other labels change.

You can also go to the Settings app > System > Languages & input and change the device language to observe similar behavior with long non-English labels at a regular font size.
