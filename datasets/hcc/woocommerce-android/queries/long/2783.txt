**Describe the bug**

If I set a sale price on a product variation, that sale price goes into effect on my store. However, the product variations list has no indication that the product is on sale â€” it shows the regular price for that variation. I can only see the sale price when I view the variation details.

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to Settings > Beta Features and enable Product Editing.
2. Go to the Products tab.
3. Open a variable product.
4. Tap on Variations to open the variations list.
5. Tap on a variation to open the variation details.
6. Tap on Price.
7. Enter a sale price for that variation.
8. Tap "Done" to return to the variation detail.
9. Tap "Update" to save your changes.
10. Go back to the variations list and notice that it still shows the regular price for that variation.

**Expected behavior**

I expect the variations list to show the sale price for any variations currently on sale.
