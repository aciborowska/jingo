**Describe the bug**

I shouldn't be able to save a product with no title. If I delete the title when I'm editing the product details, I should get an error / should not be allowed to update the product.

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to the Products tab.
2. Select a product.
3. Delete the product title.
4. Tap "Update."

Notice that the product is updated and in the product list it is called "Untitled."
