"Hey guys, just to let you know the app is struggling to pull orders to display. Please shout if I need to try anything my side. Just installed the app tonight. 

It took about 3 refreshes and then it grabbed them. Had to pull 15 orders in the processing stage.
Maybe just an issue because I’m a first time user.
Thanks so much, I’ll keep bug checking. Got invited by the guys in the Cape Town office to try it out but so far loving the app.

I have 66 orders in total since Oct last year.
The app automatically closed when I tried to open it now. But second time worked fine.

About 3 tries, so two minutes in total
Yes, error with orders or something similar which was visible for like 10 seconds and then it went away
No orders view until I’d refreshed 3 times.

if I switch between tabs it takes 6 seconds to reload the orders. I can do a speed test if you need I found on my internet connection but I’m on a fibre line so it shouldn’t be noticeable.

Thanks so much!"
