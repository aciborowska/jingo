**Describe the bug**
It seems that the screen "Wrong WP account" is not being tracked, so any interaction events from it are tracked with the previous step value. Example: `unified_login_interaction, Properties: {"source":"default","flow":"login_password","step":"start","click":"view_connected_stores"}`

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Click "login with site address"
2. Enter site address and click "continue"
3. Enter an email address for a WPcom account that does not have access to the site entered in the previous screen. 
4. Finish login and the "Connected to a different WordPress.com" account error screen is displayed.
