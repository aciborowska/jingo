It looks like when a new order comes in, the orders are refreshed in Processing  tab but not in the All Orders tab. I _think_ it might have something to do with the timezone because if I change the timezone to `United States` from `India` , I am able to see the order in the list.

Note that I tested on @jaclync's site (https://funtestingusa.wpcomstaging.com) which has it's timezone set to `Los Angeles` and my test device timezone is set to `India`.
