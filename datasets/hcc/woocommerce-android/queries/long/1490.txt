**Describe the bug**

On a store with no Processing orders, after viewing an Order status filter the Processing tab will show all orders.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open a store in the app with no orders with the `Processing` status.
2. Go to the Orders section.
3. Confirm the Processing tab shows the "All orders have been processed" message.
4. Tap the search icon.
5. Select an Order status filter.
6. Tap the back arrow twice to exit the search and return to the Processing tab. Note that the tab now shows all orders.
7. Pull to refresh and note that the tab doesn't change.
8. Switch to All Orders and back to Processing and note that the Processing tab now shows the correct message (as in step 3).

**Expected behavior**

I expect the Processing tab to show the empty message every time I return to it. (This works as expected when I do a regular search and then go back.)
