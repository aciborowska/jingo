In #832 we fixed a crash that could occur when opening a notif, but another problem remains: tapping a notif opens the app but doesn't always open the detail.

To repro this, force close the app then generate a notif and tap on it.

**Update:** We originally thought the problem was due to the notif list fragment not being added yet, but that's not the case. The real problem is that [MainPresenter.getNotificationByRemoteNoteId()](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/blob/develop/WooCommerce/src/main/kotlin/com/woocommerce/android/ui/main/MainPresenter.kt#L61) is returning null in this situation, so no notif detail is opened. Note that this happens for orders as well, so it's not specific to reviews.
