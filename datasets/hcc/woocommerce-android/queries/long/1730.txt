I was trying to login to https://anitaastestwooshop.mystagingwebsite.com. When the Site picker is displayed after successful login, the app logs in to https://testwooshop.mystagingwebsite.com instead.

Debugging further, this might be because of the similarities in the site urls. We are fetching the corresponding `SiteModel` for the url based on the site name or url ([Related code](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-FluxC-Android/blob/0b047695e902489dec1ec4f09712c67d6c247e35/fluxc/src/main/java/org/wordpress/android/fluxc/persistence/SiteSqlUtils.java#L53)). If there are multiple site urls that are fetched, we take the first one from the list. 

#### Steps to reproduce
- Login to a test site and verify that you are logged in successfully to the correct site.
- Logout of the app.
- Now login to a different test site with a similar name/url to the site entered in step 1.
- Note that you are logged in to the site entered in step 1 when, in fact, you should be redirected to the site in step 3.

Note that this flow works as expected when logging in using the magic link flow.
