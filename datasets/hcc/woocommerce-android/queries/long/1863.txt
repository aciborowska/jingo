There are a few issues with empty states:

- [x] In landscape, the order list and review list empty states are cut off
- [x] The empty view isn't scrollable so on small screens there's no way to reach the buttons
- [x] On the “Orders” search screen, if you select an order status with 0 orders the empty state screen shows the message We're sorry, we couldn't find result for ""
- [x] The review list loading skeleton overlaps the empty view after rotation
- [ ]  ~~If I rotate my device to landscape while on a different tab in the app, and then open the Reviews tab, no empty state screen loads (the screen is fully blank)~~ <-- turns out this existed prior to empty states so I opened #1864 to address it.
