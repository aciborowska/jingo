**Describe the bug**

While debugging instrumentation test failures, I noticed that `pressingBackAfterBottomNavOptionChangeExitsApp` currently fails with a legitimate bug (unless the expected behavior has changed).

According to that test, we expect that when you navigate from one tab to another in the bottom nav, and then press back, it will exit the app. However, pressing back currently takes you to the previous tab.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open the app.
2. In the bottom nav, select a different tab to open that section.
3. Press the device back button.
4. Notice that the app doesn't exit; instead, you are taken to the same tab you saw in step 1.
