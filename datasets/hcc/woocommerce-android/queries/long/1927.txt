A user in zen-2705381 reported that they are able to see the Stats charts for 5 seconds before it disappears and is replaced with the empty view.

When debugging the issue, I notice that we are using a [separate API to determine if a site has orders or not](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/blob/bfe298fc4997f81fa7ceb314d0c94ff2a289a13c/WooCommerce/src/main/kotlin/com/woocommerce/android/ui/dashboard/DashboardPresenter.kt#L125-L124). This API is returning an empty array as a response which is the reason we are displaying an empty view. But the site does have orders over the past 30 days. Need to debug on why the has orders API is returning 0.
