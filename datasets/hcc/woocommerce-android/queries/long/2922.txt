**Describe the bug**

On the My store screen's in-app feedback card:

If I tap the "I like it" button, I see a dialog with a prompt to review the app. However, if I rotate my device that dialog goes away and the "I like it" button stops working.

**To Reproduce**

1. Run the app on the device. If you already have the app installed for more than 3 months, skip to Step 5.
2. Forcefully terminate it.
3. Time-travel to 3 months (plus 1 day) from the current date.
4. Open the app again.
5. The in-app feedback card should now be visible in Stats â†’ Today.
6. Tap "I like it" and notice the dialog appears with a prompt to review the app.
7. Rotate your device (e.g. from portrait to landscape) and notice the dialog disappears.
8. Tap "I like it" and notice the button is unresponsive even if you rotate the app back to portrait and/or pull to refresh.
