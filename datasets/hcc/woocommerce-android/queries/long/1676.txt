**Describe the bug**

The reviews in my review list are ordered correctly by relative date (with headings like "Today," "Older than a week," etc.) but the review detail shows "Now" as the relative date/time for every review regardless of its date.

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to the Reviews tab.
2. Select an older review.
3. Under the reviewer's name, check the review timestamp.

Repeat for reviews with different moderated status (approved/unapproved) and different dates, and notice that they always say "Now."

**Expected behavior**

The reviews should have an accurate relative date/time, such as "Now," "Last 24 hours," "Older than 7 days," etc.
