While testing this [PR](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/1174), I ran into a scenario where WooCommerce is installed and activated for my test site but the setup Wizard is not run. In this case, the user is able to successfully login to their site in the app but the stats page displays `Error fetching orders`.

#### Expected Behaviour:
- We should be able to check from the API if a WooCommerce site is configured.  
- Display an error message that specifies that WooCommerce is not setup.

#### How to reproduce:
- Create a new test site with Jetpack configured but Woo not configured.
- Open the app and try to login to the test site.
- Notice an error screen will be displayed asking to install WooCommerce in the test site.
- Install WooCommerce in the test site and activate it. Do **not** follow the setup wizard.
- Come back to the app and try to login again. 
- Notice you will be redirected to the `My Stats` page but an error snackbar will be displayed.
