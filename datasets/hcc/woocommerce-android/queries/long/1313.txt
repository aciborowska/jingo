While testing this [PR](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/1308), I noticed that when an order notification is received, if we open the app without clicking on the notification, the badge on the reviews tab is displayed. This seems a bit confusing because when clicking on the Reviews tab, we notice that there is no new notification.

Note that this does not happen when app is opened after we click on the new order notification. This only happens when we open the app directly when a new order notification is received.
