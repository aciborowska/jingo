**Describe the bug**

If I trash or spam a review, I expect it to be immediately removed from the reviews list.

However, if I open the review detail from a push notification, and then trash or spam it, the review remains in the reviews list until I pull to refresh.

**To Reproduce**

1. Close or background the app.
2. Create a new review on your store.
3. Tap the review push notification and notice the review details open.
4. Tap the "Trash" or "Spam" button.
5. Notice you are taken back to the reviews list, but the new review remains in the list.
6. Pull to refresh the screen and notice the review is now removed from the list.

**Mobile Environment**
Please include:
- Device: moto e5 play
- Android version: 8.1.0
- WooCommerce Android version: 5.1-rc-1
