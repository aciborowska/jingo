**Describe the bug**

As of version 4.6 we support multiple new order notifications. However, no matter which notification I tap on, Iâ€™m taken to the order detail screen for the most recent order (not the order whose notification I tapped on).

**To Reproduce**

1. Generate 2 new order notifications from your store.
2. Verify that you are able to see both notifications in the notifications tray.
3. Tap each order notification.

Result: No matter which order notification you tap on, it opens the most recent order details.

**Expected behavior**

Tapping a new order notification should take you to the details for that order.

**Mobile Environment**
Please include:
- Device: moto e5 play
- Android version: 8.1.0
- WooCommerce Android version: Originally observed and reported in version 4.6 (internal ref: p5T066-1nX-p2#comment-5244); reproduced in 5.0-rc-1.
