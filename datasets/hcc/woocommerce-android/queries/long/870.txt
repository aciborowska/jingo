While investigating #855, I noticed several entries in the log alerting that the app was doing [too much work on its main thread"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21126690/1673548). This can lead to temporary freezes in the app or ANRs and crashes.

The alert about `LoginWpcomService` is especially troubling given how many frames were skipped.

```
