**Describe the bug**

The store admin link in the refund notice "You can refund shipping and tax amounts in your store admin" doesn't wrap nicely. On my device, the link sits on its own line below the rest of the notice text, creating weird text wrapping that includes a widow ("amounts").

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open the app on a device with a small screen size.
2. Open the Orders tab.
3. Select an order.
4. Select "Issue Refund" to start a refund.
5. On the refund screen, check the refund notice about shipping and tax.

**Expected behavior**
I don't expect the link to be on its own line; it should wrap with the rest of the notice text.
