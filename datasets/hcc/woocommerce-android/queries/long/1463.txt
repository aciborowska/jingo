**Describe the bug**

After opening a review push notification when the app is completely closed, the review detail screen appears but never loads.

1. Working: Opening a review push notification when the Woo app is still running in the background.
2. Not working: Opening a review push notification when the Woo app is completely closed.

**To Reproduce**

1. Completely close the Woo app.
2. Receive a review push notification.
3. Tap the push notification to open the app.

Result: The app opens on the Reviews tab, but all I see is a placeholder.

If I tap the back arrow in the top left, I'm taken to the Reviews list where I can see the new review at the top of the list. From there, I can tap to open the review.
