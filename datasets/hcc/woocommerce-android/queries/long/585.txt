While adding the tracks event for notifications, I noticed that the events for tracking errors when changing the status of an order or posting an order note are not defined properly. They are missing their key fields...example:

```
AnalyticsTracker.track(
                        Stat.ORDER_STATUS_CHANGE_FAILED,
                        this.javaClass.simpleName,
                        event.error.type.toString(), event.error.message)
```
