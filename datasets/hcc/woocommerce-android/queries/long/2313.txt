**Describe the bug**

Under My store > Top performers, the product image placeholder (if a product doesn't have an image) is black on a black background in dark mode.

**To Reproduce**

1. Add a product to your store with no product image.
2. Receive enough orders for that product so it appears in the top performers section on the My store tab.
3. With the app in light mode, view the top performers section and notice that product has an image placeholder that is black on a white background.
4. Go to Settings > Appearance and switch to Dark.
5. Go back to the My store tab and notice the image placeholder is now black on a black background.
