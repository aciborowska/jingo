**Describe the bug**

When I rotate my device, the reviews badge appears even though I don't have any new reviews on my store. The badge remains when I rotate my device again and isn't cleared even after I view the Reviews tab, until I force-close and reopen the app.

**To Reproduce**

1. Open the app and notice there is no badge on the Reviews tab icon.
2. Rotate the device and notice a badge (dot) appears on the Reviews tab icon.
3. Tap to view the Reviews tab and notice the badge remains.
4. Background the app and reopen it, and notice the badge remains.
5. Force-close the app and reopen it, and notice that now the badge is cleared until you rotate your device again.

**Screenshots**

After opening the app, no badge:
