**Describe the bug**

In the product inventory settings: If the SKU field is empty and I rotate my device, the SKU field is filled with the value from the Manage stock > Quantity field.

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to the Products tab.
2. Select a product.
3. Select Inventory.
4. Delete all text from the SKU field.
5. Rotate your device. Notice it is now filled with a number that matches the number in the Manage stock > Quantity field.
6. Delete all text from the SKU field again.
7. Change the value in Manage stock > Quantity.
8. Rotate your device. Notice it is again filled with a number that matches the updated number in the Manage stock > Quantity field.
