The shipping section for a product is not displayed in the Product detail screen if there is no shipping information available. This is possibly related to the changes in [this PR](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/2617) when the bottom sheet was introduced. But since the bottom sheet is enabled only for products M3, the shipping section is no longer displayed.

Possible solutions could be to:
- enable the bottom sheet for all users since iOS is also doing the same thing.
- ensure that the option to add shipping is displayed when there is no shipping section.
