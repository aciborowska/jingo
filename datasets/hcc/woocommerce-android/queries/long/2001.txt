**Describe the bug**

If a product has a long name, the item quantity field on the refund screen (for choosing which products/how many items to refund) overlaps the product name.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a product with a long name.
2. Create an order with that product in it.
3. Go to the Orders tab and select that order.
4. Select "Issue Refund" to start a refund.

**Expected behavior**
I expect all the product-related text there (product name, SKU, order amount/quantity) to wrap before it gets to that item quantity field.
