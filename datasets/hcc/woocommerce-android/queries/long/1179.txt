The `application_installed` event numbers are significantly less than the actual numbers. 

#### Scenarios already tested:
- I uninstalled the app I have and re-installed in the same device: `application_installed` event Is getting called.
- I manually incremented the app version code in `gradle.properties` and ran the app again. This time, `application_upgraded` was called.
- When building and running the same app again without uninstalling, neither of the events are called because the app version remains the same.
