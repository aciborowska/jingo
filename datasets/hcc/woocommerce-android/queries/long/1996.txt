While testing #1967, I noticed that when shipping fields are discarded, the correct value is not updated in the product detail screen.

#### To test
- Click on a product with shipping details available.
- Click on shipping info and modify any field in the shipping screen (change `weight` field for instance).
- Click on the `Done` button and verify that the field is updated correctly in the Product Detail screen.
- Click on shipping info again and modify the same field from step 2 in the shipping screen.
- Click on the `Back` icon and notice the discard dialog is displayed.
- Click on `Discard`.
- Notice under the `Shipping` section, the weight field is not updated correctly.
