When testing this [PR](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/1699), I noticed that a new order created is not being displayed in the `All` orders tab but is still visible in the `Processing` tab.

#### To reproduce:
- Create a new order and wait for the order notification.
- Click on the notification and you will be redirected to the Order detail screen.
- Click back from this screen and notice that in the `All` orders tab, this order is not visible.
- Click on the `Processing` tab and notice that the order is visible under `Today` section.
