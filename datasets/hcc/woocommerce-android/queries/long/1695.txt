**Describe the bug**
Following a specific set of actions I'm able to get the product list to only show the first product. Force refresh reloads everything as expected.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Click on Products. Verify the contents.
2. Click on Reviews.
3. Hit the Back button to pop back to the main screen.
4. Go back into the app. (My Store shows incorrectly, filing a separate issue for that).
5. Tap Reviews.
6. Tap Products.
