**Describe the bug**

The product list on the Products tab is no longer sorted alphabetically. It doesn't look like that was an expected change in this release, and I can't tell what the intended sort order is (it isn't alphabetical or the default sort order I see in WP Admin).

@anitaa1990 could this be an unintended change related to the sorting and filtering changes you are working on?

**To Reproduce**

1. Open the Products tab.
2. Scroll through the products tab and notice the products are not in alphabetical order anymore.
3. Compare the product list to WP Admin and notice that it isn't the same as that order, either.
