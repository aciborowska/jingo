**Describe the bug**

The app consistently stops responding when I open virtual products in the Products tab. Other products work fine, but as soon as I open a virtual product I can't scroll or exit that screen.

Error in `com.woocommerce.android/.ui.main.MainActivity`:
```
Input dispatching timed out (Waiting to send non-key event because the touched window has not finished processing certain input events that were delivered to it over 500.0ms ago.  Wait queue length: 2.  Wait queue head age: 6166.2ms.)
```

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to the Products tab.
2. Select a virtual product.
3. Try to scroll, edit, or exit the product details.
