**Describe the bug**

User is seeing cities' license plate code instead of the Turkish real city name in the WC app. For example

34 instead of Istanbul
06 instead of Ankara
01 instead of Adana.

This does not happen on WP-Admin

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1 - Go to a test site 

2 - select a product and proceed to checkout

3 - use a Turkish address (I used the one for the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations 
Kale, G√∂zc√º Sk. No:2, 06240 Ulus/Altƒ±ndaƒü/Ankara, Turkey)

4 - on the app, check the new orders and the billing and/or shipping information

**Screenshots**

This one is from the user (the entire screen is on the ticket but I cropped this part so it does not show everything)

This one is from my fake purchase on my test site:

**Expected behavior**

I expected the app to show the city name just like it does on the browser as opposed to a code, which according to the user is their licence's plates codes.
