**Describe the bug**

Tapping a review push notification should open the review detail, but instead it opens a blank My store screen. I consistently see this behavior when I have the battery saver enabled on my device; I don't see it with the battery saver disabled, so this is likely a contributing factor.

**To Reproduce**

1. Enable the battery saver on your device.
2. Close the app completely (don't just background it).
3. Receive a review on your store.
4. Tap the review push notification.
5. Notice that you are taken to a blank My store screen.
6. Disable the battery saver and repeat steps 2-4; notice that this time the review detail opens as expected.
