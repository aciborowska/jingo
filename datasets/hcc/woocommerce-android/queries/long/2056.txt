**Describe the bug**

When I select a shipping class for my product, I expect the name of the shipping name (e.g. `Free shipping`) to be displayed. Instead, the shipping class slug (e.g. `free-shipping`) is displayed.

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to the Products tab.
2. Select a physical product.
3. Select Shipping.
4. Select Shipping Class and then select a shipping class.
5. On the Shipping settings screen, notice that the shipping class slug is showing instead of the name.
