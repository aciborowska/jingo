I was able to duplicate this bug by manually creating an order in my store which marks it as paid automatically, but the `payment_method` and `payment_method_title` are both blank in the API response for the order. Since we use `payment_method_title` to determine whether or not to show or hide the customer payment, this is erroneously hiding the customer payment. We should use `date_paid_gmt` to determine if the customer has paid anything. 

You can see the difference in handling between iOS and Android:
