When testing this [PR](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/2473), I noticed that discard dialog is not displayed when an image is deleted from a product and the back button is clicked.

#### To test
- Click on a product and delete one of it's images.
- Click on the back button and notice that the discard dialog is not displayed but in the Product detail screen, the `Update` menu button is displayed.
