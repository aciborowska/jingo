**Describe the bug**

These are a few layout issues I encountered with the review detail view. We can break this up into separate issues if any of the fixes are more involved:

* In the notification list and review detail, a review’s star rating doesn’t always load right away. Pulling to refresh the notification list worked to load it, so I’m not sure if the star rating is just loaded differently from the rest of the notification and takes longer to sync?
* In the review detail, a very long review can end up overlapping the Gravatar and star rating, and get squished up against the moderation buttons. I noticed this twice, both times when I tapped the push notification to open the app and see the review: https://cloudup.com/cetydfucjZZ
* I can’t scroll the review detail. In portrait a very long review will be cut off, with no visible moderation buttons; in landscape the review may not be visible at all: https://cloudup.com/cmqluF39nF5
* In the review detail, the star rating can appear above or below the review text: https://cloudup.com/cU-eDxU7LuQ

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. On a store, leave a very long product review (e.g. 1,000+ characters).
2. Then, leave a very short product review.
3. Wait for a push notification for the long product review to come through on your device, and tap it to open the app.
4. Note any places where the review text overlaps other elements on screen.
5. Try to scroll down to view the full review or moderate it. Note that it doesn't scroll.
6. Rotate the device to landscape and note that you can't scroll to read the review.
7. Go back to the notifications list and select the very short review.
8. In the review detail, rotate your device between portrait and landscape and note that the star rating moves so it's above the review text (portrait) or below it (landscape).
