**Describe the bug**

If you get a notification about a new order, and view the order details in the Notifications tab, the email icon in the customer information section doesn't do anything. You have to go to the order details in the Orders tab to get that email icon to work.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Get a new order in your store.
2. Open the Notifications tab.
3. Tap the "You have a new order!" notification to open the order details.
4. Scroll down to the Customer information section.
5. Tap "Show billing" to see the customer's full details.
6. Next to the customer's email address, tap the email icon. Result: The icon is highlighted but nothing else happens.
7. Open the Orders tab.
8. Tap the same order to open the order details.
9. Scroll down to the Customer information section.
10. Tap "Show billing" to see the customer's full details.
11. Next to the customer's email address, tap the email icon. Result: The email app opens to send an email to that customer.

**Expected behavior**

I expect the email icon to work the same in both places (Notifications and Orders tabs).
