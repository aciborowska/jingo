**Describe the bug**

When I edit a draft product on my store, I have the option "View product on store" but it leads to a 404 error.

**To Reproduce**

1. Enable Product editing under Settings > Beta features.
2. Go to the Products tab.
3. Select a draft product to edit it. (If you don't have a draft product, select a product and go to the ellipsis menu > Product settings and change the Status to Draft. Update the product to save the draft status.)
4. Go to the ellipsis menu > View product on store.

Result: Your store opens with a 404 error.

**Expected behavior**

I expect to either not have that "View product on store" option (if draft products can't yet be previewed) or for the webview to be authenticated so I can preview the draft product.

**Mobile Environment**
Please include:
- Device: moto e5 play
- Android version: 8.1.0
- WooCommerce Android version: 4.3-rc-1
