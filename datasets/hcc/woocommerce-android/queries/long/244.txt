When switching from a nested fragment to a different top-level fragment, `onBackStackChanged` is being triggered, and our [`isActive` check](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/blob/7db2e7a9a101f654e48651f7c0422b2a70c92844/WooCommerce/src/main/kotlin/com/woocommerce/android/ui/orders/OrderListFragment.kt#L139-L141) is unintentionally `true` for all fragments, not just the one we switched to. This is because we're checking if the back stack is clear but not also verifying that the top-level fragment is the actually currently active one.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

1. Open the orders list, and open a specific order
2. Tap the 'Dashboard' button
3. Notice that a `FETCH_ORDERS` action is dispatched
