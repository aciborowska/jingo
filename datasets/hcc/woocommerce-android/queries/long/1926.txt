A user reported that when there are multiple notifications in the notifications tray that are not cleared when a new order notification is received, the cha ching sound is not played and the new notification just replaces the existing notification. 

I tested and am also able to notice the same thing. In iOS though, multiple notifications are displayed in a stack and I distinctly remember it being the same way in android too ðŸ¤”.
