**Describe the bug**

If I toggle a product setting twice (i.e. on and then off, or off and then on, so the setting appears the same as when I opened the settings) and then discard my changes, the setting is saved as if I had only toggled it once. I noticed this for settings like:

* Price > Schedule sale
* Inventory > Manage stock
* Inventory > Limit one per order

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to app Settings > Beta features > enable Products.
2. Go to the products tab.
3. Select a product to open the product details.
4. Make an edit to the product (for example, change the product title).
4. Open the Inventory section.
5. Assuming the "Manage stock" setting is currently off: Toggle the Manage stock setting on.
6. Toggle the Manage stock setting off again.
7. Tap the back button in the top left.
8. Notice a prompt appears with options to keep editing or discard changes. Select "Discard."
9. Open the Inventory section again and notice that the "Manage stock" setting is now on.

**Expected behavior**

When I make a change to product settings and then immediately revert the change, I don't expect a discard changes prompt (since I've left the settings in the same state they were in before). However, I especially don't expect that when I discard changes, any changes I made in that session will be saved!
