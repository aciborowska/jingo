When we first implemented the "Help & Support" menu item, it simply opened the device's email app with a pre-filled message to Woo support. Because of this, we added [this code](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/blob/develop/WooCommerce/src/main/kotlin/com/woocommerce/android/ui/main/MainActivity.kt#L120) which hides this menu item when there's no email client on the device. This should be removed now that we're relying on Zendesk rather than email.
