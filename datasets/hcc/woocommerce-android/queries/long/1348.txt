**Describe the bug**

I see a negative column showing in my store stats chart. This corresponds with a refund I did on an order, but in the chart I can't see any date or amount so it's unclear what it refers to. (I had to check my store in a web browser to confirm what it was.)

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Refund one or more orders in your store, until you have refunded more than you earned today (for example, by refunding orders from previous days).
2. In the app, go to the store dashboard.
3. Refresh the screen to get the latest stats.
4. Note that today's column is now negative in the stats chart.

**Expected behavior**

I expect the stats chart to at least be legible for negative amounts, e.g. to have the date and amount visible when I tap on that column in the chart.
