**Describe the bug**
`Jetpack is not installed` screen is displayed on Android even though the site is accessible on iOS. Currently we don't know why this is happening, asking users if redirects are set up.

Edit: in 2212497-zen it seems to be a redirect, the URLs in Settings >> General omit www (and in the browser www redirects to no www) but in our system there's a www making it impossible to access the site via Android App.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to 2199199-zen or 2212497-zen, copy the site url and try to access it via Android app
2. You will see the "Please install Jetpack" screen
3. On iOS it is possible to access these sites.

**Expected behavior**
I'd expect to be able to access the site both on iOS and Android and if the app checks whether Jetpack is installed - for this check to be accurate, meaning that if the user is checking www.site.com (or any of the following) - the system checks site.com, www.site.com, https://site.com, https://www.site.com, http://site.com and http://www.site.com and doesn't cause any troubles if there's a mismatch.
