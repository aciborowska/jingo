If you log into a device running < API 26 and then disable either the new orders or product reviews notifications in Settings...that setting will get backed up and carry over to other devices. The issue is that if you install the app on a device running >= API 26, then the option will be disabled, but there is no interface to re-enable it. 

To Test:
1. Install the app on a device running API 25 or less
2. Disable the product review notification
3. Install the debug version of the app on a device running API 26 or higher
4. Open `chrome://inspect`, click on the app instance, open the resources tab, expand **Local Storage** and select **com.woocommerce.android_preferences** - if the backup happened, then the value for `NOTIFS_REVIEWS_ENABLED` will be false. Since the device is running a newer API, the option to enable it is not accessible inside the app so product review notifications stop getting processed.
