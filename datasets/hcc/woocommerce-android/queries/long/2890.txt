**Describe the bug**

According to the designs (and Woo color scheme) I expect links and other highlight colors to be pink. However, they are blue (WordPress blue) instead. This includes:

* The label and outline for fields that have focus
* Links such as the "Find your site address" help link (on the site address screen)
* "Need more help?" and "OK" buttons in the "What's my site address" modal

**To Reproduce**

1. Start logged out of the app.
2. Tap the "Enter your store address" button.
3. Notice the "Site address" field has focus and is outlined in blue, and the "Find your site address" link is blue.
4. Tap the "Find your site address" link.
5. Notice the modal that appears has buttons ("Need more help?" and "OK") in blue.
