Deleting a shipment tracking from the fulfillment screen produces a bad state:

1. Open an order with at least 2 shipment trackings (or create them)
2. Go to order fulfillment and delete one of them
3. Go back to the order detail
4. Notice that both trackings are still there
5. After a while, the whole tracking section disappears
