**Describe the bug**
Shimmer effect and empty view are superposed on the comments tab.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open the app.
2. Switch tabs until it's done loading.
3. Go to the Comments tab.
4. Notice the Shimmer effect and empty view are superposed.

There might be some other way to get this behavior, but this one was the most reliable. IIRC, the first time I got this issue, I was coming back from the "Settings" screen to the main view. The loading state seems correct (the loading indicator is not showing).
