While testing the app, I noticed that `regular_price` of a product is displayed as zero, even when there is a `regular_price` defined for the product. I believe this might also be causing the discard dialog to be displayed in the Pricing screen, even when no changes have been made to the prices.

- I _believe_ the product `regular_price` and `sale_price` should be displayed in the Product detail screen, even if the sale price is 0. 
- Discard dialog should only be displayed if there were any changes made to the product pricing screen.
