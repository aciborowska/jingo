We need to clear the back stack when the user switches sites. Right now this happens:

* Tap an order to open its detail, or tap a notif to open its detail
* Go to settings
* Switch sites

When you back out of settings, the detail will still be showing (along with an error).

Note that "don't keep activities" needs to be enabled to repro this consistently.
