Weird bug when testing products. The toolbar title is reduced when clicking on a product image and rotating the screen. 

#### To test
- Click on a product image from the product detail page.
- Rotate the screen.
- Click back button from the full screen product image screen.
- Notice the toolbar title has shrunk ðŸ˜•

Note that I had `Do not keep activities` enabled while testing .
