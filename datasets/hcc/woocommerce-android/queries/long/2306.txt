**Describe the bug**

When I go to Help & Support > Contact email, a dialog appears where I can enter my email address. Under the email field, it looks like it's supposed to count the number of characters in my email address. However, it always says `0 / 50` â€” the number never updates while I'm typing or after I finish typing my email in that field.

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to Help (during login) or Help & Support (after login).
2. Select "Contact email."
3. Notice that a "Please enter your email address" dialog appears with `0 / 50` under the Email field.
4. Enter your email address in the email field. Notice the number `0 / 50` doesn't change.

**Expected behavior**

I expect the number `0` to update with the number of characters I type in the Email field.
