**Describe the bug**

In the shipment tracking, the shipment date ("Shipped %s") is translated but the date format is not localized. As a result, the date is always formatted "month day, year" even for locales that use a different format.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Add shipment tracking to an order in your store.
2. Confirm the tracking appears in the app with the correct date in English.
3. Change your device language to another language, e.g. Spanish.
4. Confirm the month is translated but the format doesn't change.

**Screenshots**

**Expected behavior**

In Spanish, I expect the date to be formatted with the day first, e.g. "30 de agosto de 2018" instead of "agosto 30, 2018."

**Isolating the problem (mark completed items with an [x]):**
- [x] I have deactivated other plugins and confirmed this bug occurs when only WooCommerce plugin is active.

**Mobile Environment**
