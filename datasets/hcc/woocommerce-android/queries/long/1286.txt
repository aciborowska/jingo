**Describe the bug**
Variable products made up of more than one attribute are displayed without the attributes

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a variable product with one attribute, create variations from this attribute
2. Purchase it
3. The selected attribute term shows up in the name in the app
4. Add a second attribute, re-create variations
5. Purchase the product (two variation dropdowns should appear on the product page)
6. Only the name of a parent variable product but not the variation itself shows up in the app.

**Screenshots**
1 attribute:

**Expected behavior**

When a variable product is purchased - I'd expect to see which particular variation is it
