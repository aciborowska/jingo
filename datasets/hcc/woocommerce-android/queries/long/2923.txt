**Describe the bug**

On the My store screen, I expect when I choose "I like it" on the in-app feedback card, the card will only be dismissed if I then choose "No Thanks" or "Rate Now."

However, if I choose "Later" it also dismisses the card. I have to background the app and return to it or relaunch the app to get the card back.

**To Reproduce**

1. Run the app on the device. If you already have the app installed for more than 3 months, skip to Step 5.
2. Forcefully terminate it.
3. Time-travel to 3 months (plus 1 day) from the current date.
4. Open the app again.
5. The card should now be visible in Stats â†’ Today.
6. Tap on I Like It.
7. Tap on Later.

Expected: The card should still be visible.
Actual: The card is dismissed.

**Mobile Environment**
Please include:
- Device: moto e5 play
- Android version: 8.1.0
- WooCommerce Android version: 5.1-rc-1
