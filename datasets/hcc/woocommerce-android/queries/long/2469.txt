**Describe the bug**

When I upload a new product image (by taking a photo or uploading from my device) I don't have any option to save it.

**To Reproduce**

1. Enable the Product Editing feature under Settings > Beta features.
2. Go to the Products tab.
3. Select a product to edit it.
4. Tap the product photos section to edit the photos.
5. Select "Add photo."
6. Choose to take a photo or upload a photo from the device.
7. After the photo finishes uploading, try to save your changes.

Result: There is no "Done" button or other button to save the changes, and if you tap the back button your only options are to continue editing or discard your changes.

**Screenshots**

**Expected behavior**

I expect the newly uploaded photo to either be autosaved for the product or have an option to manually save the changes after adding one or more photos.

For comparison, when I select a photo from my WordPress media library, I am immediately taken back to the main product details screen (instead of back to the photos screen) with the selected image added to the product.

**Mobile Environment**
Please include:
- Device: moto e5 play
- Android version: 8.1.0
- WooCommerce Android version: 4.3-rc-1
