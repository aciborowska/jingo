When testing this [PR](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/1109), I noticed that the stats page is blank after app is closed and opened again. This only happens when `Do not keep activities` is enabled.

### Steps to reproduce
* Enable `Do not keep activities`
* Click on a product from the list in `My Store` tab.
* Click on Home button and close the app. Open it again.
* Click on the close icon.
* Notice that the stats page is blank
