When testing this [PR](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/1205), I noticed that the Orders list page is blank when we click on the `Search` icon but redirect to another tab without searching for anything.

### Steps to reproduce:
- Click on the `Orders` tab and click on the `Search` icon.
- Click on the `My Store` tab.
- Click on the `Orders` tab.
- Notice that it is blank.

#### Notes
- I am able to reproduce this issue when `Do not keep activities` is enabled or disabled.
- When the `Orders` page is blank, and we click on the `Search` icon again and click the back button, notice that the `Orders` page is no longer blank.
