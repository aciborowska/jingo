**Describe the bug**

When editing a product's details, there's no way to tell which price field is selected. No cursor or other highlighting appears to show what has focus (or whether a field has focus).

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to the Products tab.
2. Select a product.
3. Select "Price."
4. Tap in the `Regular price` or `Sale price` fields and edit the amount there.
