While looking into #816 I discovered this problem with the notification list:

* Make sure an order notif is the only notif in the list
* Generate a product review notif
* Trash it from the app
* Note that the order notif disappears and the review notif remains
* Hit Undo
* Note that the review notif now appears twice
* Pull-to-refresh
* Note that the dup review notif still appears and the order notif still isn't there
