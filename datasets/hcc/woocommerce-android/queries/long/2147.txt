When testing this [PR](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/2138), I noticed that `tax_class` by default is set an empty string but the default option displayed in the UI is Standard Rate. When Standard Rate is selected again, the discard dialog is displayed (even though it shouldn't) because the `tax_class` is saved as `standard`. instead of an empty string.
