**Describe the bug**
Currently on MyStore screen, if app is resumed from the background, the current state of the screen is not maintained. So if I select the YEARS/MONTHS/WEEKS tab in MyStore screen, minimize the app and then bring it back to the foreground it will just revert back to the DAYS tab.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. After logging into your WordPress account, go to MyStore screen. 
2. Click on 'MONTHS' tab
3. Click Home button
4. Open WooCommerce app again
5. Notice that the current tab is 'DAYS'
