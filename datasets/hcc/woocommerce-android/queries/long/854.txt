**Describe the bug**
If you try to switch to a site that isn't running WooCommerce 3.5 or greater, the card in the dashboard remains even though you've switched back to the site that is running a good version.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Have at least two sites associated with your credentials, one being older than WC 3.5.
2. Attempt to switch sites from the good site to the one requiring an update.
3. Dismiss the alert to upgrade the site.
4. Tap back to go back to settings/then dashboard.
5. Notice the card to upgrade the site at the top of the screen even though you're on the good site still.

**Expected behavior**
If you abort a site switch the warnings and such should only pertain to the currently selected site.

**Mobile Environment**
Please include:
- Device: Android Emulator, Pixel 2 
- Android version: API 29
- WooCommerce Android version: develop as of yesterday
