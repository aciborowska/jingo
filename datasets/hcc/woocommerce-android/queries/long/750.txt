**Describe the bug**
When logging in with the Site Address URL, you require a WordPress.com username and password.

This is not obvious as the way the page is designed seems to ask for the username/password from the user's admin account on their website. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
- Click "Log in by entering your site address"
- Enter site URL
- Note the request for username/password under the site url
- Try entering the user/pass for an account on your website

Note that there is no indication on the page or in the login error that you are asking for a WordPress.com login.
