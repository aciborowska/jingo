**Describe the bug**

The "Cha-Ching!" sound for new order notifications isn't working. I get the push notification for a new order, but no sound is made.

The only way to get the notification to make a sound is to switch from the app-provided sound to a different system notification sound, or to reinstall the WooCommerce app.

Although the issue is resolved by reinstalling the app from the Play Store, I'm reporting it because it has come up in user reviews (including from external beta testers) and not all users experiencing the issue may try reinstalling.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to the app Settings > Manage notifications.
2. Confirm "New order alerts" is enabled.
3. Tap on the "New order alerts" setting and confirm that under "Sound" it's set to "App provided sound."
4. Close the app. On the web, complete a new order on your store.
5. Wait for the new order push notification. Result: The notification arrives but no sound is made.

Note: This issue went away when I reinstalled the app, so this may be related to updating from an older version of the app or another action I have taken previously.
