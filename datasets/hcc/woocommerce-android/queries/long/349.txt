I was recently checked on my assumption that if using `wrap_content` on a `TextView` then `textAlignment=viewStart` would not be required. I assumed wrapped text in RTL compatibility mode showing up as left aligned was just a problem with viewing in RTL compatibility mode, but if I add `textAlignment=viewStart` to a wrapped textView it suddenly fixes it.
