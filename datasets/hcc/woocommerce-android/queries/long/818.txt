**Describe the bug**

When I start on the My Store dashboard with a pending order, I can view that order (in the "You can 1 order to fulfill" section). However, I can't get back to the My Store dashboard from the order details screen.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Start with a pending order for your store.
2. Go to the "My store" dashboard.
3. Scroll down to the "You have 1 order to fulfill" section.
4. Tap on "View Order."
5. Note that there's no bottom tab navigation. Tap the device's back button to go back.
6. Result: The app closes instead of going back to the My store dashboard.

**Expected behavior**

I expected the back button to take me back to the My store dashboard. I also expected to see the bottom tab navigation, although I wouldn't have noticed it missing if the back button had worked as expected.
