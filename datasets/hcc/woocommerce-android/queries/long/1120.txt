We rely on `onDestroyView` throughout the app to drop views from the presenter and various other tasks. However, if a child fragment (such as order detail or add order note) is showing when a bottom nav tab is tapped other than the active one, `onDestroyView` (along with `onDestroy`, 'onStop`, etc.) aren't being called. It appears the fragment isn't destroyed until you return to the previously selected tab.
