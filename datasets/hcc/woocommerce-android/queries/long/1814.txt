**Describe the bug**
It's difficult to see, but there is a 1px vertical space along the right edge of the Reviews List view. I eventually figured out it was being added by the `UnreadItemDecoration`, but haven't figured out why it's happening. It's easier to see in dark mode which is why it was only now discovered.
