**Describe the bug**

If I change the status on one or more orders, and then open the Orders search, the list of status filters shows an outdated count for orders with that status. The count isn't updated until the app is relaunched.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to the Orders section.
2. Check the count for Processing orders on the Orders badge.
3. Tap the search icon and note that the count next to Processing matches.
4. Go to the Processing tab in Orders and fulfill an order.
5. Note that the Orders badge count is updated (decreased by 1).
6. Tap the search icon and note that the count next to Processing is unchanged.
7. Close and relaunch the app, and note that when you tap the search icon the count next to Processing is updated to match the Orders badge count.

**Screenshots**

I started with 13 Processing orders, and then fulfilled one order.

The Orders badge count correctly reflects the updated number (12):

The count for the Processing status filter still shows the old number (13):

**Expected behavior**

I expect the count on the status filters to update when an order changes status.
