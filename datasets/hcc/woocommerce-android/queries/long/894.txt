**Describe the bug**
Had several users report that stats have stopped refreshing. Even if the pull to force a refresh, the only way they will see current stats is if they logout and log back in.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Manually change the device date to yesterday.
2. Install the app and log in.
3. Stats should load in the "My store" tab.
4. Manually change device date to today.
5. Force a refresh - notice stats still not refreshing.

**Expected behavior**
User sees stats for yesterday and today
