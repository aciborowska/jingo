**Describe the bug**

If a product shows up in my Top Performers list but was refunded, the "total orders" and "total spend" for the product appear as negative values instead of 0 even if both the purchase and refund happened in that time period (so the net performance was 0 orders and 0 spend).

**To Reproduce**

1. Receive orders for a product, putting it in your Top Performers section. (I happened to see this on a day where I had orders for only 3 different products, so all 3 products were Top Performers for the day.)
2. Refund the orders for that product.
3. Check My Store > Top Performers in the app and notice the negative values for total orders and total spend on that product.

**Expected behavior**
I expect the orders and spend to be 0 (matching WC Admin), at least if the order and the refund happened in the same time period. (Ultimately I wouldn't really expect a product that only had refunds to appear in the top performers section, but that might require changes in WC Admin as well since it also appears there.)
