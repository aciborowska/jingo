The `ORDER_OPEN` tracks event was being called by the `OrderListPresenter` when a request was processed to open the order detail. This class was deleted in [PR 1559](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/1559), and it doesn't look like the track event was ported over with the new logic. This track event needs to be added back in.
