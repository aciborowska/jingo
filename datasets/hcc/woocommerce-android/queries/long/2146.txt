This [PR](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/2138) introduced a bug where selecting a shipping class did not display the discard dialog. I had initially thought it was in `develop` as well but after some debugging found that this was because we are storing a copy of the product when a product fragment is entered. 

So when user enters the `ProductShippingFragment` a new copy of the product is created. Now when shipping class field is clicked, user enters `ProductShippingClassFragment`, which also creates a new copy of the product. When a new shipping class is selected, we are redirected back to the `ProductShippingFragment` and since a new product copy is now created _with the updated shipping class_, the discard dialog is no longer displayed.
