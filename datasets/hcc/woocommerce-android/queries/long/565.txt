When navigating the app, if you have a list of orders or notifications that is so short that no scrolling is needed and then open the detail and scroll enough to hide the navbar, then click back -- the navbar is missing and there is no way to get it back until you get back to a screen that can scroll. 

## To Reproduce
1. Open the orders list for a site that only has a few orders so the orders list view does not scroll.
2. Click on an order to open the detail
3. Scroll enough to hide the navbar
4. Hit "back"

Notice the navbar is gone and you can't get it back.
