**Describe the bug**

My "All Orders" tab is not updating at all. I see older orders (orders I received before updating to app version 4.0-rc-1) but no new orders.

I confirmed that new orders do appear on the Processing tab, but as soon as the order is fulfilled it disappears from that tab (as expected). I checked the All Orders tab before and after fulfilling the order, and it never appears on that tab.

I noticed this issue sounds similar to https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/issues/1952, but it happens even though my store and my device are in the same timezone.

**To Reproduce**

1. Receive a new order on your store.
2. Open Orders > Processing tab and confirm the order appears there.
3. Open the All Orders tab and notice the order does not appear there.
4. Pull to refresh the screen and notice the order still does not appear there.
