### Expected behavior

Orders with `scheduled-payment` Order Status should not appear in `Today` Orders View.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

1) Download [WooCommerce Deposits](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-deposits/) extension.

2) Create a **Payment Plan** as follows:

3) Create a product and assign the Payment Plan to it in **Deposits** section:

4) Place an order for that product on the site. Select `Deposit` and `Payment Plan` upon placing item to the cart:

5) Once the order is placed, you should have the initial order for the item for which you paid the deposit + 3 orders that are visible in the **Payment Plan** section. The 3 orders should have a status `scheduled-payment`. In my case, it looks like this since I placed initial order on June 22, 2018:

**Payment Plan (has 2 orders but your view will have 3):**

**Order 1179 (Payment 4) - payment scheduled for December 22, 2018 - FUTURE DATE:**

6) Open the app and you will see that orders that are a part of the Payment Plan and have `scheduled-payment` Order Status appear in `Today` Orders View when they have future date as an Order Date.

These orders will be appearing every day in `Today` Orders View section. I tested it for several days and they keep moving. 

Ideally, I think we should hide them until they are "placed" (go through as per Payment Plan) and will be actually relevant for `Today` view. 

### Tested in WooCommerce iOS App?

Yes. Same issue is present there.
