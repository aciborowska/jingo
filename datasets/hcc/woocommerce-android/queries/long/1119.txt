If "don't keep activities" is enabled and the app is minimized when a child fragment is shown, the child fragment's title is incorrect when the app is restored. This happens in the order detail and add order note fragments.

What's needed here is a consistent way for child fragments to change the activity's title, similar to how we do it in `TopLevelFragment`. While we're at it, we should add a consistent way to change the close icon.

**Update:** This should be tackled as part of the migration to the navigation component.
