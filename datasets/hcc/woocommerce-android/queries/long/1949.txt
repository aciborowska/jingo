**Describe the bug**

If I had the overflow menu (Settings/Help) open the last time I used the app, and then I tap a push notification to open the app again, the push notification takes me to the correct place in the app (a new order or review)â€” but a blank overflow menu appears on screen.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Tap the overflow menu to open it (to see the Settings/Help & support options)
2. Background the app or lock your device screen.
3. Create a new order or review on your store.
4. Tap the push notification for the new order/review when it arrives.

Result: The overflow menu stays open but appears blank.

**Expected behavior**

I would expect the overflow menu to close when I'm taken to the new screen from the push notification.
