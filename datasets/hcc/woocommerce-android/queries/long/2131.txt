**Describe the bug**

If I navigate between tabs in the bottom nav bar while editing a product (before updating that product), my product edits are lost.

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to app Settings > Beta features > enable Products.
2. Go to the products tab.
3. Select a product to open the product details.
4. Edit any of the product details (title, description, price, etc).
5. Tap any of the other bottom nav tabs: My store, Orders, Reviews.
6. Tap the products tab again and notice you're back on the products list.
7. Select the same product and notice that your previous edits are gone without warning.

**Expected behavior**

I expect that I'll never be able to discard my product edits without warning. A couple ways I could imagine this working:

* The bottom nav could be hidden while I'm editing a product, so I can't navigate to another tab until I close the product details.
* If I try to navigate to another tab while editing a product, I could get the "discard changes" warning.

**Mobile Environment**
Please include:
- Device: moto e5 play
- Android version: 8.1.0
- WooCommerce Android version: 3.9-rc-1
