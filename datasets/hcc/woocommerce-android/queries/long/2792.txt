**Describe the bug**

I see the `Virtual product` setting in the Product settings for any product type in the app. I can toggle that setting for any product, but it doesn't do anything unless I'm editing a simple product.

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to Settings > Beta features and enable Product Editing.
2. Go to the Products tab.
3. Select a simple product from the product list.
4. Open the product settings and toggle the Virtual Product setting. Notice that in the product details, this changes the product type between Physical and Virtual.
5. Go back to the product list and select a variable product.
6. Open the product settings and toggle the Virtual Product setting. Notice that nothing happens to the product details (in the app or remotely).

**Screenshots**

**Expected behavior**

The `virtual` setting is only available for simple products in core, so I only expect to see that setting for simple products in the app. Other product types (variable, grouped, external) don't have that setting at the product level. (Variable products, for example, have a `virtual` setting for each variation but not for the product as a whole.)

**Mobile Environment**
Please include:
- Device: moto e5 play
- Android version: 8.1.0
- WooCommerce Android version: 4.9-rc-1
