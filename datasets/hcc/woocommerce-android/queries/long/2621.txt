**Describe the bug**

Searching orders for an order number only works if you search for the plain order number (e.g. `123`). The search doesn't return any results if you prefix the order number with a `#` symbol (e.g. `#123`).

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Open the Orders tab.
2. Tap the search icon to start a search.
3. Search for an existing order number, such as `123`.
4. Verify the search results show that order.
5. Search for the same order number with the `#` symbol included in the search, such as `#123`.
6. Notice that the search doesn't have any results.

**Expected behavior**
Since we show the order numbers in the Orders list with the `#` symbol as a prefix, we should also be able to handle searching for orders with the `#` as a prefix.

**Mobile Environment**
Please include:
- Device: moto e5 play
- Android version: 8.1.0
- WooCommerce Android version: 4.6-rc-3
