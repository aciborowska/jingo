**Describe the bug**

When you choose to log in with your self-hosted site credentials, the "Lost your password?" link doesn't work. Instead, when you tap on it a toast message pops up with this error:

> Unable to open the link

Based on the error messages, the link is malformed: If I enter the site address `example.com` it tries to open the lost password link at `example.comwp-login.php?action=lostpassword`.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open the app while logged out, and select Log In.
2. Enter the URL for a WooCommerce store with Jetpack connected.
3. Select the option to "log in with site credentials."
4. On the site credentials screen, select "Lost your password?" and note the message that appears.

**Expected behavior**

I expect the app to open the correct lost password page for my site. (I confirmed that this works as expected if I go through the WordPress.com credentials flow and use the lost password link for WordPress.com.)
