**Describe the bug**
When editing the product details, the "discard changes" dialog that's displayed if the user wants to quit the screen without confirming their changes is not displayed in some screens.
The cases I found are: categories list, and it impacts also the downloadable files screen (PR: #2730)

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open product details screen.
2. Open categories list.
3. Make some changes.
4. Click on "Add Category", and then go back.
5. Click on the arrow to quit the screen, you won't see the dialog warning about the changes.

**Screenshots**

**Expected behavior**
The user should be warned about their changes, and have the option to keep editing, or discard them.

**Technical analysis**
The decision to show the "discard changes" dialog is based on the comparison of `productDraft` and `productBeforeEnteringFragment` fields of the viewmodel, as `productBeforeEnteringFragment` is updated in `onViewCreated`, its value is changed when the user comes back from the "Add category" screen.
To solve the issue, updating `productBeforeEnteringFragment` should be moved to a method that's called once in the fragment lifecycle (`onCreate` for example).
