**Describe the bug**

Scenario: During login, when I log in with a password I have to switch between the Woo app and my password manager app to get the password.

Bug: If I switch between apps during login, and tap the WooCommerce app icon on my home screen to return to it (instead of using the app switcher), it resets the app to the prologue screen so I have to start over with the login process.

**To Reproduce**

1. Start logged out.
2. Select a login method and proceed until you have the option to enter a password.
3. Open a password manager app to get your account password.
4. Close the password manager app.
5. Tap the WooCommerce app icon on your device home screen (or if it isn't on your home screen, select it from your app list, not using the app switcher).
6. Notice the app opens on the Prologue screen instead of the screen where you left off in step 2.

I noticed it works as expected if I switch apps using the app switcher, but for whatever reason I have the habit of tapping the Woo app icon on my home screen in this scenario and expect it to work the same way.

**Mobile Environment**
Please include:
- Device: moto e5 play
- Android version: 8.1.0
- WooCommerce Android version: 5.1-rc-1
