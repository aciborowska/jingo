**Describe the bug**

When I open the Woo app, switch my device language, and then reopen the app, all of the app content refreshes with my new device language except the page title. The page title retains the original device language until I switch to another tab and back again.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open the app and confirm all of the text reflects your current device language.
2. Open the Settings app and change the device language.
3. Open the app and wait for the screen to refresh.

Result: The title retains the original language while the rest of the app refreshes to the newly selected device language.

**Expected behavior**

I expect the entire app to refresh with the new device language at the same time.
