**Describe the bug**

When I change a product's inventory settings, the stock status looks right on the inventory details screen but not in the Inventory section on the product details screen. Things that can be incorrect there:

* When `Manage stock` is disabled, the `Stock status` setting isn't shown in product details.
* When `Manage stock` is enabled, the `Stock status` setting isn't shown on the inventory settings screen but it does appear on the product details screen. That can lead to conflicting information (e.g. a positive stock quantity but also an "Out of stock" status).

I think the correct behavior is:

* If `Manage stock` is disabled, the `Stock status` setting should be shown in product details.
* When `Manage stock` is enabled, the `Stock status` setting shouldn't be shown in product details.

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to the Products tab.
2. Select a product.
3. Select Inventory.
4. With `Manage stock` disabled, set the `Stock status` to "Out of stock."
5. Enable `Manage stock` and enter a quantity (e.g. "10").
6. Tap "Done" and check the Inventory section. Notice that it now says "Stock status: Out of stock" but also "Stock quantity: 10."
