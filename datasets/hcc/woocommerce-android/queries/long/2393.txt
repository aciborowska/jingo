**Describe the bug**

When adding tracking information to an order (on the Add Tracking screen), changing the shipping date to a longer date string can result in the date being cut off.

**To Reproduce**

0. Ensure the Shipment Tracking extension is active on your store.
1. Go to the Orders > Processing tab.
2. Open an order detail.
3. Select "Begin Fulfillment."
4. On the Fulfill Order screen, scroll down to Optional tracking information and select "Add Tracking."
5. On the Add Tracking screen, notice that the "Date shipped" field shows the current date.
6. Change the "Date shipped" date to a longer date string (e.g. from `1 May 2020` to `28 September 2020`).
7. On the Add Tracking screen, notice that the "Date shipped" field no longer shows the full date; it is cut off on the right side.
