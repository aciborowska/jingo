**Describe the bug**
If a user logs in, logs out, then logs back in, there is a really high chance that the notifications tab will be empty and it will remain empty even after a force refresh (pull to refresh). The only fix currently is to uninstall and reinstall the app.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Log in to the app
2. Click the notifications tab. Notifications should download and display.
3. Log out. 
4. Log back into the app with the same user and pick the same store.
5. Click the notifications tab -> there is a high chance it will be empty.

**What's going on?**
The issue is with how the `NotificationModel` is designed to use the `local_site_id`. When the user logs out and logs back in, the sites are all redownloaded and a different `local_site_id` is assigned, but the `NotificationModel` table still contains all the original records assigned to the original `local_site_id`, so the client is not able to retrieve those records.
