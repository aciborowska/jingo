I was testing login and noticed I had to be an admin to get access to the stats data. Any other role ~(including shop manager)~ (shop manager currently supported) resulted in “no data available” on the Dashboard. 

The response I got for the stats request is below:

`{"code":"woocommerce_unauthorized_access","message":"User is not allowed to access this site","data":{"status":400}}`

### TODO
This should either be corrected on the server side, or we should display a message on the Dashboard stating the user doesn't have the required role to access stats.
