While working on the Dashboard, I noticed an interesting bug. [This `isVisible` check](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/blob/ef82efa2ac077cb5eb9ae0c55ee6d59e85c4de47/WooCommerce/src/main/kotlin/com/woocommerce/android/ui/orders/OrderListFragment.kt#L78) is never `true` if the fragment is the one initialized along with `MainActivity`.

To reproduce it in current `develop`, set `ORDERS` as the default fragment instead of `DASHBOARD`. The order list is always blank when opening the app.

The reason that check is there is to avoid doing initialization actions like network calls from top-level fragments if we're resuming the app with a child fragment on top of the top-level fragment.

Perhaps we can solve this by instead relying on the `childFragmentManager` to tell us the visibility state of the top-level fragment (maybe `backStackEntryCount == 0`)? WDYT @AmandaRiu?
