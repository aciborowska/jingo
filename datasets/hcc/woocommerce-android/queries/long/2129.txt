**Describe the bug**

I saw the app review prompt and selected "Later." Then, after taking just a few actions in the app (at most a few minutes later) I saw the app review prompt again. This was much earlier than I expected, although I'm not sure what the exact expected wait time is.

**To Reproduce**

I'm not sure how to trigger the rating prompt initially, but here's how I reproduced the issue after that:

1. When the app review prompt appears, choose "Later."
2. Open the app settings.
3. Go to Beta features and enable products.
4. Go back to the My store screen and notice that the prompt appears again. Choose "Later."
5. Open the app settings.
6. Go to Beta features and disable products.
7. Go back to the My store screen and notice that the prompt appears again. Choose "Later."
8. Rotate the screen to landscape and notice that the prompt appears again. Choose "Later."
9. Rotate the screen back to portrait and notice that the prompt appears again.

**Expected behavior**

I expect that choosing "Later" will dismiss the app review prompt for a longer period of time.

**Mobile Environment**
Please include:
- Device: moto e5 play
- Android version: 8.1.0
- WooCommerce Android version: 3.9-rc-1
