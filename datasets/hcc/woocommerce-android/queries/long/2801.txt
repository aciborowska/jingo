**Describe the bug**

After changing an order's details (e.g. adding an order note or issuing a refund) the Products section disappears from the order details screen. If I try to pull to refresh the screen at that point, I see loading indicators but it never stops loading.

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to the Orders tab and select an order.
2. Confirm the order details screen includes all the expected information.
3. Go to the order notes section and add a note.
4. Scroll back up and notice the Products section (including the Begin Fulfillment button) is gone.
5. Pull to refresh and notice the screen never loads.
