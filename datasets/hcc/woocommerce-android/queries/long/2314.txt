**Describe the bug**

The "Limited editing available" banner persists on the Product search screen. It works fine with product search results, but if there are no search results the banner overlaps the "We're sorry, we couldn't find results for X" message.

**To Reproduce**

1. Open the Products tab.
2. Tap the search icon to search products. Notice the "Limited editing available" banner is visible.
3. Search for a product in your store. Notice the banner appears above the results.
4. Search for a non-matching keyword. Notice the banner overlaps the "no results" message.
