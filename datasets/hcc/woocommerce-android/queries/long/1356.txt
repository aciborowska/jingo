**Describe the bug**
“Cannot connect to..” error message can still happen despite the new login flow and on that screen "view connected sites" and "try another account" buttons don’t work

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Credentials in 2285617-zen
2. Enter site URL and login credentials
3. See the "cannot connect to.." error message
4. It is possible to press the physical Android "Back" key but if the app is closed and re-opened - that doesn't work anymore and the only way to get out of that screen is to re-install the app.

**Expected behavior**
"View connected sites" and "try another account" buttons should still work.
