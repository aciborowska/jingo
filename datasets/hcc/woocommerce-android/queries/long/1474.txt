While testing this [PR](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/pull/1472), I noticed that the order list item is not clickable once a user clicks the back button from the order detail page when an order item is selected from the order status filter list.

### To Reproduce
- Click on the search icon in `My Orders` tab.
- Click on any one of the statuses such as `Refunded`.
- Click on an order item from the list of refunded items.
- Click back from the Order detail screen.
- Click on another item from the order list and notice that it is not clickable.
