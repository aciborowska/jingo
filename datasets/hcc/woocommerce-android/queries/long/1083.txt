**Describe the bug**
When I pull to refresh the Orders list and switch tabs before it finishes loading, whatever tab I load (Notifications or My store) switches to the Orders title.

I noticed this when I switched tabs immediately after opening the app, while the content was still loading, but I can reproduce it consistently by pulling to refresh the order list.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to the Orders list.
2. Pull to refresh the Orders list.
3. Before the list content finishes loading, switch to Notifications.

Result: After a moment, the "Notifications" title switches to say "Orders."
