**Describe the bug**

If I add shipment tracking without a tracking link (i.e. only the shipping provider and tracking number) I still see a link icon on the shipment tracking in the app. Tapping on the link icon does nothing.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Add Shipment Tracking to your store.
2. Add a tracking number to an order, but don't enter a tracking link.
3. Open the order details for that order in the app.
4. Tap the link icon next to the tracking details.

**Expected behavior**

I expect shipment tracking without a tracking link to appear in the app, but without the link icon. Here's how the same tracking appears on iOS:

**Isolating the problem (mark completed items with an [x]):**
- [x] I have deactivated other plugins and confirmed this bug occurs when only WooCommerce plugin is active.
- [x] This bug happens with a default WordPress theme active, or [Storefront](https://woocommerce.com/storefront/).
- [x] I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above.

**Mobile Environment**
Please include:
- Device: moto e5 play
- Android version: 8.1
