### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
4.0.0-RC2
### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-JDBC
### Expected behavior
when the anyone distinct column value is null,can return normal result
### Actual behavior
will throw NullPointException
### Reason analyze (If you can)
org.apache.shardingsphere.core.execute.sql.execute.row.QueryRow#isEqualPartly line 69 
if the distinct column value is null,will throw NullPointException,
if the rowData.get(i)==null, i think should continue
### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.
``` sql
SELECT DISTINCT sa.aid, sa.avatar_Url, sa.birthday, sa.create_time, sa.curr_address, sa.degree, sa.email,
        sa.gender, sa.height, sa.identity_no, sa.identity_type, sa.image_id, sa.image_type, sa.image_url, sa.mark_info,
        sa.married, sa.nation, sa.occupation, sa.person_name, sa.phone_no, sa.source_type, sa.sys_code, sa.thumbnail_url,
        sa.update_time, sa.last_appear, sa.last_thumbnail_id, sa.event_count, sa.event_day_count
        FROM
                t_skynet_archive sa
        LEFT JOIN t_skynet_archive_label_relation salr ON sa.aid=salr.aid
```
anyone distinct column value is null will throw NullpointException
