### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
 3.1.0.M1  and 3.1.0 
### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-JDBC
### Expected behavior
hint strategy will work ok  for every table in my project.
table:order_item  selcect„ÄÅupdate operate  can hit expect table 

### Actual behavior
table:order_item_goods_out  insert\update can hit expect table but .select operate cannot hit expect table. 
### Reason analyze (If you can)
I don't understand this, the hint strategy is used in the same way in different tables but in fact the execution is different in different tables
### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.




### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
