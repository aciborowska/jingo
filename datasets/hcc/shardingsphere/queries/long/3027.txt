## Bug Report

### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?

4.0.0-RC2

### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?

Sharding-JDBC

### Expected behavior

Get `tinyint` type column value from results is `integer` type for MySQL

### Actual behavior

Get `tinyint` type column value from results is `byte` type for MySQL

### Reason analyze (If you can)

ShardingSphere will getByte in `QueryResultUtil` for tinyint type column,
But the tinyint type get from native JDBC getObject is `Integet` type.

Same as `small int` type. I also test `small int` type for DB2, PostgreSQL, all return `Integet` type from native JDBC getObject.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.

### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
