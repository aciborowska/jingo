### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
4.0.0-RC2
### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-JDBC
### Expected behavior

### Actual behavior
With SpringBoot2.x and Oracle11g, We will get a SQLStntaxErrorException: table or view does no exsit. After research, we get the ShardingSphere will scan the all tables in the Oracle DB(XE) and analyze these tables, but the DB account can't be had all privileges. So, occurred error, the spring boot can't be startup.
### Reason analyze (If you can)
ShardingJDBC version 3.x don't scan the all table, so it can be startup, but 4.x does not start
### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.

### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
