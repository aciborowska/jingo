Sharding-jdbc
version:4.0.0-RC1
my logical sql 
delete Goods from goods AS Goods WHERE Goods.goods_id   <=   ?

However sharding-jdbc replace alias and the table name totally, just like this
delete goods_1 from goods_1 AS Goods WHERE Goods.goods_id   <=   ?
this will execute error in mysql 5.6

One solution is to change to another alias different table name, but this may difficult for me. What else should I do?
