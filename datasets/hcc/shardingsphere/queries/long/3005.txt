project: sharding-proxy
version: v3.1.0 & v4.0.0-RC2

question:
when i use navicate to connect sharding-proxy, and do double-click the table(any table), it can load all the datas but just threw the errors like "There is no primary key here. Update will only use exact matching of the old values of the columns here. Thus, it may update more than one record."
