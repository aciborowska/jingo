Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
sharding-proxy : 4.0.0-RC3-SNAPSHOT

Expected behavior
When update one record, update success and return response number '1'

Actual behavior
When update one record, update success and return response number '0'

My configure is the same as #3555, and update process is :
String sql_update ="UPDATE t_encrypt SET content = xxx where pwd = xxx";
int num = statement.executeUpdate(sql_update);
