### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
4.0.0-RC4-SNAPSHOT
### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Both
### Expected behavior
Performance stable after merge https://github.com/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/pull/3541
### Actual behavior
Performance declined
### Reason analyze (If you can)
` 
DataSourceMetaData dataSourceMetaData = databaseType.getDataSourceMetaData(new DataSourceInfo(metaData.getURL(), metaData.getUserName()));
`

metaData.getUserName() will send a query: **select user()**. This additional SQL will be sent in each query and apparently influence the performance.
### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.
All scenarios when execute an SQL.
### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
