before start this issue , I already ensure the binlog sync mode is ROW , and test table has PK

1. insert some test data into  table `source_schema.test`
2. start sharding scaling, and post the `scaling/job/start` request
3. scaling start to sync the inventory data , this works well
4. during scaling sync the inventory data , try to update one of the data in `source_schema.test` , such as `update test set amount = amount +1 where id = 123`
5. wait for a moment , all inventory data have been transtered to new sharded database through proxy, but the update change doesn't work

I grant the root user all privileges , and config root user in proxy.I'm not sure if there is any other configuration for database or proxy I should set up ?

I tried insert data ,during the inventory sync , if insert some new data , these could be sync to sharded part , but update data does't work
