we have used a singleton `ParsingResultCache` which key is prepared logic-sql to cache the SQLStatement. if the sharding-rule of the logic-sql have changed, or access the same logic-sql from multi-sharding-datasources, we will get an unexpected SQLStatement which sharding-condition is wrong. so we should cache the parsed SQLStatement within lifecycle of `ShardingContext`.

- [x] Using ParsingResultCache in ShardingContext
- [x] resolve memory leak for hash map
