## Bug Report

### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
   3.0.0.M1
### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-JDBC 
### Expected behavior
correct sort by designated column,or when cannot surpport throw exception inform  user ï¼Ÿ

### Actual behavior
multi-result can not correct sort by designated column

### Reason analyze (If you can)
 i see the encapsulate select columns is map  and map's key from columnLabel,so the same column will be overwrite  ,when  setIndexForOrderItem(columnLabelIndexMap, orderByItems);  orderby column   will  find  error index ,so that result sort is wrong .i use alias with different table same column name and order by their alias can get a right result


### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.
SELECT
        i.user_id  ,o.user_id 
        FROM
        t_order o, t_order_item i
        WHERE
        o.order_id = i.order_id
        order by i.user_id
