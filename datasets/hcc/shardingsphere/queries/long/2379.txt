When I upgrade sharding-jdbc version to 4.0.0-RC1, the SQL: `delete from user where id=“xx” `cannot execute correctly, but it is ok in sharding-jdbc 3.0.0.
The log is:
> line 1:12 no viable alternative at in input 'fromuser'
Actual SQL : ds_0 ::: delete from user where id=’xx‘ .

The SQL should be written to `delete from user_5 where id=“xx” .`

I debug this problem and found that AntlrSQLParser can't parse table-names accurately when parsing. I try to delete  USER kerword definition  in Keyword.g4 and rebuild , then the SQL can execute  correctly.

> USER 
           : U S E R
           ;

So I think there may be some mistakes in the antlr .g4 files when SQL table name is 'user'.
