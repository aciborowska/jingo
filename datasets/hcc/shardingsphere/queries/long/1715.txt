### update
it looks like a driver compatibility problem with `mysql-connector-java` of 6.0.6 or above
the issue title should updated in some days
---
i just use database sharding not table sharding, but when Logic table have the same name as Actual table, some error occurs
``` 
Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: Column name pattern can not be NULL or empty.
```
here is my config of yaml
```yaml
shardingRule:
  tables:
   # same name as Actual table， but when i use ms_ds${1..2}.t_user1, it will be ok
   # but when i change table name in mysql to t_user1，then ms_ds${1..2}.t_user1 does not work either
    t_user:
      actualDataNodes: ms_ds${1..2}.t_user
      databaseStrategy:
        inline:
          shardingColumn: id
          algorithmExpression: ms_ds${id % 2 + 1}

      keyGeneratorColumnName: id
```

i think it may be a bug
