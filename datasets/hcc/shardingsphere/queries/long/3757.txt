# Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
4.0.0-RC3
### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
sharding-jdbc
### Expected behavior
execute sql:
insert into demo(channel, name) values ('xx', 'xx') 
report error:
no viable alternative at input '(channel'
### Actual behavior
Insert record faild
### Reason analyze (If you can)
'channel' seems to be the keywords of sql parsing

sql:
insert into demo(channel, name) values ('xx', 'xx')
