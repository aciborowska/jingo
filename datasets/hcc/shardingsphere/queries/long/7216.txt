### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
4.1.0

### Which project did you use? ShardingSphere-JDBC or ShardingSphere-Proxy?
ShardingSphere-JDBC 

### Expected behavior

select id, icon, title, subtitle, notifyIndex, url, type, pushTime,params
        from t_sys_message sm
        where delFlag = 0 and pushStatus = 1 and uid in (#{uid}, 0)
        and id not in (select mid from t_del_message dm where dm.uid = #{uid})
        order by pushTime desc
        limit #{page.start}, #{page.pageSize}

### Actual behavior

### Reason analyze (If you can)
If there is a "not in" subquery, there will be problems

### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.
