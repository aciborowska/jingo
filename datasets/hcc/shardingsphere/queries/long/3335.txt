For example, the sql is:

```
SELECT t_account.password FROM t_account WHERE t_account.account_id = 1 AND t_account.password = 'aaa'
```

if `t_account` is a sharding table which need to rewrite to `t_account_1`, and `password` is a encrypt column which need to rewrite to `password_cipher`, the SQL can not be processed correct when sharding and encrypt use together.
