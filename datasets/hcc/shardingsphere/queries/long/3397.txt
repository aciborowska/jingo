Sharding-Proxy
### Expected behavior
execute SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'lower_case_%' sql and return right result.
### Actual behavior
throw NullPointerException
### Reason analyze (If you can)
`QueryHeader.java` throw this exception in 70 line. the `TableMetas` doesn't contains `VARIABLES` table, so the program throw NullPointerException.
This problem case in this PR #3379 , and I will fix it right now.

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'lower_case_%'
### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
