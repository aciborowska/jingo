### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?

5.0.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT

Both

### Expected behavior

Correctly rewrite the following SQL:

```
SELECT SUM(order_id) AS orders_sum, user_id as `key` FROM t_order GROUP BY `key`
```

### Actual behavior

The logical SQL is rewritten to:

```
Actual SQL: ds_0 ::: SELECT SUM(order_id) AS orders_sum, user_id as `key` , `key` AS GROUP_BY_DERIVED_0 FROM t_order_0 GROUP BY `key` ORDER BY `key` ASC 
Actual SQL: ds_0 ::: SELECT SUM(order_id) AS orders_sum, user_id as `key` , `key` AS GROUP_BY_DERIVED_0 FROM t_order_1 GROUP BY `key` ORDER BY `key` ASC 
Actual SQL: ds_1 ::: SELECT SUM(order_id) AS orders_sum, user_id as `key` , `key` AS GROUP_BY_DERIVED_0 FROM t_order_0 GROUP BY `key` ORDER BY `key` ASC 
Actual SQL: ds_1 ::: SELECT SUM(order_id) AS orders_sum, user_id as `key` , `key` AS GROUP_BY_DERIVED_0 FROM t_order_1 GROUP BY `key` ORDER BY `key` ASC 
```

Lead to MySQL server respond error:
