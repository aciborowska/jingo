### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
4.0.0.M1-SNAPSHOT

### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-JDBC

### Expected behavior
order_id use SNOWFLAKE algorithm, which is the table sharding-colum.
`INSERT INTO t_order (user_id, status) VALUES (?, ?) ` should be routed to
t_order_0 or t_order_1

### Actual behavior
route to t_order_0 and t_order_1

### Reason analyze (If you can)
OptimizeEngine haven't make autogen sharding-column as `ShardingCondition`

### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
