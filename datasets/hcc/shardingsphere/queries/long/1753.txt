## Bug Report

**For English only**, other languages will not accept.
SQL: 
```
SELECT COUNT(1) FROM ( 
     SELECT
        r.`channel` as `channel_code`,
        r.`channel_name` as `channel_name`,
        COUNT(r.id) `total_cnt`,
        COUNT(r.connect_flag = "Y") `connected_cnt`
        FROM record_callin r
        LEFT JOIN sys_org_tree_rel tree ON tree.teamid = r.teamid
        LEFT JOIN sys_user u ON u.brokerid = r.brokerid
        where
        r.create_time between '2018-01-01 00:00:00' and   '2019-01-01 00:00:00'
        GROUP BY 
        r.`channel` 
) TOTAL
```
hope to support it
