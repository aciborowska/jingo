## Bug Report

### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
Sharding-Proxy 4.0.0-RC3-SNAPSHOT

### Expected behavior
When we use IDE, such as Navicat, we can execute the selected SQL by clicking 'Run Selected', but if nothing is selected at the time, the proxy will occur NullPointerException.

As Expected, it should not go wrong

### Reason analyze (If you can)
In SQLParserEngine.parse() method, when the SQL is empty, the ParseTree will be null, and then 
occurs the exception.
