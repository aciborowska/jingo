### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
4.1.1

### Which project did you use? ShardingSphere-JDBC or ShardingSphere-Proxy?
ShardingSphere-Proxy

### Expected behavior
config-wms.yaml:
shardingRule:
  defaultDatabaseStrategy:
    standard:
      shardingColumn: tenant_id
      preciseAlgorithmClassName: com.hrsoft.sharding.strategy.core.DatabaseStrategy
  tables:
    databasechangeloglock:
      actualDataNodes: wms_base.databasechangeloglock
      databaseStrategy:
        none:
      tableStrategy:
        none:
    databasechangelog:
      actualDataNodes: wms_base.databasechangelog
      databaseStrategy:
        none:
      tableStrategy:
        none:



### Actual behavior
Table 'wms_sd1.databasechangelog' doesn't exist
some times its ok,so i think the "DatabaseStrategy" got wrong


### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.
springliquibase:
SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM `databasechangelog` FROM `sharding_wms` LIKE '%'

### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
