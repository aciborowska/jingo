3.0.0.M2

### Which project do you using? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?

Both

### Expected behavior

Can start up when using oracle

### Actual behavior

Got exception:

```
Caused by: groovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: INTERNET_USERS for class: Script776
```

### Reason analyze

Oracle has lots of system tables, and some tables contains "$" as table name. When Sharding-Sphere to evaluate inline expression, cannot parse table name with "$".
