The data packet may be empty in some scenarios, for example, the login password is empty.

I'm not sure it is correct  as the follow modification(replace `>=` with `>`) 

```java
    @Override
    public boolean isValidHeader(final int readableBytes) {
        return readableBytes >= MySQLPacket.PAYLOAD_LENGTH + MySQLPacket.SEQUENCE_LENGTH;
    }
```
