## Question

I am using the sharding-proxy, the PreparedStatement setString, I set the field to be null object not the 'null' string, the sharding-proxy will treat it as a string to be inserted into table,which is not my expected result is also not the same as in jdbc.
for the pagination, it is not support the sql like  'limit 20 offset 0' ;only support the 'limit 0,20'. if this limit offset statement can be supported in the future?
