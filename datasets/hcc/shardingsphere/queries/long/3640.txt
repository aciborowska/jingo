### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
4.0.0-RC4 compile by myselft from the source code
### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-Proxy
### Expected behavior
read the timestamp value from sharding-proxy should contains the milliseconds
### Actual behavior
miss the milliseconds when reading from sharding-proxy
### Reason analyze (If you can)
maybe there is type converstion or byte read bug in sharding-proxy?
### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.
Just any database client tools to connect to the proxy to select query a reacord with timestamp values with milliseconds in real database tables
### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
just a very easy select statement test can reproduce this issue.
this is the followup testing after the issue #3550 fixed by #3632
