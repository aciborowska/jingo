### Which version of Sharding-Sphere did you use?
sharding-proxy-3.0.0
### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-Proxy
### Expected behavior
return ```y```
### Actual behavior
return ```Empty set```
### Reason analyze (If you can)
If parser finds queries like 'show tables from x like y', proxy should firstly match tables in sharding configs before sending these queries to real db.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.
execute:
```SHOW [FULL] TABLES FROM `x` LIKE 'y'; ```
while y is a sharing table consisting of y0,y1,y2..

### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
