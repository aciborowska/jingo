Before report a bug, make sure you have:

- Searched open and closed [GitHub issues](https://github.com/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/issues).
- Read documentation: [ShardingSphere Doc](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/overview).

Please pay attention on issues you submitted, because we maybe need more details. 
If no response **more than 7 days** and we cannot reproduce it on current information, we will **close it**.
