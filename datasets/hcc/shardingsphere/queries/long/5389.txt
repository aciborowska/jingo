## Bug Report

### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
4.1.0
### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
sharding-scaling

### Expected behavior
I have a table, it's primary key's type is bigint.
when the scaling fetch the primary key range, it use rs.getInt() rather than rs.getLong(),  which cause  Integer overflow.
Proof:
org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingscaling.core.synctask.history.HistoryDataSyncTaskGroup line 141-142

### Actual behavior

### Reason analyze (If you can)

### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.
when the primary key's value is bigger than Integer.MAX
