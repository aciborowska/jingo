### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
dev branch: 4.0.0-RC3-SNAPSHOT
### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
sharding-orchestration
### Expected behavior
Tests that rely on `AUTHENTICATION_YAML` inside [ConfigurationServiceTest](https://github.com/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/blob/48ad82f690e59c4690fca936096b1149558a3880/sharding-orchestration/sharding-orchestration-core/src/test/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/orchestration/internal/registry/config/service/ConfigurationServiceTest.java) should pass regardless of the HashMap iteration orders.
### Actual behavior

Tests can fail if the order changes

### Reason analyze (If you can)
Currently, `YamlAuthenticationConfiguration.java` and `Authentication.java` are using HashMap to map users. However, HashMap does not guarantee any specific order of entries.
Therefore the string version of `Authentication` objects do not always match `AUTHENTICATION_YAML` as expected by the tests. 


### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.

For examples, if `AUTHENTICATION_YAML` has `root2` comes before `root1` in the string, the tests would fail as iteration order is not same as the input.

[ERROR]   ConfigurationServiceTest.assertPersistConfigurationForShardingRuleWithAuthenticationAndIsOverwrite:190
Argument(s) are different! Wanted:
regCenter.persist(
    "/test/config/authentication",
    "users:
  root2:
    authorizedSchemas: sharding_db
    password: root1
  root1:
    authorizedSchemas: sharding_db,ms_db
    password: root2
"
);
-> at org.apache.shardingsphere.orchestration.internal.registry.config.service.ConfigurationServiceTest.assertPersistConfigurationForShardingRuleWithAuthenticationAndIsOverwrite(ConfigurationServiceTest.java:190)
Actual invocation has different arguments:
regCenter.persist(
    "/test/config/authentication",
    "users:
  root1:
    authorizedSchemas: sharding_db,ms_db
    password: root2
  root2:
    authorizedSchemas: sharding_db
    password: root1
"
);
```


### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
Changing `AUTHENTICATION_YAML` to have `root2` come first.
```
private static final String AUTHENTICATION_YAML = "users:\n" + "  root2:\n" + "    authorizedSchemas: sharding_db\n" + "    password: root1\n"
            + "  root1:\n" + "    authorizedSchemas: sharding_db,ms_db\n" + "    password: root2\n";
   ```
