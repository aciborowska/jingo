my logical sql
SQL: update cf_application_info
set phone=?,idNo=?
where applyNum = ?
the question is when i set phone and idN is the cipher column,and alter my table by adding phone_cipher,idNo_cipher column,i update my data,the result is phone_cipher has the plain data,and the phone column has the cipher data,this is strange and i think this is a bug.
