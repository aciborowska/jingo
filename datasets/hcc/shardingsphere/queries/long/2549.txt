### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
4.0.0-RC2-SNAPSHOT

### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-JDBC & Sharding-Proxy

### Expected behavior
sharding-column: debitacc
`insert into journal (flowdate,amount,state,debitacc,creditacc) values (curdate(),1,'0', ?, ?)"`

and this sql `insert into bill (flowno, flowdate, account_no, debitamount, credityield, customer_no) values (?, curdate(), ?, 1, 0, ?)` will be routed to all datanode, sharding-column is customer_no
