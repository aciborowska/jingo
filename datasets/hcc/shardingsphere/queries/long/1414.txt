### Which version of Sharding-Sphere did you use?
3.0.0
### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-Proxy
### Expected behavior
Sharding-Proxy execute "SHOW CREATE TABLE ...," return correct result
### Actual behavior
return “table doesn't exist”
### Reason analyze (If you can)
The SQL of "SHOW CREATE TABLE " judge result is "ShowOtherStatement", so  it execute with error schema by schema unicast  handler.
### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.

### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
