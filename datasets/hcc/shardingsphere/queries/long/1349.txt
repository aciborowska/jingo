### Which version of Sharding-Sphere did you use?

### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?

Sharding-Proxy

### Reason analyze (If you can)

The registry can not watch changes from clients, if sharding proxy loads configurations from local. So it is necessary to modify some APIs of orchestration.
