### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
5.0.0-RC1

### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-Proxy

### Expected behavior
Use master-slave rule, execute SQL `select * from t_order` return correct result.

### Actual behavior
Can't return result and burst warnings.
```
mysql> use master_slave_db;
Database changed
mysql> select * from t_order_0;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 25971 warnings (3 min 40.86 sec)
```

### Reason analyze (If you can)
The first packet Sharding-Proxy returned is an EOF packet, that means column definition packets lost. 
Debug in the codes, I found queryHeader size is 0. queryHeader  is obtained from meta data, master-slave mode doesn't read the meta data.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.
Config a master-rule and execute the SQL like `select * from`.

### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
