I have reproduced the behavior as @lvye351 says in #5383. The keyGenerator doesn't work in the transaction-2pc-xa-raw-jdbc sample module when a oracle database 12c and ojbdc8.jar used.

It seems that when table t_order created, its tableMetaData doesn't put into schemaMetaData.
I will try to find out the reason and fix it.
