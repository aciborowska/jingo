### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
shardingsphere-4.0.0-RC2-1

### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-Proxy

### Expected behavior
insert a timestamp value into table with milliseconds

### Actual behavior
insert a timestamp value into table without milliseconds

### Reason analyze (If you can)
I think maybe related to the Timestamp long construtor in sharding-proxy ? or btm jdbc (but when insert to my db without proxy, it works perfect,so this should not be the cause)???
### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.
I am using bitronix tm in my application, just a normal simple insert sql with timestamp value with milliseconds in PreparedStatement. and my client os is windows 10 with Zulu openjdk 1.8.0_232. And the sharding-proxy is in Ubuntu 18.04 with Oracle jdk 1.8.0_211 and MySQL5.7
