At present, SQL case below could not work well when using new parser, and the reason is that `ON t_order.order_id` is not managed.
```
 <sql-case id="select_inner_join_related_with_name" value="SELECT t_order_item.* FROM t_order JOIN t_order_item ON t_order.order_id = t_order_item.order_id WHERE t_order.order_id = ?" />
```
Here is the excpetion,
```
org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Column "t_order.order_id" not found; SQL statement:
SELECT t_order_item_0.* FROM t_order_0 JOIN t_order_item_0 ON t_order.order_id = t_order_item.order_id WHERE t_order_0.order_id = 1000 [42122-196]
```
