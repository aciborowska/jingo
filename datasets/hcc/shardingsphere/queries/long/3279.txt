I configured read-write separation to make an error while executing the update statement, which contains case when.

For example, SQL statement: UPDATE OTS_ORDER SET UPDATE_DATE = now (),STATE = (CASE WHEN (STATE is null) THEN 1 ELSE STATE+1 END)

The error message is as follows:
  Org.antlr.v4.runtime.tree.TerminalNodeImpl cannot be cast to org.antlr.v4.runtime.ParserRuleContext
