### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
4.0.0-RC2-SNAPSHOT

### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-Proxy

### Reason analyze (If you can)
Throw an exception when call `DistinctQueryResult.getColumnIndex()` with `SelectItems.getColumnLabels()` result. Cause `SelectItems.getColumnLabels()` return `expression` like `table.column`, but there is a map with `column` in `DistinctQueryResult`.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.
Try to sql like this.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT book.name FROM book;
```

### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
You can find this situation in https://github.com/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/issues/2715.

### Steps to solve the issue.
- [x] add `getColumnLabel()` in `SelectItem`
- [x] overwrite `getColumnLabel()` in `SelectItem`'s subclass
- [x] modify constructor in `SelectItem`'s subclass
- [x] replace `getExpression()` with `getColumnLabel()` on some where should get columnLabel
- [x] add UT for this
