As #7002 mentioned, if there is a wrong SQL parsed result,  which means SQL definitions do not cover the inputted SQL. No exception is thrown up but only some error info in log.

We have to consider fixing this issue since it is the SQL Parser engine's responsibility to warn users that the inputted SQL does not fit the SQL definitions.
