## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
```
{
  "schemaVersion": "0.1",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "A"
    }
  ],
  "rules": [
    {
      "rule": "Rule 1",
      "constraints": [
        {
          "anyOf": [
            {
              "field": "A",
              "is": "equalTo",
              "value": 1
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Expected Result:
The schema validation should pick up that "anyOf" must have at least two children and give a suitable error.

### Actual Result:
```
* Error(s) occurred during schema validation.
