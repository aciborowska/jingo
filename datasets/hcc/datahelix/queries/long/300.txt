## Bug Report
An if request with a containing regex constraint in the if statement of the request was run. Not all combinations of results were returned.

> Scenario: Running an if request that contains a non contradictory containingRegex constraint within its if statement should be successful
>      Given the following fields exist:
>        | foo |
>        | bar |
>        And foo is in set:
>          | "1"  |
>          | "2"  |
>          | "a1" |
>          | "b2" |
>        And foo is anything but null
>        And bar is in set:
>          | "10" |
>          | "20" |
>          | "AA" |
>          | "BB" |
>        And bar is anything but null
>        And there is a constraint:

>          {
>          "if": { "field": "foo", "is": "containingRegex", "value": "[1]{1}" },
>          "then": { "field": "bar", "is": "equalTo", "value": "AA" },

>          }
>        """
>      Then the following data should be generated:
>        | foo  | bar  |
>        | 1    | "AA" |
>        | 2    | "10" |
>        | "a1" | "AA" |
>        | "b2" | "10" |

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run feature file if.feature
2. See that scenario **Scenario: Running an if request that contains a non contradictory containingRegex constraint within its if statement should be successful** fails
3. Look at the error to see that one of the expected combinations [a1, AA] is missing from the output.

### Expected Result:
All valid combinations of data should have been produced in line with the if statement, resulting in the following:

>      | foo  | bar  |
>      | 1    | "AA" |
>      | 2    | 10   |
>      | "a1" | "AA" |
>      | "b2" | 10   |

### Actual Result:
The test fails with an error message as below that shows data row | "a1" | "AA" | is not generated.

> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: [1, AA], [2, 10], [a1, AA], [b2, 10]
>      but: [a1, AA], [1, AA], [b2, 10], [2, 10]
>  missing: [1, AA], [2, 10]
>   counts: expected 4, but got 4
