## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a simple profile
2. generate random data for the given profile

### Expected Result:
Velocity should show 'finished' or a calculation of rows/sec for the entire generator run when the generator has completed generation, rather than 0 as is hard coded at present 

### Actual Result:
```
$ java -jar generator.jar generate --max-rows=100 --overwrite profile.json output.csv
Generation started at: 08:02:52
 Number of rows | Velocity (rows/sec) | Velocity trend
---------------+---------------------+---------------
100            | 0                   | - 
```
The given velocity is zero. I have generated 100 rows in <1 sec, so I expect the velocity to be > 100

### Environment:
> ...version and build of the project, OS and runtime versions, virtualised environment (if any), etc. ...
erm ... beta? MacOS, java version "1.8.0_91", ...


### Additional Context:
> ...add any other context about the problem here. If applicable, add screenshots to help explain...
