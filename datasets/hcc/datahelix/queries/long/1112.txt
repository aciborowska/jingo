## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
Run in normal generation mode:
```
{
  "schemaVersion": "0.1",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "Column 1"
    }
  ],
  "rules": [
    {
      "rule": "Rule 1",
      "constraints": [
        {
          "not": {
            "field": "Column 1",
            "is": "ofType",
            "value": "integer"
          }
        },
        {
          "not": {
            "field": "Column 1",
            "is": "null"
          }
        },
        {
          "field": "Column 1",
          "is": "equalTo",
          "value": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

### Expected Result:
Hard contradiction - No data should be produced.

### Actual Result:
1 can be produced.

### Notes:
Arguably, the current behaviour is correct because integers are a subset of real numbers (decimals). It needs to be decided whether this behaviour should be kept or changed.

This issue raises a few questions:
1) Should decimals include integers?
2) Should "equalTo" imply a type? If so, how would the difference between a decimal 1 and an integer 1 be specified?
3) Should explicit/static typing be forced for every field? For example, by forcing each field to have one and only one type when the field is declared at the top of the profile.

Replacing "integer" with "decimal" in the profile doesn't allow any data to be generated.
