## Bug Report

In generate mode, when generation is completed a `Generation finished at: ...` is output to standard error by default.  In violate mode, it is not.

 1. Run any profile in violate mode without the `-q` option.

### Expected Result:
A `Generation finished at: ...` message to be output to standard error when generation has completed.

### Actual Result:
No such message is output.
