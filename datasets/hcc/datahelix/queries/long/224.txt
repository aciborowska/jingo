## Bug Report
When the output was specified to be non-null and picked from a set including null, null was present in output

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Run feature file null.feature from the branch null-initial
 2. See failed tests include **Negating the 'null' operator generates non-null values**
 3. Open error report for failing scenario to see the actual results include unexpected values.

### Expected Result:
Null should not be present in the output.

### Actual Result:
```
java.lang.AssertionError: 
Expected: [null]
     but: [null], [notNull]
   found: [null]

	at âœ½.the following data should not be included in what is generated:(C:/dev/data-engineering-generator/generator/src/test/java/com/scottlogic/deg/generator/cucumber/Null.feature:19)
```


### Environment:
local, null-initial branch, IntelliJ

### Additional Context:
Callum suggested 'inSet' may be casting null to a string.
