## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
run `generate` on a profile with `--visualise-reductions` and `--violate`

### Expected Result:
`reductive-walker` directory created containing Graphviz dot files.

### Actual Result:
generation runs but no `reductive-walker` directory is created.

### Additional Context:
documentation does not specify that these two switches cannot be used together.
either update the documentation to specify that these switches are incompatible, or allow visualisations in violate mode.
