## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
Run the `ExampleProfilesViolationTests` test fixture

### Expected Result:
It should:
1. Run generate and generation-violating data for both
1. Check the validity of the profile when reading it

### Actual Result:
1. The tests always exercise the violation generation engine, never the standard one
1. The file `a-valid-isin` is invalid since #431 but the tests do not fail.
