## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the generator in violation mode providing an output path that doesn't exist
1. Run Violation.feature adding `And the walker type is REDUCTIVE` to the `Background`

### Expected Result:
Generation should abort early, neither data files nor manifest are created

### Actual Result:
Message is printed stating that manifest file could not be created, generation continues and fails when writing to the first output file.

See try..catch in `IndividualRuleProfileViolator`.

### Additional acceptance criteria
- [x] Remove try..catch where the message is printed to allow the exception to bubble out, this shouldn't be reached because of the changes in #566 therefore this complexity should be removed.
- [x] Cucumber should not emit any files to disk when running Violation.feature with the reductive walker
