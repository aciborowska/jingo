## Bug Report
The test expects a value of 2018-10-10 but an error message on running the test says that no item matches 2018-10-10. This is the value of the Before or At so it appears that the generator is not creating the At value (which is expected to behave as an equal to).

> Scenario: User requires to create a temporal field with date (YYYY-MM-DD) values within a given month that are less than or the same as a specified date
>      Given there is a field foo
>        And foo is before or at 2018-10-10T00:00:00.000
>        And foo is after 2018-10-01T00:00:00.000
>        And foo is anything but null
>        And foo is of type "temporal"
>        And foo is formatted as "%tF"
>      Then the following data should be generated:

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run feature file BeforeOrAt.feature
2. See failed Tests include **Scenario: User requires to create a temporal field with date (YYYY-MM-DD) values within a given month that are less than or the same as a specified date**
3. Open error report for failing scenario to see that the expected value of 2018-10-10 is not matched.

### Expected Result:
The expected value of 2018-10-10 is created by the data generator and matched against, passing the scenario.

### Actual Result:
Error message shows that 2018-10-10 is created but not matched against.
