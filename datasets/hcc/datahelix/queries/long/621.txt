## Bug Report
A profile was written to match a regex of [a-j]{1} but was further constrained to not match a regex of [1-b]{1}. Although the generator creates the expected data, the test still fails unexpectedly.

> Scenario: Running a 'matchingRegex' request with a not constraint should be successful
>      Given foo is matching regex /[a-j]{1}/
>        And foo is anything but matching regex /[a-b]{1}/
>        And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
>      Then the following data should not be included in what is generated:
>        | foo  |
>        | "c"  |
>        | "d"  |
>        | "e"  |
>        | "f"  |
>        | "g"  |

### Steps to Reproduce:
- Run the above test or the MatchingRegex.feature suite
- See that the scenario **Scenario: Running a 'matchingRegex' request with a not constraint should be successful** fails
- Review the error message that is returned for the failed test

### Expected Result:
The data generator should create the values from regex a-j without a or b:
       | foo  |
       | "c"  |
       | "d"  |
       | "e"  |
       | "f"  |
       | "g"  |

### Actual Result:
The test fails with an error that indicates that it cannot find the expected data, but this is what has been produced:

> Testing started at 13:42 ...
> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: [c], [d], [e], [f], [g]
>      but: [c], [d], [e], [f], [g]
>    found: [c], [d], [e], [f], [g]

### Environment:
Run on IntelliJ in full generation mode.
