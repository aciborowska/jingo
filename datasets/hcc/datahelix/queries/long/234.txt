## Bug Report
When the `ofLength` argument included non-zero decimal places the argument is floored. I.e. the value 2.9 will generate data of length 2.

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Run feature file OfLength.feature from the branch ofLength-initial
 2. See failed tests include **Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a decimal number including non zero digits should fail with an error message**
 3. Open error report for failing scenario to see the actual results include unexpected values and no error.

### Expected Result:
I am presented with an error message and no data is created

### Actual Result:
No error message is presented. Data is generated as though the length argument had been floored.

### Environment:
local, ofLength-initial branch, IntelliJ

### Additional Context:
none
