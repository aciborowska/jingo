## Bug Report
An if request was created with a matchingRegex constraint added to the then statement that contradicted the predefined field's inSet values. This was expected to fail with an error when run, but did not.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run if.feature file from cucumber tests
2. See scenario **Running an if request that contains a contradictory matchingRegex constraint within its then statement should fail with an error message** fails
3. Look at error message generated for the failure

### Expected Result:
Test should pass as a contradicting statement should result in the user getting an error message

### Actual Result:
Test fails as no error is created for the failing constraint run:

> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: is &lt;true&gt;
>      but: was &lt;false&gt;
