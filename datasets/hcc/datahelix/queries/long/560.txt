## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Change IoC to provide `ReductiveIterationVisualiser` instead of `NoOpIterationVisualiser`
 1. Generate some violating data from a profile

### Expected Result:
A `reductive-walker` directory should be created within the output path specified for the violation output files.

### Actual Result:
A `reductive-walker` directory is created in the parent path for the violation output files.

i.e. if `c:\generator-output` is provided as the output path for the violation data.
The violation data files (CSV's) will be created as `c:\generator-output\1.csv` and so on.
The `reductive-walker` directory will be created as `c:\reductive-walker` and all visualisation files will be found here.

The `reductive-walker` directory should be created as `c:\generator-output\reductive-walker`.
If this mode was used when `c:\` was provided as the output path, the code would throw and error and generation would abort, inappropriately.

### Additional Context:
- This mode should be configurable from the command line, it is currently hard-coded and requires a rebuild to enable it.
