This problem happens when both:
* A field has a regex with a wildcard character e.g. `.*` (also used with shorterThan which gets translated into `.*{0,n}`
* `-t FullSequential` is used

The string generator tries to output non-printable characters which causes an exception in the csv reader. This doesn't happen with interesting values because we limit the output to printable characters.
