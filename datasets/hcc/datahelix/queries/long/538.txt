## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Corrupt a test in the schemas package (e.g. `ProfileSerialiserTests`)
 2. Run the 'test' lifecycle event in the schemas maven lifecycle

### Expected Result:
The test should be reported as a failure

### Actual Result:
The test does not appear to be run, and therefore doesn't show a failure.
The tests are not run as part of our PR checks either therefore we're not benefiting from them as part of our PR reviews.
