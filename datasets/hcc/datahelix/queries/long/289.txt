## Bug Report
An if statement was run that included an else ofType = numeric. It was expected that all numeric options for the field (from the set specified) would be created, however some were not.

> Scenario: Running an if request that contains a non contradictory ofType constraint within its else statement should be successful
>      Given the following fields exist:
>        | foo |
>        | bar |
>        And foo is in set:
>          | 1   |
>          | 2   |
>          | "a" |
>          | "b" |
>        And bar is in set:
>          | 10   |
>          | 20   |
>          | "AA" |
>          | "BB" |
>        And there is a constraint:
>        """
>          {
>          "if": { "field": "foo", "is": "equalTo", "value": "a" },
>          "then": { "field": "bar", "is": "equalTo", "value": "AA" },
>          "else": { "field": "bar", "is": "ofType", "value": "numeric" }
>          }
>        """
>      Then the following data should be generated:
>        | foo | bar  |
>        | 1   | 10   |
>        | 1   | 20   |
>        | 2   | 10   |
>        | 2   | 20   |
>        | "a" | "AA" |
>        | "b" | 10   |
>        | "b" | 20   |

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Create a test as per the above that includes an if statement with an else ofType condition (or run the if.feature test file).
2. See that the test (or **Scenario: Running an if request that contains a non contradictory ofType constraint within its else statement should be successful**) fails
3. Check the error message to see that not all available combinations were created.

### Expected Result:
In full data generation strategy mode all combinations of fields should be created as per the expected outcome of the test above.

### Actual Result:
The test fails with an error indicating that some possible values that meet the constraints were not generated:

> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: [1, 10], [1, 20], [2, 10], [2, 20], [a, AA], [b, 10], [b, 20]
>      but: [1, 20], [1, 10], [2, 20], [b, 20], [a, AA]
>  missing: [2, 10], [b, 10]
>   counts: expected 7, but got 5

### Environment:
ifTestsUpdated branch running in full generation strategy on IntelliJ.
