## Bug Report
A request was created for a soft contradiction where date should be generated for before and not before a date. The app generated the date as valid data, which contradicts both constraints applied.

> Scenario: 'before' run against a contradicting not 'before' should only only generate string, numeric and null
>      Given foo is before 2019-01-01T00:00:00.000
>        And foo is anything but before 2019-01-01T00:00:00.000
>        And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
>      Then the following data should be generated:
>        | foo                     |
>        | null                    |

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Run the above scenario in cucumber (or run the before.feature on branch 309-before-CI)
 2. See that the scenario **Scenario: 'before' run against a contradicting not 'before' should only only generate string, numeric and null** fails
 3. Review the error related to this failed test

### Expected Result:
Because of the soft contradiction, only null can be created.

### Actual Result:
The test fails and the error message shows that that the date 2019-01-01T00:00:00.000 is created:

> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: [null]
>      but: [2019-01-01T00:00:00.000], [null]
>  missing: 
>   counts: expected 1, but got 2
