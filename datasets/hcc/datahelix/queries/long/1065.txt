## Bug Report

At present, if the rules for a field contains no assertions as to whether null is required or prohibited from a field, then the output for that field includes nulls in both generation and violation modes.

This is unintuitive and should be changed so that the output includes nulls in generation mode, but does not include nulls in violation mode.

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Write a profile with the following content:

```
{
  "schemaVersion": "0.1",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "X" }
  ],
  "rules": [
    {
      "constraints": [
        { "field": "X", "is": "ofType", "value": "integer" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Run the above profile in violation mode.

### Expected Result:
Data that contains a variety of non-integer data in the single field in the output, none of which is null.

### Actual Result:
The output contains data that includes a variety of non-integer values, but also includes null.
