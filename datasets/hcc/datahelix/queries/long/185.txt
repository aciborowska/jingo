## Bug Report
Equal to test for a temporal field is failing with no specific error message:

> Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' request that includes a date value (not a string) should be successful
>      Given there is a field foo
>        And foo is equal to 2010-01-01T00:00:00.000
>      Then the following data is generated:
>        | foo                                    |
>        | 2010-01-01T00:00:00.000 |

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run feature file EqualTo.feature
2. See failed Tests include **Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' request that includes a date value (not a string) should be successful**
3. Open error report for failing scenario to see that no error message is referenced.

### Expected Result:
This test should have passed as the asserted value 2010-01-01T00:00:00.000 matched the equal to input of 2010-01-01T00:00:00.000.

### Actual Result:
The test fails with no error messages or skipped steps. The time of the run is 0ms.

### Environment:
Master Branch running on IntelliJ.
