## Bug Report

Check after #322 is completed.

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. When running generateTestData with a very large profile (100+ rules), and only generating 3 rows of data per file using the reductive walker, we get 1 file of data for every rule that is supposed to be violated. 
 2. Turning tracing on, we can see which rule has "violated":"true"
 3. Check if every file contains violated data.

### Expected Result:
Every file has a violation.

### Actual Result:
Not every file had violated data. - A plausible explanation for this is that the 3 rows of data omitted were insufficient to trigger generation of violated data (as currently we generate valid alongside violated data). This raises a question whether valid data should be generated alongside violated data. Additionally we are doing further work on the way violations are generated in #322 which might impact on this so once this is completed, we need to confirm that violating data is generated for every rule.
