## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
The run the following profiles with the command `java -jar generator.jar generate --max-rows=100 --replace profile.json output.csv`

[profile-1.txt](https://github.com/ScottLogic/datahelix/files/2984263/profile-1.txt)
[profile-2.txt](https://github.com/ScottLogic/datahelix/files/2984264/profile-2.txt)

### Expected Result:
Both attached profiles should output the same data.

### Actual Result:
Outputs do not match. 
profile-1.txt works as expected with the second column always populated when the first column is greater or equal to 16. 
When running profile-2.txt the second column is populated for some rows when the first column is less than 16, it should be blank in this case, and the second column is blank for some rows when the first column is greater than 16. The regex constraint is ignored for the second column for most rows with the text `Lorem Ipsum` outputted instead.

### Environment:
Release V0.0.5
