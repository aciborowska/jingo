## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
run generation with

--violate
--trace-constraints


### Expected Result:
trace file produced that is helpful?
trace file tells which constraints have been violated.

### Actual Result:
Lots of information about default values is produced (length < 1001)

no constraint is shown to be violated
