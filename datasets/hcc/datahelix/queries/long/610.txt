## Bug Report
A scenario was run to validate that the use of an invalid leap year date would result in an error. However, this did not error as expected.

> Scenario: Running a 'before' request that specifies an invalid leap year should be unsuccessful
>      Given foo is before 2019-02-29T00:00:00.000
>        Then the profile is invalid
>      And no data is created

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. run the above scenario (or run before.feature file from branch 309-before-ci)
 2. See that the scenario errors
 3. Review the error for the failed test

### Expected Result:
The test should pass as the profile is invalid and the expected result matches this.

### Actual Result:
The test fails with the following error message:

> java.lang.AssertionError: Expected invalid profile
> Expected: a collection containing (((is an instance of com.scottlogic.deg.generator.inputs.InvalidProfileException or is an instance of com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException) or is an instance of java.lang.IllegalArgumentException) or is an instance of java.lang.ClassCastException)
