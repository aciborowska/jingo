## Bug Report
An if request was run that included a granularTo. It was expecting that all values would meet the if > then statement so only one set of data would be emitted; however data is emitted for both the if > then and if > else statements.

> Scenario: Running an if request that contains a non contradictory granularTo constraint within its if statement should be successful
>      Given the following fields exist:
>        | foo |
>        | bar |
>        And foo is in set:
>          | 10 |
>          | 20 |

>      Then the following data should be generated:

>        | 10  | 1   |

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the above test (or the if.Feature file)
2. See that scenario **Running an if request that contains a non contradictory granularTo constraint within its if statement should be successful** fails
3. Look at error message to see duplicate entries are created for both the then and else conditions.

### Expected Result:
Data is emitted only for the then condition as all entries meet the granularTo 1
**[10, 1], [20, 1], [30, 1], [40, 1]**

### Actual Result:
.Data for both the then and else conditions are created and the test fails as per the below error message:

> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: [10, 1], [20, 1], [30, 1], [40, 1]
>      but: [20, 1], [40, 1], [10, 1], [30, 1], [20, 333], [40, 333], [10, 333], [30, 333]
>  missing: 
>   counts: expected 4, but got 8

### Environment:
IntelliJ running ifTestsUpdated branch with full generation / exhaustive combination.

### Additional Context:
Test set to @ignore
