## Feature Request

### Description of Problem:
Before this merge https://github.com/ScottLogic/data-engineering-generator/commit/4ea4f663e59894df879d4439f4ef9bccab58fd93

The nulls were usually being generated first.
However with small profiles, they would sometimes generate in nulls last order

E.g. with this cucumber scenario

	    Scenario: Running a 'matchingRegex' and 'inSet' request nulls are generated last
    Given there is a field bar
    And the combination strategy is exhaustive
    And foo is matching regex /[a-b]{1}/
    And bar is in set:
      | "AA" |
      | "BB" |
    Then the following data should be generated in order:
      | foo  | bar  |
      | "a"  | "AA" |
      | "b"  | "AA" |
      | null | "AA" |
      | "a"  | "BB" |
      | "b"  | "BB" |
      | null | "BB" |
      | "a"  | null |
      | "b"  | null |
      | null | null |
