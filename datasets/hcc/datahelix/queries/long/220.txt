## Bug Report
Submitting an in set request that includes an invalid time or date should result in an error as the invalid date shouldn't be parsed. However, no error results.

> Scenario: Running an 'inSet' request that includes an invalid date value should fail with an error message
>      Given there is a field foo
>        And foo is in set:
>        | 2010-13-40T00:00:00.000 |
>        | 2017-12-31T23:59:59.999 |
>      Then I am presented with an error message
>        And no data is created
