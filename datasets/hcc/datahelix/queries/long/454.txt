## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Navigate to C:\Users\<user>\.m2\repository\com\scottlogic\deg
 2. Delete the contents of the folder (parent, generator, schemas and profiler)
 3. In IntelliJ run the Maven install for schemas
 4. In IntelliJ run the Maven install for generator

### Expected Result:
Generator finds the output jar for schemas and uses this to build and install generator successfully.

### Actual Result:
Install fails for generator with the message:
```
Failed to execute goal on project generator: Could not resolve dependencies for project com.scottlogic.deg:generator:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT: Failed to collect dependencies at com.scottlogic.deg:schemas:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT: Failed to read artifact descriptor for com.scottlogic.deg:schemas:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT: Could not find artifact com.scottlogic.deg:parent:pom:1.0-SNAPSHOT -> [Help 1]
```

### Additional Context:
This seems to be related to the main parent install. When this runs by itself the install is successful. In fact as soon as the parent metadata file exists any of the installations can be run independently. We do not want to have to run the parent install before running an individual install if you just want to use the generator for example.
