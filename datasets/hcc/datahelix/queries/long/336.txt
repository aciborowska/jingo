## Bug Report
An if request was made where the then statement included a shorterThan constraint. The data generated for this did not contain the expected values for the true path of the if > then statements.

> Scenario: Running an if request that contains a non contradictory shorterThan constraint within its then statement should be successful

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run if.feature file from cucumber tests
2. See **Scenario: Running an if request that contains a non contradictory shorterThan constraint within its then statement should be successful** fails
3. Look at error message generated for the failure to see not all expected data has been generated

### Expected Result:
The data from the Then > Else part of the if statement should be generated (i.e [ccc, 1], [ccc, 22] ).

### Actual Result:
The data from the Then > Else logic has not been created, resulting in an error of the test:

> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: [a, 333], [bb, 333], [ccc, 1], [ccc, 22], [dddd, 333]
>      but: [bb, 333], [a, 333], [dddd, 333]
>  missing: [ccc, 1], [ccc, 22]
>   counts: expected 5, but got 3
