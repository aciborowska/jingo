## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Run the generator in violate mode on a profile containing multiple rules, saving output to files.

### Expected Result:
The generator should output velocity results, with one measurement per second, separately for each violation file being produced.

### Actual Result:
The generator starts producing velocity results at one measurement per second, but as generation progresses the frequency of velocity measurements increases.  The interval between velocity measurements is not even.

### Additional Context:
I suspect what is happening is that a new velocity measurement thread is being created for each file output, but previous measurement threads are continuing to run and make measurements.
