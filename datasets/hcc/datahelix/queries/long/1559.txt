## Bug Report

The schema is currently out of date.

### Steps to Reproduce:
This is most easily visible by using the vscode plugin for schema validation. (found [here](https://github.com/finos/datahelix/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md#profile-validation))

### Expected Result:
Valid profiles should not fail schema validation.

### Actual Result:
The schema is invalid. 
Two instances of this I have noticed are the version number and the fact that "rules" is still expected. There may be additional fields which need to be updated.


As part of this ticket, a regression test should be added that checks that valid profiles do not fail schema validation.
