## Bug Report
If statements were written that include then and else statements for the value of the field to be equalTo a value that is not inSet for that field. It was expected that these statements should fail, but did not.

> Scenario: Running a 'if' request that includes an invalid then value (not in field set) should fail with an error message
>      Given the following fields exist:
>        | foo |
>        | bar |
>        And foo is in set:
>          | 1 |
>          | 2 |
>          | 3 |
>          | 4 |
>        And bar is in set:
>          | "a" |
>          | "b" |
>          | "c" |
>        And there is a constraint:
>        """
>          {
>          "if": { "field": "foo", "is": "equalTo", "value": 1 },
>          "then": { "field": "bar", "is": "equalTo", **"value": "X" },**
>          "else": { "field": "bar", "is": "equalTo", "value": "b" }
>          }
>        """
>      Then I am presented with an error message
>        And no data is created

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run if.feature set of cucumber tests
2. See that scenario **Running a 'if' request that includes an invalid then value (not in field set) should fail with an error message** fails
3. Review error message to see that expected failure does not occur.
4. See that scenario **Running a 'if' request that includes an invalid else value (not in field set) should fail with an error message** fails.
5. Review error message to see that expected failure does not occur.

### Expected Result:
Statements that contradict themselves should fast fail with an appropriate and meaningful error message.

### Actual Result:
The test fails as no error is generated:

> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: is <true>
>      but: was <false>

> 	at org.junit.Assert.assertThat(Assert.java:923)
> 	at com.scottlogic.deg.generator.cucumber.steps.GeneralTestStep.dataGeneratorShouldError(GeneralTestStep.java:88)
