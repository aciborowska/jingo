## Bug Report
When attempting to use a beforeField or afterField relation on fields with inSet constraints the following error is returned:
`java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: cannot combine sets with <before|after> relation, Issue #1489`
Some discussion of this from #1571 repeated below:

> 
> Before/after are more complicated, as theoretically each of the values
> must be translated to a range. This therefore means the result is a set
> of restrictions. Unfortunately, the system isn't designed to be passing
> around a set of restrictions at this time in the program. Therefore,
> this will take further thought.
> 
> A possible solution is to take the most restrictive of the values. This
> would ensure that whichever values are picked are permissable, but would
> severely limit the number of values output.
