## Bug Report

When running the reductive walker, it's process is:
for each field, fix the value, check this hasn't caused any contradictions.
Reduce the available options for the remaining fields to avoid future contradictions.

then moves onto the next field.

However, it does not do this for the final field.
Which was assumed to be safe, however it means it does not check for contradictions, so often generated invalid data.


### Steps to Reproduce:
Run the reductive walker on a suitably complex profile 
(there are some cucumber tests ignored with #756 that can be ran that demonstrate this)
Enable Iteration Visualisation

### Expected Result:
The tree reduces to just a single node with all the values fixed.

### Actual Result:
The tree doesn't reduce for the final field, and generated contradictory data.
