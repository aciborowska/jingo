## Bug Report

Using an inSet Constraint with weights appears to not be working correctly. The weights do not appear to have an effect on the frequency of items appearing.

### Steps to Reproduce:
Using the profile
```
{
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "a",
            "type": "string",
            "nullable": false
        }
    ],
            "constraints": [
                {
                    "field": "a",
                    "inSet": "weightedSet.csv"
                }     
    ]
}
```
Along with the csv file

```
"Hundred",100
"Ten", 10
"One",1
```

Run datahelix in random mode. Here are the command line arguments I used to run the profile:
```
generate
--max-rows=1000
--replace
--profile-file=C:\src\DataHelix\profile.json
--output-path=C:\src\DataHelix\out.csv
--output-format=csv
--generation-type=RANDOM
--set-from-file-directory=C:\src\DataHelix\
```

This can also be checked using a different weighted set & profile, such as the one in the examples.

### Expected Result:
"Hundred" should appear significantly more times than "One"

### Actual Result:
All three results appear with similar frequency.
