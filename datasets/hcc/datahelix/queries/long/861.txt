## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
Debug a profile run with the reductive walker in random mode with partitioning enabled

### Expected Result:
The related field tree partitioner is invoked

### Actual Result:
The noop tree partitioner is invoked instead

Random output should remain fully-random - see #888 
 
### Additional Context:
Partitioning is meant to be on by default

The reason this is the case is that tree partitioning does will emit the same data for all but 1 partition when in random mode.
