## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Define field foo as anything but `null`
 2. Set foo as granular to 1
 3. Set foo as in set with some numbers granular to one, some not (e.g. `1`, `1.1`)
 4. Generate Data

### Expected Result:
Should only output the numbers granular to 1 (`1`)

### Actual Result:
Outputs entirety of set (`1`, `1.1`)

### Additional Context
Covered by Null.feature Scenario: Not 'null' with a non contradicting 'granularTo' should be successful
