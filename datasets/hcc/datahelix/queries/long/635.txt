## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Specify a profile with a temporal field foo
2. Add a constraint for foo `before` a date (e.g `2019-01-01T00:00:00.000`)
3. Add a contradictory constraint for foo `anything but before or at` a later date (e.g `2019-01-02T00:00:00.000`)
4. Generate data

### Expected Result:
No data is produced

### Actual Result:
All datetimes are produced

### Additional Notes:
* Currently I don't think we have a standard way of handling contradictory merges that deals with this correctly
* Covered by cucumber scenario Before.feature Scenario: 'before' run against a contradicting not 'beforeOrAt' should only only generate string, numeric and null

```gherkin
Scenario: 'before' run against a contradicting not 'beforeOrAt' should only only generate string, numeric and null
     Given foo is before 2019-01-01T00:00:00.000
       And foo is anything but before or at 2019-01-02T00:00:00.000
       And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
     Then the following data should be generated:
       | foo                     |
       | null                    |
```

### Invesitgation
If you breakpoint the DateTimeRestrictionsMergeOperation and DateTimeRestrictionsMerger

DateTimeRestrictionsMerger will check to see if the min time is after the max time, and will return null

DateTimeRestrictionsMergeOperation will check for null, and will then return an empty dateTimeRestriction thus removing the datetime restrictions
