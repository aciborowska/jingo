## Bug Report
An If request was made across a field that includes a set of numeric and string values, when it was run not all valid combinations of fields were generated.

> Scenario: Running an if request that contains a non contradictory matchingRegex constraint within its else statement should be successful
>      Given the following fields exist:
>        | foo |
>        | bar |
>        And foo is in set:
>          | "1" |
>          | "2" |
>          | "a" |
>          | "b" |
>        And foo is anything but null
>        And bar is in set:
>          | "10" |
>          | "20" |
>          | "AA" |
>          | "BB" |
>        And bar is anything but null
>        And there is a constraint:
>        """
>          {
>          "if": { "field": "foo", "is": "equalTo", "value": "1" },
>          "then": { "field": "bar", "is": "equalTo", "value": "AA" },
>          "else": { "field": "bar", "is": "matchingRegex", "value": "[0-9]{2}" }
>          }
>        """
>      Then the following data should be generated:
>        | foo | bar  |
>        | "1" | "AA" |
>        | "2" | "10" |
>        | "2" | "20" |
>        | "a" | "10" |
>        | "a" | "20" |
>        | "b" | "10" |
>        | "b" | "20" |

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the test above (or run if.feature) where a matchingRegex was included as part of the if statement.
2. See that the test (**Scenario: Running an if request that contains a non contradictory matchingRegex constraint within its else statement should be successful**) fails.
3. See the error shows that expected values (where matchingRegex is not true) are not generated

### Expected Result:
Values that do not match the if statement should be generated alongside the value from the else condition.

### Actual Result:
Values that do not match the if statement are not created as seen in the error produced:
