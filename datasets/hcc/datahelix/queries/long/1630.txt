## Bug report

### Description of the bug
In #1628 a badly formed CSV lead to an error. The error was not very descriptive of the underlying problem. A user would not necessarily know what has gone wrong.

### Steps to reproduce:
Duplicate #1628.

### Expected result:
The error message should inform them that a given row in the file contains an unexpected number of comma-separated values, which represent the fields in the profile.
