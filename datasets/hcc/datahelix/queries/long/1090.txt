## Bug Report
### The Problem:
The `ReductiveTreePruner` is not able to prune all trees with hard contradictions. See #1087 for an example. It is not able to prune that tree at all. The general case seems to be to have two complex constraints, which are negations of each other, i.e. A and Not(A).

This is a problem because it is relied upon for contradiction checking. If a hard contradiction is not found by the pruner, then the profile could infinite loop. This is especially a problem during violation, because hard contradictions could be created for any allOf construction (including constraints next to each other, and rules) with two or more parts.
