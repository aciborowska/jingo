## Bug Report
An if request was made over an isValid ISIN constraint. The data generated for this request did not match expectations and seemed to ignore the then and else statements.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run the above tests (as part of the if.feature test file).
2. See that the test **Scenario: Running an if request that contains a non contradictory aValid constraint within its if statement should be successful** fails
3. Check the resulting error message to see that only ISIN data from field foo was generated against.

### Expected Result:
The if statement should take the aValid ISIN value from the foo set and match it to the value "22" in the bar set as per the if / then statements. All other values from the foo field set should be matches against the value "4444" as per the else statement.

>        | foo            | bar    |
>        | "GB0002634946" | "22"   |
>        | "bb"           | "4444" |
>        | "ccc"          | "4444" |
>        | "dddd"         | "4444" |

### Actual Result:
The system generates two roes of ISIN value for foo against both the then "22" and else "4444" values in the bar field.
