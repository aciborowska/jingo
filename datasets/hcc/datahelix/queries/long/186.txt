## Bug Report
Equal to test for a leap year temporal field is failing with an error message expecting a formatted date with no seconds or nanoseconds.

> Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' request that includes a date value (leap year) should be successful
>      Given there is a field foo
>        And foo is equal to 2020-02-29T00:00:00.000
>      Then the following data should be generated:
>        | foo                                    |
>        | 2020-02-29T00:00:00.000 |

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run feature file EqualTo.feature
2. See failed Tests include **Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' request that includes a date value (leap year) should be successful**
3. Open error report for failing scenario to see that expected result has removed seconds and nanoseconds for vampid temporal field format.

### Expected Result:
This test should have passed as the asserted value 2020-02-29T00:00:00.000 matched the equal to input of 2020-02-29T00:00:00.000.

### Actual Result:
Error message shows that expected result is not a valid temporal formatted value "<[2020-02-29T00:00]>":

> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: iterable with items [<[2020-02-29T00:00]>] in any order
>      but: not matched: <[2020-02-29T00:00:00.000]>
