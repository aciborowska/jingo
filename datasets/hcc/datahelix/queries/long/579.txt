## Issue Report

### Description
When violating a larger profile the run does not complete and typically gets halted at one of the fields. This is due to the fact that the simplifier and reductive strategy constantly creates a tree that cannot be resolved.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Run an example large profile (available internally - speak to @steve-tennantsl )

### Expected Result
The violation mode should be able to violate every rule in the profile and produce output files for each rule.

### Actual Result
The generator does not generate sufficient data to cover each rule after reasonable execution time (1 hour).

### Additional Information
A change is required to check for constraints that are to be simplified to ensure that they will not contradict with the root node. Also, currently the simplifier can cause duplicates in the parent node which should be addressed.

### Expected Consequences
Due to the fact that the simplifier can cause a contradiction with the parent node a check must be made for each constraint. This will cause a performance hit during generation and will affect both violation and regular generation.

### Work Required
- [x] Fix parent node contradiction
- [x] Fix duplication in the simplifier
- [ ] Create tests to prove the new behaviour
- [ ] Fix/Maintain existing tests for the reducer
