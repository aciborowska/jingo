## Bug Report
Profiles which contain hard contradictions (no data can be generated) only sometimes result in a warning when run. This can be seen in two of the examples: `hard-contradiction-type-validation-1` & `hard-contradiction-type-validation-2`.

This image shows two profiles with hard contradicitions being run. Only one of them results in the message 
>The provided profile is wholly contradictory!
>No data can be generated!

being shown.
