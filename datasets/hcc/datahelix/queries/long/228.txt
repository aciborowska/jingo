## Bug Report
an equalTo of "" was passed as a constraint for ofType temporal and numeric fields. In both cases a 0 was generated rather than an empty string.

> Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = numeric request that includes a null entry ("") characters should fail with an error
>      Given there is a field foo
>        And foo is equal to ""
>        And foo is of type "numeric"
>      Then I am presented with an error message
>        And no data is created

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run feature file ofType.feature
2. See failed Tests include Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = numeric request that includes a null entry ("") characters should be successful
3. Open error report for failing scenario to see the actual results include unexpected value of 0.
4.  See failed Tests include Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = temporal request that includes a null entry ("") characters should be successful
5. Open error report for failing scenario to see the actual results include unexpected value of 0.

### Expected Result:
an empty value or no data should be created.

### Actual Result:
Test fails as 0 value is generated. Error is shown:

> ava.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: []
>      but: 
>  missing: []
>   counts: expected 1, but got 0
