## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
Run test `shouldGenerateStringsInLexicographicalOrder` in `RegexStringGeneratorTests`  

### Expected Result:
The test passes

### Actual Result:
The test sometimes fails as the values produced are not in the right order. They should be produced in the order in which they are defined in the regex.

### Additional Context:
When producing non-random strings each state's transitions are sorted using `state.getSortedTransitions(boolean to_first)` and it looks like the issue is with this method sometimes returning transitions in reverse order.
