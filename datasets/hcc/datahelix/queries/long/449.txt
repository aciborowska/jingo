## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Run `generateTestCases` for a medium-large sized profile (20+ *rules*)
 2. Monitor the memory use of the application (by a process monitor or profiler)
 3. Note that memory use gradually (or in some cases drastically) increases over time

### Expected Result:
It is not unexpected that the process should consume more memory over time, but the process should largely be linear on its increase. 

### Actual Result:
Memory use gradually (or in some cases drastically) increases over time.
It gets to a point where the process exists due to an Out of memory exception, reporting "GC overhead limit exceeded".

### Additional Context:
Running on master as at 18/01/2019.
Upon initial inspection it appears to be down to repeated creation of `RegexStringGenerator` instances, moreover the `Automaton` instances which hold types which aren't being picked up by the garbage collector when the `RegexStringGenerator` is unreferenced.
This can be 'proven' by forcing a GC during the processing of the data, where memory consumption is reduced.
