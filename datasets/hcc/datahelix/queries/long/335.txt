## Bug Report
An if request was made where the then statement included a longerThan constraint. The data generated for this did not contain the expected values for the true path of the if > then statements.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run if.feature file from cucumber tests
2. See **Scenario: Running an if request that contains a non contradictory longerThan constraint within its else statement should be successful** fails
3. Look at error message generated for the failure to see not all expected data has been generated

### Expected Result:
The data from the Then > Else part of the if statement should be generated (i.e [bb, 333], [bb, 4444] ).

### Actual Result:
The data from the Then > Else logic has not been created, resulting in an error of the test:

> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: [a, 333], [a, 4444], [bb, 333], [bb, 4444], [ccc, 333], [ccc, 4444], [dddd, 1]
>      but: [dddd, 1], [bb, 333], [bb, 4444], [a, 333], [ccc, 333]
>  missing: [a, 4444], [ccc, 4444]
>   counts: expected 7, but got 5
