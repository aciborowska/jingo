## Bug Report
A basic before profile was run via cucumber in full generation mode, but failed as interesting style data was created.

> Background:
>      Given the generation strategy is full
>        And there is a field foo
>        And foo is of type "temporal"
> 
> Scenario: Running a 'before' request that specifies a valid date should be successful
>      Given foo is before 2019-02-10T00:00:00.000
>        And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
>      Then the following data should be generated:
>        | foo                     |
>        | 2019-02-09T23:59:59.999 |
>        | 2019-02-09T23:59:59.998 |
>        | 2019-02-09T23:59:59.997 |
>        | 2019-02-09T23:59:59.996 |
>        | 2019-02-09T23:59:59.995 |

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create the above test within a cucumber feature file (or run the test from the before.feature from branch)
2. See that the test errors
3. Review the error message to see unexpected outputs

### Expected Result:
Exhaustive outputs should be generated for time periods before 2019-02-10T00:00:00.000 at the lowest granularity:
>        | 2019-02-09T23:59:59.999 |
>        | 2019-02-09T23:59:59.998 |
>        | 2019-02-09T23:59:59.997 |
>        | 2019-02-09T23:59:59.996 |
>        | 2019-02-09T23:59:59.995 |

### Actual Result:
Only a subset of values, that look like how interesting would generate, were created as per the error message displayed.
