## Bug Report
A before request was made for 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000 and it appears the generator looped round for that year, as it created a value of 0001-12-31T23:59:59.999 which is after, not before, the requested date.

> Scenario: Running a 'before' request that specifies the lowest valid system date should only generate null data
>      Given foo is before 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000
>      Then the following data should be generated:
>        | foo                     |

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the above scenario in IntelliJ (or run the Before.feature file from branch 309-before-CI)
2. See that the test fails
3. Review the error message in intelliJ

### Expected Result:
Data should be generated for before the date 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000 at the lowest possible increment (0000-12-31T23:59:59.999).

### Actual Result:
The app generates data for 0001-12-31 which is after the specified date, as seen in the error message that intelliJ returns:

> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: [null]
>      but: [1900-01-01T00:00:00.000], [0001-12-31T23:59:59.999], [null]
>  missing: 
>   counts: expected 1, but got 3

### Environment:
Run in exhaustive mode via intelliJ on branch 309-before-CI

### Additional Context:
Defect #600 is has been raised for the issue relating to the limited outputs of the system.
