## Bug Report
An "if" request is made will an "allOf" statement that contains contradictory "greaterThan" and "equalTo" statements should fail. This request did not fail as expected.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run if.feature file from cucumber tests
2. See **Scenario: Running an 'if' request that contains a contradictory allOf statement should fail with an error message ** fails
3. Look at error message generated for the failure

### Expected Result:
Where data cannot be created in an if statement due to contradictory statements then this should fast fail with a message to the user.

### Actual Result:
No error message was created and the test fails with the following error:
 
> 1 Scenarios (1 failed)
> 7 Steps (1 failed, 1 skipped, 5 passed)
> 0m0.936s
>
> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: is <true>
>     but: was <false>
