## Bug Report

If a field has one rule, and that rule sets the field's value explicitly to null, then violating that rule should not output nulls.

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Write the following profile:
```
{
  "schemaVersion": "0.1",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "X"}
  ],
  "rules": [
    {
      "constraints": [
        { "field": "X", "is": "ofType", "value": "integer" },
        { "field": "X", "is": "null" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
2. Run the above profile in violation mode

### Expected Result:
The generator should produce one violated dataset, consisting of data of any type, but no nulls.

### Actual Result:
The generator produces one dataset, consisting of data which contains a mixture of nulls and integer values.
