## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Run scenario "Running a 'matchingRegex' and 'inSet' and 'numeric' request nulls are generated last" in MatchingRegex.feature

### Expected Result:
Scenario should pass, order of results should be consistent when debugging the test or not.

### Actual Result:
Test fails sometimes when debugging or not. Most predominantly fails when not debugging.
It appears to be changing the order of which fields are fixed, and isn't consistent in its order.

Test currently ignored as part of #445
