## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:

Run the following tests, but with this step added
"And the walker type is REDUCTIVE"

MatchingRegex.feature
 - Running a 'matchingRegex' request as part of a non-contradicting anyOf constraint should be successful
 - Running a 'matchingRegex' request as part of an if constraint should be successful

### Expected Result:
The Test passes
And scenarios in If.feature when updated to run with the reductive walker run without issue

### Actual Result:
When the test tries to output the data in the InMemoryOutputTarget
it tries to collect the data, but it never finishes

### Additional Context:
If you try to look at the contents of the stream as it is collected, by making a map and breakpoint it, then the breakpoint is never hit. 
This might be because the stream of generated objects is an infinite stream of nulls
