## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Run all tests from master in intelliJ - an error report should be shown for `RegexStringGeneratorTests.shouldCorrectlyReplaceCharacterGroups`
 2. Run all tests from master via maven (mvn test) - no errors are reported

### Expected Result:
Maven should test the same things as intelliJ

### Actual Result:
`RegexStringGeneratorTests.shouldCorrectlyReplaceCharacterGroups` fails a test when run via intelliJ - it isn't run via maven.
IntelliJ detects and runs 1454 tests, of which 1 fails.
Maven detects and runs 882 tests, none fail - this includes the Cucumber tests

This was previously looked at under #421 but appears to have regressed.

We need to find our why maven isn't detecting all of our tests to make sure it doesn't happen again
