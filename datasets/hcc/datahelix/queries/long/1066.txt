## Bug Report

At present, if a field's rules constrain that field to be a string and it has no other constraints, running the generator in violation mode will output numbers and datetime objects.  However, they are output as strings, so this output does not violate the constraint.

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Write the following profile:

```
{
  "schemaVersion": "0.1",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "X" }
  ],
  "rules": [
    {
      "constraints": [
        { "field": "X", "is": "ofType", "value": "string" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Run the above profile in violation mode

### Expected Result:
No data should be output, as it is not possible to produce data that violates the above rule (and ticket #1065 implies nulls are also not valid output in this situation)

### Actual Result:
Data containing numbers and dates will be output
