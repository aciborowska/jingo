## Bug Report
Running an equal to against an invalid date (2010-13-40) or time (55:00:00.000) value in a temporal field should result in an error, but does not.

> Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' request that includes an invalid date value should fail with an error message
>      Given there is a field foo
>        And foo is equal to 2010-13-40T00:00:00.000
>      Then I am presented with an error message
>        And no data is created

> Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' request that includes an invalid time value  should fail with an error message
>      Given there is a field foo
>        And foo is equal to 2010-01-01T55:00:00.000
>      Then I am presented with an error message

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run feature file EqualTo.feature.
2. See failed Tests include *Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' request that includes an invalid date value should fail with an error message*.
3. Open error report for failing scenario to see an error is expected but no error is seen.
4. See failed Tests include *Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' request that includes an invalid time value  should fail with an error message*.
5. Open error report for failing scenario to see an error is expected but no error is seen.

### Expected Result:
When an invalid date or time is referenced within an equal to then an error should be created.

### Actual Result:
Expected error message is not seen:

> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: is <true>
>      but: was <false>
