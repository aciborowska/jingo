## Feature Request

### Description of Problem:
Violated data in the generator cannot be tested via the cucumber framework. Meaning that only one command of the generator is available for testing.

### Potential Solutions:
Update the cucumber framework to:
- [x] Allow for a switch on the generation mode: violating data vs valid data
- [x] Introduce a new step for `Given I am generating {valid|violating} data` to switch this mode
- [x] Adjust the test helper utility to use dependency injected versions of the generator 
- [x] Make the assertion steps able to read the output of the violation generator

### Acceptance criteria
* The cucumber test framework is updated to permit toggling violation testing (off by default)
* The cucumber framework is refactored so it is as close to being inline with production code as possible (use IoC - with overrides - where possible)
* One cucumber feature file including one scenario per existing feature file is created to verify the behaviour of violations.
