## Bug report

### Description of the bug
The attached profile was generated by the DataHelix Profiler using the NovelTM Metadata dataset. For some reason the Generator choked with the attached profiles (26 fields/columns).  I have a hunch that the problems were with some rows (not columns)

### Steps to reproduce:

 1. Stage the test files (one `-profile.json` file and 13 `*.csv` files) into a working directory.  (Please strip the extension `.txt`)
 2. Run the Generator with them

### Expected result:
The Generator should take the input and generate some data

### Actual result:
The follow error was returned:
```
* Profile json is not valid
empty String
```

### Additional context:
- Version of the generator: `v2.0.0` and `v2.1.3`
- Java Version: `java 13.0.1 2019-10-15`

Note: This is NOT the same bug of https://github.com/finos/datahelix/issues/1627

For this bug, I have a hunch that the problems are with some rows (not columns).  Also, the error messages were different.
