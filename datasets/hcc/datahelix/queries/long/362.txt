## Bug Report
An if request using an inset for the else statement was made in full / exhaustive mode. It was expected that all valid combinations of the inSet values should be made for the values that do not match the if statement. However these were not created.

> Scenario: Running an if request that contains a non contradictory inSet constraint within its else statement should be successful
>      Given the following fields exist:
>        | foo |
>        | bar |
>        And foo is in set:
>          | 1 |
>          | 2 |
>          | 3 |
>          | 4 |
>        And foo is anything but null
>        And bar is in set:
>          | "a" |
>          | "b" |
>          | "c" |
>        And bar is anything but null

>          "then": { "field": "bar", "is": "equalTo", "value": "b" },
>          "else": { "field": "bar", "is": "inSet", "values": [ "a", "c" ] }
>          }

>        | 1   | "b"  |
>        | 2   | "a"  |
>        | 2   | "c"  |
>        | 3   | "a"  |
>        | 3   | "c"  |
>        | 4   | "a"  |
>        | 4   | "c"  |

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the If.Feature tests (or the test above) in full / exhaustive generation mode.
2. See that the scenario **Running an if request that contains a non contradictory inSet constraint within its else statement should be successful** fails
3. Look at the associated error message to see that not all expected outputs are made.

### Expected Result:
All possible valid combinations are made, as specified in the test:
**[1, b], [2, a], [2, c], [3, a], [3, c], [4, a], [4, c]**

### Actual Result:
Test fails with an error message that shows two of the expected data entries have not been generated:
**[3, c], [4, c]**

### Environment:
Tests running on intelliJ using branch ifTestsUpdated. Run in full generation mode.

### Additional Context:
Test has been set to @ignore.
This looks like the pinning strategy is being used.
