## Bug Report
Running a test with longerThan _n_ and shorterThan _n_ where _n_ is equal tries to create a lot of data and doesn't fail. This is a problem with longerThan/shorterThan.

Assertion looking for error message fails, the tests hang as though it is actually producing a lot of data.

### Environment:
local, IntelliJ

### Additional Context:
This was tested when trying to do an invalid nested allOf so I have simplified example scenarios.

Passing Tests:
```
    Given foo is longer than 3
    And foo is shorter than 2
    Then I am presented with an error message
    And no data is created
```

Failing Tests:
```
    Given foo is longer than 2
    And foo is shorter than 2
    Then I am presented with an error message
    And no data is created
```
