## Bug Report

When running the generator from the command line, the velocity monitor prints a "Generation finished at" message at the end of generation, such as the following.

```
Generation finished at: 07:01:46
```

The timestamp is in UTC, but is not labelled as such.  This is potentially confusing to users.

The timestamp should either be explicitly labelled as UTC, or should be in the user's local time.
