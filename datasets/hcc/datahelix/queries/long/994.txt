## Bug Report

Some of the Markdown documentation files refer to the production of violating data in this way:

`java -j generator.jar generate --violate ...`

This has since changed.  The correct command is now `java -j generator.jar violate ...`

The documentation concerned must be updated.

The wiki should also be checked for this issue
