## Bug Report
When an equalTo profile is submitted to the generator running in Interesting mode only stock "canned" responses are returned. The equalTo value is ignored.

```
{
  "schemaVersion": "v3",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "first_name"
    }
  ],
  "rules": [
    {
      "field": "first_name",
      "is": "equalTo",
      "value": "callum test 01"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the profile to be the profile above (one that specifies a field that is equalTo a value)
2. Set the data generator app to run in interesting mode through the intelliJ config by adding the following to the program arguments `generate --t=INTERESTING --max-rows=200`
3. Run the data generator app through intelliJ
4. When the app has finished running open the newly created output.csv file
5. Review the contents of the file to see that the equalTo value has been omitted

### Expected Result:
In interesting mode there should be difference to how equalTo is used.
As per the profile given to the app, the field first name should be equal to "callum test 01" and null.

### Actual Result:
Only a series of canned (stock) dates, numbers and strings is returned.
```
first_name
-2147483648
0
2147483646
"Lorem Ipsum"
01-01-1900 12:00:00
01-01-2100 12:00:00


```
The equal to value of "callum test 01" has not been included.

### Environment:
Interesting mode of the app run from the master branch.

### Additional info
The same behaviour occurs with the profile uses the inSet constraint.
