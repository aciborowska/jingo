## Bug report
Setting now value to field via both  afterOrAt & beforeOrAt constraints does not work.
Related to #1706 

### Description of the bug
Giving two constraints for a date field like  afterOrAt=now and  beforeOrAt=now must give now as value but does not work.

### Steps to reproduce:
Using the profile
```
{
	"fields": [
		{
			"name": "today",
			 "type": "date",
			 "nullable": false
		}
	],
	"constraints": [
		{
			"field": "today",
			"afterOrAt": "now"
		},
		{
			"field": "today",
			"beforeOrAt": "now"
		}		
	]
}
```
Run datahelix in random mode. Here are the command line arguments I used to run the profile:
```
generate
--max-rows=100
--replace
--profile-file=D:\path\to\helix\profile.json
--output-path=D:\path\to\helix\out.csv
--output-format=csv
--generation-type=RANDOM
--set-from-file-directory=D:\path\to\helix
```

### Expected result:
Records with value current date.

### Actual result:
The provided profile is wholly contradictory!

### Additional context:
After trying equalTo=now  #1706, I tried this solution with no luck.
