When running the below cucumber feature file:

Scenario:
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to 2018-01-03T00:00:00.000
    And foo is not null
    And foo is of type "temporal"
    And foo is formatted as "%tF"

We would expect 2018-01-03 to be generated.
Instead with equalTo being used, the DG will only read the field entered as a string and provides a different result.
