## Bug Report
An if request was written that contains an ofLength constraint. Although data is generated for values that matches the statement (the then statement) no data is generated for values for the else statement.

> Scenario: Running an if request that contains a non contradictory ofLength constraint within its if statement should be successful
>      Given the following fields exist:
>        | foo |
>        | bar |
>        And foo is in set:
>          | 1    |
>          | 2    |
>          | "a1" |
>          | "b2" |
>        And bar is in set:
>          | 10   |
>          | 20   |
>          | "AA" |
>          | "BB" |
>        And there is a constraint:
>        """
>          {
>          "if": { "field": "foo", "is": "ofLength", "value": 2 },
>          "then": { "field": "bar", "is": "equalTo", "value": "AA" },
>          "else": { "field": "bar", "is": "equalTo", "value": 10 }
>          }
>        """
>      Then the following data should be generated:
>        | foo  | bar  |
>        | 1    | 10   |
>        | 2    | 10   |
>        | "a1" | "AA" |
>        | "b2" | "AA" |

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run feature file if.feature
2. See that scenario **Running an if request that contains a non contradictory ofLength constraint within its if statement should be successful** fails
3. Look at the error to see that one of the expected combinations [1, 10], [2, 10] are missing from the output.

### Expected Result:
Data should have been created for combinations of values that match the ofLegnth and do not match the ofLegnth in the if statement (as per the then and else logic).

### Actual Result:
The else part of the statement is ignored and no gata is generated for is, as seen in the error message:

> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: [1, 10], [2, 10], [a1, AA], [b2, AA]
>      but: [a1, AA], [b2, AA]
>  missing: [1, 10], [2, 10]
>   counts: expected 4, but got 2
