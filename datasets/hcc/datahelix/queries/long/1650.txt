## Bug report

### Description of the bug
ND-JSON data should be emitted as a single line of data (in JSON format) with a final new-line (\n) character to indicate the end of the record.

This isn't the case, each record is being pretty-printed, as such new line characters are included in the content of the JSON representation.

### Steps to reproduce:
 1. Run the generator with the `--output-format=JSON` switch

### Expected result:
Each record is encapsulated in a single line, finishing with the `\n` character.
