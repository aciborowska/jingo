## Bug Report

### Steps to reproduce
- Run the generator in violation mode with the output path set as `"c:\temp\"`

### Expected result
The generator should be able to create violation output files in c:\temp

### Actual result
The generator throws an error, because `"` isn't a supported character.

### Additional context
The generator should treat the path as `c:\temp\` (or strip off the trailing `\`, leaving `c:\temp`).
It looks like PicoCli is treating the `\` as an escape character for `"` and leaving this in the string, therefore the trailing `\` is never seen.

The behaviour can be seen in non-violating and visualising modes too, but these modes require a file path, which itself can never end with a `\`.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Update documentation to reflect behaviour
- [x] Update expected outputs mindmaps
