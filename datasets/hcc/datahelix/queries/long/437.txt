## Bug Report

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Running in Full generation mode, string contradictions, should still yield null.
2. Example Cucumber test:
```
Background:
     Given the generation strategy is full
      And there is a field foo
      And foo is of type "string"

Scenario: Running a 'matchingRegex' request alongside a contradicting ofLength (too short) constraint should generate null only
     Given foo is matching regex /[b]{2}/
       And foo is of length 1
     Then the following data should be generated:
        | foo  |
        | null |
```
### Expected Result:
null is generated

### Actual Result:
Nothing is generated.
