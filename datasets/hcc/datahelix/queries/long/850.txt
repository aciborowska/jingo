## Bug Report
Granularity of generated data still seems to be affected by range - generated decimal data may be formatted to 20.d.p. but some/all of the decimal places are just added 0s. Single/no bound results in decimal formatted integers, large ranges result in varying degrees of granularity.

### Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Create field foo
 2. Set type decimal, not null
 3. Generate data in random mode

### Expected Result:
Random decimals with up to twenty decimal places

### Actual Result:
Random integers formatted with twenty (0) decimal places

### Additional Context:
Should have been fixed by #655 / #704 

### Example Profile:
```json
{
    "schemaVersion": "0.1",
    "description": "Testing Profile",
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "foo"
        }
    ],
    "rules": [
        {
            "rule": "rule1",
            "constraints": [
                {
                    "field": "foo",
                    "is": "ofType",
                    "value": "decimal"
                },
                {
                    "not": {
                        "field": "foo",
                        "is": "null"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
