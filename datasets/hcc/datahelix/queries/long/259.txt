## Bug Report
A test containing an invalid numeric value (positively signed) within an array does not throw an error as expected.

> Scenario: Running an exhaustive combination strategy with invalid number values should fail with an appropriate error message
>      Given the following fields exist:
>        | foo |
>        | bar |
>        And foo is of type "numeric"
>        And bar is of type "numeric"
>        And foo is in set:
>          | 999 |
>          **| +12 |**
>        And bar is in set:
>          | 12.01 |
>          | 0     |
>      Then I am presented with an error message
>        And no data is created

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run tests from the feature file ExhaustiveCombination.feature
2. See that there is a failure for the test **Running an exhaustive combination strategy with invalid number values should fail with an appropriate error message**
3. Note that the error message asserts that no failure is generated.

### Expected Result:
Adding an invalid numeric value of | +12 | for a field specified as numeric should result in an error.

### Actual Result:
The expected error was not generated, resulting in the test failing with an error message:

> java.lang.AssertionError: 
> Expected: is `true`
>      but: was `false`
> 	at org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(MatcherAssert.java:20)
> 	at org.junit.Assert.assertThat(Assert.java:956)
> 	at org.junit.Assert.assertThat(Assert.java:923)
> 	at com.scottlogic.deg.generator.cucumber.steps.GeneralTestStep.dataGeneratorShouldError(GeneralTestStep.java:88)
> 	at âœ½.I am presented with an error message(C:/DataGenerator/data-engineering-generator/generator/src/test/java/com/scottlogic/deg/generator/cucumber/ExhaustiveCombination.feature:133)

### Environment:
ExhaustiveCombination branch running in full generation strategy & exhaustive combination strategy on IntelliJ.
