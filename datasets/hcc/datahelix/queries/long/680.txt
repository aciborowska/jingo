### Description
We have noticed that a few of the tests inside the GreaterThan.feature are spuriously producing numbers like 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028, 1029 when we expect 2,3,4,5,6

Initially this was one test but we have observed the same issue in several other scenarios in this feature:
* Running a 'greaterThan' request that specifies an integer should be successful
* greaterThan run against a non contradicting not lessThan should be successful (greaterThan 1 AND not lessThan 2)
* greaterThan run against a non contradicting not lessThanOrEqualTo should be successful

**These tests have been ignored until we can be certain of their validity.**

Example scenario:

```gherkin
Scenario: Running a 'greaterThan' request that specifies an integer should be successful
     Given foo is greater than 1
	   And foo is anything but null
       And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
     Then the following data should be generated:
       | foo |
       | 2   |
       | 3   |
       | 4   |
       | 5   |
       | 6   |
```

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] All 3 scenarios un-ignored and runs consistently over 10 or more runs (with and without the debugger attached)
- [ ] Exhaustive combination strategy updated to use non-parallel streams, for consistency
- [ ] Performance reviewed to ensure performance isn't noticeably affected for the suite as a whole (+/- 5% tolerance)
- [ ] All other tests pass without any other change
