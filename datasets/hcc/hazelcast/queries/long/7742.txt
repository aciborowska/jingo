**Test:** 
- Create 3 node Hazelcast cluster with topic listeners on each node listening on a topic
- Stop one instance (use kill -SIGSTOP <PID>) and get the member left notification on other two nodes
- Continue the stopped process (use kill -SIGCONT <pid>) and the node will get merged in to the main cluster
- Send a topic message to nodes.

**Observation:**
- MERGED node/nodes won't receive any topic messages sent. 

**ISSUE:**
- Topic listeners on MERGED nodes get removed after the merge event of a split brain scenario.
