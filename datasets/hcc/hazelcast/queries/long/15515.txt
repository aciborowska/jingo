Calling IMap.removeAll without index updates last access time for all records. As a result expiration time is also updated when maxIdle eviction is used. If removeAll is called frequently then records are never removed by maxIdle.
Hazelcast version: 3.12.2
Attached unit test demonstrating this behaviour.
