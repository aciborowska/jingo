I'm using Hazelcast 3.7.4, and I have both lite and non-lite members.  

On my lite members I'm setting near-cache as follows:
```
NearCacheConfig nearCacheConfig = new NearCacheConfig(0, cacheSize, EvictionPolicy.LRU.name(), 0, true, InMemoryFormat.OBJECT);
config.getMapConfig(mapName).setNearCacheConfig(nearCacheConfig);
```
I have configured entry listener on my lite member and could verify that it is called on change. Moreover, the old and new value content is correct.

But when I'm trying to get the value from the map I'm still getting the old value. 

While debugging, I've tried to look at the map content and I could see the new value, but when I'm calling ``map.get(key)`` the old value is returned.
