```
Chapter 5.16.1 of the Mastering Hazelcast book claims that a MultiMap can be configured to use the binary property so that you can store your values in object format.
However, when i try to use it, it is not recognised as a valid property:

<hz:multimap name="test" binary="false"></hz:multimap>

Any ideas why this is happening? I am using Spring 4.2.0 and Hazelcast 3.6
```

I just checked the hazelcast-spring-3.6.xsd and the binary property is missing. All other Multimap properties should be checked as well in case others are missing.
