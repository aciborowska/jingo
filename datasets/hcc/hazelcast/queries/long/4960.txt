Currently, when a client gets a cache that is not created yet, it gets its config from the node that owner of cache. After gets the config, it sends a request (`CacheCreateConfigRequest`) to this node create cache config also on other nodes. But at current code, since that cache config is already created at that node (since its config has already been taken from it via `CacheGetConfigRequest`), it doesn't create also on other nodes as seen here https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/cache/impl/operation/CacheCreateConfigOperation.java#L89
