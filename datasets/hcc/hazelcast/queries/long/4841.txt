On Dynamic Cluster, new member can take and execute a cache operation before it gets cache config via cache replication operation. In this case, there will be error about unknown cache/cache config. After a cache replication event is received, these configs will be taken but at this time it does'n execute some cache operations (such as cache put backup) due to unknown cache config. And this may cause data lost.
