The `clearStorage()` method of `DefaultRecordStore` calls `onClear()` on mutation observer after the storage itself is being cleared. For index mutation observer it doesn't work because clearing of the index entries relies on the information from the storage which is already cleared. 

As a result, the global indices may contain dangling pointers. For on-heap indices it will lead to the inconsistent indices while for HD ones it may eventually cause JVM crash. 

However, we have to confirm that changing the order wouldn't violate any logic for other mutation observers. @mmedenjak , @mdogan , @ahmetmircik , guys, WDYT?

The fix needs a backport to 4.0 and 3.x.
