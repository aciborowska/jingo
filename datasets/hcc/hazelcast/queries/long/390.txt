If you use the constructor which provides an XML file, it creates a new FileInputStream.  There is no ability to close this input stream after it is created.  I am aware that FileInputStream will close in the finalizer, but still feel this is an issue that warranted to be filed, just in case someone is preventing the XmlConfigBuilder from being GC'ed (not sure why you would, but you should be able to).
