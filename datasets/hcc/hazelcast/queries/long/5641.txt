Hi,

I am using hazelcast 3.4.1 and I implement custom LoggerFactory. While starting application it creates custom LoggerFactory two times if you are using XmlConfigBuilder for example. XmlConfigBuilder has LoggerFactory.getLogger(...) which creates custom LoggerFactory first time as it doesn't exist yet. Second time it is created when Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance -> Node.init -> LoggingServiceImpl.init is called as it need to instantiate for application and it doesn't know that it exists already. 

I think it would be better to prepare some singleton solution in LoggerFactory interface and stop using public constructor. Attaching stack traces of creating those two instances.
