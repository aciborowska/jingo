The Comparable that's passed to a `Predicate` has to be thread-safe.

`java.util.Date` is a Java in-built class that implements the `Comparable` interface which is NOT thread safe. 

The `Predicate` is sent to local and remote partitions. If there's more than one partition on each node (very likely) a Predicate instance will be re-used. It may lead to the corruption of the `Date` instance.

**Main concern:**
We should create a wrapper of a `Date` to make it immutable and thread-safe whenever used in a Predicate.

**Side concerns:**
Currently the comparison of java.util.Date, java.sql.Timestamp, java.sql.Time and java.sql.Time is not transitive between each combination of two of them. We should look into that too to make the comparison of such types better without conversion.
