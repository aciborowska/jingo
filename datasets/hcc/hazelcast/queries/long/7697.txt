Hi All,

I currently have a setup where there are 2 nodes are clustered using hazelcast. Each node has their member attributes added through code. Example : 

`hazelcastInstance.getCluster().getLocalMember().setStringAttribute("foo", "bar");`

When a network disconnection occur, each node will get notified that the other member has left the cluster. This creates a split brain scenario. After a while, once the network is back online, each node will recognize each other and I see the MERGED log as well on a node.

`INFO {com.hazelcast.core.LifecycleService} -  [10.100.5.197]:4001 [wso2.carbon.domain] [3.5.2] Address[10.100.5.197]:4001 is MERGED`

The above log could appear on either of the node(disregarding the IP).

But some of the member attributes that was assigned to members of the cluster has been assigned null. Is this the expected behaviour ?

Is there an event which we can reassigned the member attributes after the merging occur ? . I tried using  a `LifecycleListener` to reassigned the member attributes when the `LifecycleState.MERGED` event happens. But still the member attributes are null. Is there an event afterwards ?

Regards,
