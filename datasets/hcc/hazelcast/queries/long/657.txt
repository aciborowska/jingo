If a system is overloaded with work, tasks like adding a new member to the cluster can  be starved from being executed since it wil lift on the same system as normal operations.

This can lead to new members not being able to join the cluster; something you really want to be able to do because if a system is under pressure, you want to be able to scale up.

So everything related the system management like members related operations, should be moved to its own subsystem which should not be influenced (too much) by an overload in the rest of the system. Of course.. 100% isolation isn't possible since threads, memory, network etc is being shared.
