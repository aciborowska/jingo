Hazelcast 3.12.2

For example. This code works fine:
`cacheClient.getCollectionFilterByPredicate(clazz, Predicates.ilike("firstName", "alexey"))`
firstName is a String field with value 'Alexey'

`cacheClient.getCollectionFilterByPredicate(clazz, Predicates.ilike("firstName", "алексей"))`
firstName is a String field with value 'Алексей'

Could you fix this? Our business logic relates on this kind of filters.
