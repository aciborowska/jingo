`ManagementCenterService` shuts down itself if it encounters an exception when creating the `TimedMemberState`. This issue makes the cluster to disappear from MC. The related code is here: https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/91ae6c327b9c2e8f73e95a1ffadfeba090267272/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/internal/management/ManagementCenterService.java#L447-L460

This happens even if the exception is a retryable one such as in this case:
```
[127.0.0.1]:5702 [A] [4.0-SNAPSHOT] Hazelcast Management Center Service will be shutdown due to exception.
com.hazelcast.spi.exception.RetryableHazelcastException: HazelcastInstance[[127.0.0.1]:5702] is not active!
