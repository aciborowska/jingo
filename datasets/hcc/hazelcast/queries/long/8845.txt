In Hazelcast 3.7, a read-through call to `MapLoader.load(K k)` puts the object loaded into the primary partition but not any backup partitions.

This does not impact on data safety. If the primary partition is lost, a read for that key from the backup will trigger the `load(K k)` call, so that partition is re-populated from the external store.

However, ManCenter will show different counts for entries and backups, which although correct, is confusing.
