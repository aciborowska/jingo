When a List is used for Reducer ValueIn, ReducerTask slits the List and calls reducer.reduce method for every element but since reducer expects a List and element can't be cast to List. At run-time Hazelcast gives java.lang.ClassCastException exception on com.hazelcast.mapreduce.impl.task.ReducerTask.reduceChunk(ReducerTask.java:118)

Exception in thread "main" java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.ClassCastException: ClassName cannot be cast to java.util.List
