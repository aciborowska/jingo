Cluster of 2 nodes.  We shut them both down from ManCenter (3.6-EA3-SNAPSHOT).  We then attempt to restart both nodes.  Frequently, one of the nodes on restart will immediately shutdown (without error).  Restarting it again for a second time and everything is fine.

To be clear: On the first restart, both nodes come up, form a cluster (we see this cluster formation on both nodes), and then one node shuts itself down (or is told to shutdown).
