openGetTaskConnection method's connection hasn't any timeout settings.

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/3.12.z/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/internal/management/ManagementCenterService.java#L732

The following settings should be added.

```
connection.setConnectTimeout(CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MILLIS);
connection.setReadTimeout(CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MILLIS);
```

Thanks.
