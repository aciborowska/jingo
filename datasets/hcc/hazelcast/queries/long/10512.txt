The issue I am facing is that :
- Predicate queries are run from multiple clients(IMap are indexed on  a single field and queries are run on the same field)
- After a few mins, memory is filled up in Old Gen  and triggers an old gc
- After the old gc runs, most of the old gen space is freed-up.(Java Flight Record shows most of garbage collected objects as weak-references)
My question is: Are the cache serialised values getting tenured to old gen? If yes, then, is there an option in hazelcast to set a time-to-live for these objects?
