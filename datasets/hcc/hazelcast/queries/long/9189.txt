I am using the official Docker image for hazelcast (tried both versions 3.7.1 and 3.7.2)
I have registered a lifecycle listener through the xml configuration file.
However I cannot see it receiving the _STARTING_ lifecycle event, or the _SHUTTING_DOWN_ and _SHUTDOWN_ events, only the _STARTED_ event.

After going through the source code, I have traced it to [firing lifecycle STARTING event](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/instance/HazelcastInstanceImpl.java#L132) before [lifecycle listeners are added from the configuration](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/instance/HazelcastInstanceImpl.java#L134)

With regards to the _SHUTTING_DOWN_ and _SHUTDOWN_ events, I am not quite sure why this happens, I request a docker container instance to stop using `docker stop _INSTANCE_`, but neither event is received from the listener.
