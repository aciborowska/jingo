In [AbstractInternalQueryCache](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/map/impl/querycache/subscriber/AbstractInternalQueryCache.java) the private method `getQueryCacheConfig()` is called in multiple places.

This in turn calls
[NodeQueryCacheConfigurator](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/map/impl/querycache/subscriber/NodeQueryCacheConfigurator.java) public method `getOrCreateConfiguration(mapName,cacheName,cacheId)`

And this calls [AbstractQueryCacheConfigurator](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/map/impl/querycache/subscriber/AbstractQueryCacheConfigurator.java) the method `setEntryListener(MapName,cacheId,config)` adds the listener.

The net effect being the listener is added more than once, event handling is duplicated.

Tested on 3.10.2, on server side, but looks like the same issue client side.
