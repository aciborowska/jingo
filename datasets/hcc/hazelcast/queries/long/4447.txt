When using the following dependencies

<!-- JCache API-->

```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>javax.cache</groupId>
        <artifactId>cache-api</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- JCache Provider -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
        <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
        <version>3.3.3</version>
    </dependency>
```

Different Named caches have being put the same key and different values. 

At the end only the last put key value pair is existing in the cache. The key value pairs of the same name in other named caches disappears. As a solution i have prepended the cache name to the key and it works but this defeats the whole purpose of having named caches.
