Altova XML Spy complains about an invalid regular expression in https://hazelcast.com/schema/spring/hazelcast-spring-3.5.xsd (actually in versions 3.3 and 3.4 too). This is about the following line:

```
<xs:simpleType name="parameterizedValueType">
    <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
        <xs:pattern value="(\$|\#)\{([^=^:]+)\}"/>
    </xs:restriction>
</xs:simpleType>
```

The reason is that $ is not a meta-character in XML regular expressions, and thus quoting it with backslash is dubious. I suggest changing that regex to 
`[$#]\{([^=^:]+)\}`
which means the same thing.

By the way: `[^=^:]` looks a little strange, too. I'm not quite sure what that the intuition is behind this - should that regex really mean "everything except equals, colon and caret"?
