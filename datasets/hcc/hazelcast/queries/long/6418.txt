Map configuration as follows:

```
           <map name="Cache1">
                                            <in-memory-format>BINARY</in-memory-format>      
                                            <backup-count>0</backup-count>        
                                            <async-backup-count>0</async-backup-count>              
                                            <max-size policy="PER_NODE">400</max-size>
                                            <eviction-policy>LFU</eviction-policy>
                                            <eviction-percentage>10</eviction-percentage>              
                                            <merge-policy> com.hazelcast.map.merge.HigherHitsMapMergePolicy</merge-policy>             
            </map>           
```

The map was populated with 380 entries. We could see that,  eviction happens even if 380 entries are added. The following are the values of important counters.

localPutOperationCount = 380
totalEvictedEntryCount = 2
size = 378

After this step I added 10 more entries in the cache. After this counter value looks as follows

localPutOperationCount=390
totalEvictedEntryCount=11
size=379

Another 10 more entries are added. After this counter value looks as follows

localPutOperationCount=400
totalEvictedEntryCount=21
size=379

Eviction should not have triggered before 400 entries in the cluster but it gets fired even at 380 entries. This is consistently reproducible, just use the above configurations and try putting entries as mentioned above.
