The Hazelcast docs show a default config for WAN replication that includes the following config item:
`<replication-impl>com.hazelcast.impl.wan.WanNoDelayReplication</replication-impl>`

This item appears to be configuring what WAN replication implementation to use.

Surprisingly this config item is not being used at all. Instead the replication implementation is hard coded in WanReplicationService.java line 48:

```
WanReplicationEndpoint target = new WanNoDelayReplication();
```

Either replication-impl should be removed from the config and docs or it should be used by Hazelcast.
