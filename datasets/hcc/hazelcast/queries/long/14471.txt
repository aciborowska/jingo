When `IMap.delete` is called from the client, the map statistics are not updated as they do with `IMap.remove` call. See the following test which fails:

```
@Test
public void testStatsAfterDeleteFromClient(){
    String name = "testMap";
    IMap<Object, Object> map = client.getMap(name);

    map.delete(1);

    assertEquals(1, hazelcastInstance.getMap(name)
            .getLocalMapStats().getRemoveOperationCount());
}
```
