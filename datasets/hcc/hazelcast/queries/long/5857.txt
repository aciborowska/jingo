ClientMapProxy and MapProxyImpl differ slightly in behaviour for the following methods:
- executeOnKey
- submitToKey (2 overloads)

In MapProxyImpl, these create an EntryOperation with the threadId set. This does not happen with ClientMapProxy. MapExecuteOnKeyRequest should hence take a threadId and set this on the generated EntryOperation.

This matters when a process explicitly locks a key in a distributed map, and then proceeds to invoke executeOnKey or submitToKey. This will work without issue for full members for the reasons described above, but may not work for clients.
