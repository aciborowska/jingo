
hot restart test, 
http://jenkins.hazelcast.com/view/hot-restart/job/hot-bounce/50/console

where i kill -9 all cluster members, and restart. 
after a few rounds of this, it fails with

fail HzMember3HZ java.lang.IllegalStateException: Node failed to start!

maybe, some times the cluster is not killed quick enough so the partition table changes just before all cluster members are killed, which leads to Node failed to start.
