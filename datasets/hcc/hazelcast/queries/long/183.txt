It looks like I am receiving duplicate entry update events in the native client. In fact, the number of duplicates received is dependent on the number of times I have called map.addEntryListener( listener, key, bSendValue ).

So if the client registers three times, each time for a different key (say: 'A', 'B', and 'C'), then the 'B' entry is updated by a member, the client receives the update 'B' event three times. If four different events had been registered, the client would receive four update events.

I have verified the same behavior in 2.0.4 and 2.1.2.
I do not see this behavior if the listeners are on a cluster member.

To reproduce:

Create a single node with a map and have it continually update entries.
Create a native client that attaches to the node and makes three addEntryListener() calls on the map, each to a specific key.
Notice the client will get three update events for each single update.

I have only verified that this is a problem with the EntryListener.entryUpdated. It most likely applies to all events.
