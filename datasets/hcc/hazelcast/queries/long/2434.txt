When activating deferred-result, HazelcastHttpSession.getAttribute places an entry with the given key and value NULL_ENTRY.
When HazelcastHttpSession.getAttributeNames is later called, it returns these entries although setAttribute was never called.
Looking at the code, a possible fix will be to modify HazelcastHttpSession.selectKeys() (WebFilter.java line 628)

``` java
if (!entry.getValue().removed)
```

to

``` java
if (!entry.getValue().removed && entry != NULL_ENTRY)
```

Thanks
