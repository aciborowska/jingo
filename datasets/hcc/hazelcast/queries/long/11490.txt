Issue caused by race between PostJoinOperations and the node doing the listener registration. 
A node needs to send invocations to all cluster. If a new member joins the cluster, we expect that listener registrations will go with post join operation. But since there is race between these two, we are ending up a new node without listener registration. 

Issue found in a client test.
