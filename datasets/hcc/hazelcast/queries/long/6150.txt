The behavior for List/Set/Queue and local transactions is not well defined. They rely on the existence of at minimal an empty backup log, but with a local transaction there is no backup tx log.

AFAIK it can happen that when the coordinator of a transaction goes down an there are uncommitted changes made in the primaries and backups, that these uncommitted change are not being cleared. So the system can eventually run into an OOME.
