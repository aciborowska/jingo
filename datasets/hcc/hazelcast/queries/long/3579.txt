We've been testing 3.3-RC3 since it came out and two days ago we upgraded to v3.3. Since then we've seen a dramatic performance regression which we were able to trace back to IMap maxSize semantics changing from `0 == UNLIMITED` to `0 == 0`. This is causing our caches to constantly evict their data rendering them useless.

We could not find any reference to it in the [release notes](http://hazelcast.org/docs/3.3/manual/html/whats-new-33.html), which surprised us because this is a big semantic change.
