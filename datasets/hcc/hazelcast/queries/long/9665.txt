
while making async operations test,  I got a client side GC Overhead limit exceeded,  OOME http://54.87.52.100/~jenkins/workspace/temp/HzClient460HZ-hprof.zip

One instance of "com.hazelcast.util.executor.LoggingScheduledExecutor" loaded by "sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader @ 0xe6fae438" occupies 327,143,344 (97.65%) bytes. The memory is accumulated in one instance of "java.util.concurrent.RunnableScheduledFuture[]" loaded by "<system class loader>".`

so it looks like in hat master,  we have a client side OOME,

member side seams ok.

i can only get this result with a full on 2000 client 3 member,
