Hello,

We are having a problem with the sources of the Hazelcast 3.8.4 release.
It seems the source code doesn't match the classes in the jar for the same version.

We downloaded both the jar and the sources from the mavel central repository:
http://central.maven.org/maven2/com/hazelcast/hazelcast/3.8.4/hazelcast-3.8.4.jar
http://central.maven.org/maven2/com/hazelcast/hazelcast/3.8.4/hazelcast-3.8.4-sources.jar

An example of such mismatch is the package: com/hazelcast/cache/impl/maxsize/impl.
In the jar there is only EntryCountCacheMaxSizeChecker class but in the sources there is also EntryCountCacheEvictionChecker class.

It seems the issue comes from the shaded hazelcast-client-protocol that contains the Hazelcast sources from a different version.

Would it be possible to check this?

Thank you,
Ruxandra
