During some Simulator runs I noticed a partition imbalance with the  `PartitionGroupConfiguration` we use:

```
    <partition-group enabled="true" group-type="HOST_AWARE">
    </partition-group>
```

I made a cleanup of the `PartitionDistributionTest` and added new test cases with that configuration which fail (#5354). Just clusters with an odd member count seem to fail.

Here is the output of the new tests:
