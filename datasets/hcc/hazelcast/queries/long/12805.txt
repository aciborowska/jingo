When merging the values from the smaller cluster, not all data structures set the statistics from the received `MergingValue`.

A fix for this may collide with the change to allow completely new user data, which doesn't contain statistical values. In this case we cannot decide which statistics should be applied. A possible solution is to set the merging statistics just, when the new values are equal to the merging values. Otherwise keep the statistics from the existing values.

An example for this is the `MultiMap`.
