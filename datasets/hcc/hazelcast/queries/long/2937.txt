I am seeing some weird cluster behaviour in hazelcast 3.2.1 which I want to understand better.

I have a cluster of two nodes, "A" and "B", this is what I see in the logs (can't copy those here for varios reasons)
- "A" is up and running, "B" gets restarted.
- When "B" is back, "A" joins and they form a cluster. "B" becomes master.
- A MergeOperation is started on "A" for an IMap, as it has a maploader associated and the freshly started "B" also has the data primed
- "B" shuts down suddenly
- "A" discovers that "B" is gone and logs that it removes "B" from the cluster and "A" becomes master
- "A" tries connecting to "B" periodically, to see if it's back, but connections are refused by "B" (as its down)
- The MergeOperation started at point (3) keeps writing its logs forever, occupying its thread. It's never cancelled.
- The map on which the merge started will never be usable on node "A" as all operations are getting that infamous "Map is not ready!!!" messages
