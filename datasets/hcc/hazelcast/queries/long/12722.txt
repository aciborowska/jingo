The merge policy checks in `ConfigValidator` are based on false assumptions regarding `SomeConfig.isStatisticsEnabled()` and valid split-brain merge types. The `MergingHits` capability doesn't depend on enabled statistics, just on the data structure. There are just two merge types for `IMap`, which depend on the statistics configuration (`MergingLastStoredTime` and `MergingExpirationTime`).

The current implementation also doesn't work for custom merge policies, since it only checks our out-of-the-box merge policies.

We should rely on the required and provided merge types of https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12721 to implement a proper solution for the config validation.
