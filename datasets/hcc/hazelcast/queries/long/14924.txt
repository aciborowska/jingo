When HZ configuration is set by `hazelcast.config` and given file does not have extension "xml", "yaml" or "yml" then locator of configuration file silently ignore `hazelcast.config` and continue in lookup to another step `A file named hazelcast.xml located in the application's working directory`. 

It can be confusing for users since configuration file in `hazelcast.config` is set deliberately but Hazelcast can be started with different configuration without throwing any exception.

In HZ version older than `3.12` every file passed to Hazelcast by `hazelcast.config` was considered as xml file and tried to be parsed. It means that valid xml file with name `hazelcast-config.whatever` passed by `hazelcast.config` property was correctly used as HZ configuration file. It is regression in `3.12` since in current implementation file `hazelcast-config.whatever` is silently ignored and different file is used as Hazelcast configuration.
