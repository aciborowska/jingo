HazelCastClients connecting to the server cause a memory leak on the server.
Steps to reproduce:
Create and run basic server: Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(cfg);

Create basic client in a loop (1000 iterations) and connect/disconnect.
HazelcastClient  hzc=HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(cfg);
System.out.println(hzc.getCluster());
hzc.shutdown();

Monitor server JVM with Java VisualVM. Heap usage grows relatively fast.
It seems that failed logins (bad pwd) cause a bigger leak but successful logins leak as well. You can create a HazelCast server OOM Exception just by connecting and disconnecting without ever storing any data on it!
