**Describe the bug**
Tested on 3.12.2 which is customer's version.
In a cluster with Quorum defined, without touching any maps, just calling `Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();` causes `QuorumListener` to be triggered, before the member joins anyone and forms the cluster initially. 

**Expected behavior**
We shouldnâ€™t fire any quorum listener events after a member starts until quorum is met initially.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Define a quorum of 3 with a listener attached 
```
    <quorum enabled="true" name="myquorum">
        <quorum-size>3</quorum-size>
        <quorum-listeners>
            <quorum-listener>MyQuoLis</quorum-listener>
        </quorum-listeners>
    </quorum>
```
2. Start one member
3. Observe how member logs a quorum event before join:
