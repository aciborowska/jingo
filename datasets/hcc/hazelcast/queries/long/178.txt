What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Run Hazelcast (2.1.1) with one persistent Queue (queue with backed-map with MapStore). Configure ttl for backed-map = 1 sec
2. Create a multithreaded client that will offer messages to this queue (100 threads with while(true) { queue.offer(message) }, for example)
3. In your MapStore implementation add AtomicLong as a counter for storeAll/store. 
4. Add some random delays in storeAll/store to simulate DB connection (10-15 msec will be enough).
5. Add output of stored entities to storeAll/store - for example "logger.info(String.format("%d: %s stored", counter.get(), entry)
6. Start client with 2000000-4000000 messages-to-put count

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect that i'll get  2000000-4000000 as MapStore's counter value, also i expect that all messages that has been offered will appears in MapStore's logs.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
2.1.1, Windows Server 2008R2, 4-cores machine
