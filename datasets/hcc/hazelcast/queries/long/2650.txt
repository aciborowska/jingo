When calling the ExecutorService with MemberSelector instance, and no proper instances can be found, then exception is thrown:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: n must be positive
    at java.util.Random.nextInt(Unknown Source)
    at com.hazelcast.executor.ExecutorServiceProxy.submit(ExecutorServiceProxy.java:105)

In the ExecutorServiceProxy class java.util.Random is used, but when it's called with 0, the above exception is thrown.
Reproducible on version 3.3-EA and 3.2.2
