```
class AuthenticationFuture {

    Connection get(int timeout) throws Throwable {
        if (!countDownLatch.await(timeout, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
            throw new TimeoutException("Authentication response did not come back in " + timeout + " millis");
        }
        if (connection != null) {
            return connection;
        }
        assert throwable != null;
        throw throwable;<----
    }
}
```

You can't rethrow an exception from a different thread; it will lead to exceptions with very obscure stacktraces.
