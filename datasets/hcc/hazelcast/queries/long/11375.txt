if i use [execute](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/maintenance-3.x/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/spi/impl/operationservice/impl/OperationServiceImpl.java#L283) to call an operation and if it times out, [here](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/maintenance-3.x/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/spi/impl/operationservice/impl/OperationRunnerImpl.java#L258) operation cannot send response because `responseHandler` is null (assuming caller didn't set it initially). And it leads NPE.
