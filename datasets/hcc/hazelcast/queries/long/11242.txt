The following program runs fine even though no valid address has been added.

```
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args){
        HazelcastInstance server = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();

        ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
        clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().addAddress("");

        HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);
        System.out.println(client.getAtomicLong("foo").incrementAndGet());
    }
}
```

So we violate fail-fast.

We should check if the passed address is a valid ip address or hostname.
