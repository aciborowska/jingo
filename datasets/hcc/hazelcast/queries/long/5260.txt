When using XA Transactions in Hazelcast 3.4;
Do some transactional operation, sleep until timeout (or possibly changing timeout value to a small value) and then call commit on `XAResource` and let it timeout. 
Eventually Hazelcast is throwing a `TransactionException` instead of an `XAException` with code `XAException.XA_RBTIMEOUT`.
