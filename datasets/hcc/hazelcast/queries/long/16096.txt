We are keeping some data in hazelcast grid. For that we are using IMap. 
Total records 48K (approx). Total size for 48K records is not more than 600MB.
After every 5 - 15 mins, we need to refresh this Map. For that we are using loadAll(true). 
We see that there is a continue increase of heap memory usage. 
We profiled the GC (garbage colelctor) using different parameters but no help.
Then we used IMap.clear and IMap.loadAll(false). After this, the heap memory usage is near about consistent.
So, it seems that there is a memory leak when using IMap.loadAll(true).
Or we might be missing some hazelcast configuration. 
We are using hazelcast version 3.10.4. We also tested same scenario on 3.12.4. Facing same issue.
Can you please suggest us what wrong we are doing?
