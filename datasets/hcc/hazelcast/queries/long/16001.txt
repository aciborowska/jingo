Gathering the `MultiMap` statistics for the diagnostics (3.x) and for the metrics system (4.x) is taken as access, which breaks the `LastAccessMergePolicy` split-brain healing policy and may lead to merging the wrong side to the right side. 

**Analysis**
Merging `MultiMap`s is done on container-basis rather than on entry-basis. Therefore, `MultiMapContainer` has the `lastAccessTime` field that the `LastAccessMergePolicy` relies on. This `lastAccessTime` gets updated every time the `MultiMapContainer` is accessed. `MultiMapService#getStats()` also updates `lastAccessTime` hence breaks `LastAccessMergePolicy` because stats collection should not be counted as an access. 

**Other accesses**
There is `MultiMapService#getOrCreateCollectionContainerWithoutAccess` to avoid the aforementioned problem in some other cases like during migration or from backup operations. The fix for this issue should be introducing a method that gets the `MultiMapContainer` without accessing or creating it.
