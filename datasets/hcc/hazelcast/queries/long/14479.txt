`lock.lock();`

shows that 'lock.lock();'  has hanged on both sides of the split brain


2nd ocurance of cp lock hanging in a split brain test, http://jenkins.hazelcast.com/view/cp-system/job/cp-lock-split/7/console
it looks like a hanging fail is not so common fail mode.


in the split brain test the network is partitioned and healed, so at the end of the test the network is restored and the cluster is in a safe state, and some times the tests hangs at lock();
