To determine the memory size of an IMap is done by iterating over all map entries and therefor has complexity of O(N) with N being the number of entries. This should be reduced to O(1) by updating the size on every change made on a map.

Chewing through all member is bad.. it will hog a thread for a long time.. it will polute the caches. This is done done periodically to update the management center.

Other data-structures like ICache should be checked as well.
