If you insert a record with a custom `ExpiryPolicy` (using `put(key, value, expiryPolicy)`), then there are two issues if you attempt to access the record-level expiry policy using an `EntryProcessor`:

- `CacheEntryProcessorEntry` seems to always use the cache configuration level ExpiryPolicy and not the record-level one.
- `CacheRecord.getExpiryPolicy()` always returns `null`.
