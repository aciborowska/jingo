`BufferObjectDataInput` and `BufferObjectDataOutput` objects are pooled. While being used for serialization, their `version` may be set, however when `clear`ed so they can be returned to the pool, their version is not reset to `UNKNOWN`; a subsequent take from the pool may return a buffer with its `version` already set.
