Following noctarius request for - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37431300/hazelcast-instance-force-restart

**Description of environment and program:**
I have a 4-node cluster of hazelcast community 3.6.2 running on docker.
My program only monitors the state of the cluster and tries to recover if a connectivity issue is detected.
To identify a problem I use the following:

```
LifecycleService.isRunning()
Cluster.getMembers().size() > 1
Cluster.getClusterState() == ClusterState.ACTIVE
```

**The problem:**
To simulate a full cluster split I'm using docker network disconnect/connect.
After reconnecting, some of the nodes are in `FROZEN` state. The program identifies this and tries to shutdown the node using `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`.
From this point on the only thing I get from the node/s is:

> com.hazelcast.cluster.impl.operations.JoinCheckOperation
> INFO: [172.17.0.3]:5701 [dev] [3.6.2] Ignoring join check from Address[172.17.0.2]:5701, because cluster is in FROZEN state ...

How can I overcome this? My purpose is to to recover all nodes and rebuild the cluster.
Let me know if additional code/logs are needed...
