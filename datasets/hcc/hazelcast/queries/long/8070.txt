_ClusterServiceImpl_ has method shutdownNodes which calls **node.shutdown(false)**. The same applies for _ShutdownNodeOperation_.

Shouldn't it call _LifecycleService_ instead so the proper listeners are invoked before and after?

Cluster shutdown functionality seems really useful but in our case lot of stuff relies on the listeners for deinitialization.
