I started a 6 nodes cluster, each member running with 10gb heap and Elastic Memory (old gen HD) of 240GB. Load the cluster with 30 million entries, each entry approx 4kb in size. 

After the load, start a client and perform some get and set operations in IExecutorService. After all the IExecutorService tasks have finished, disconnect the client. Run GC on all nodes from Man Centre and leave the 6 servers running with nothing else connected to them - perform no operations.

One hour into sitting idle mode, the heap starts increasing. Even when servers are not performing any sort of application operations, the heap keeps increasing and go all the way upto 5GB.

Run GC on all nodes and the heap usage comes down, only to go up again in few minutes. I have attached screenshots from before and after Run GC and thread dumps of all server nodes before Run GC. Thread dumps are in multiple snapshots, at the interval of 1 second.
