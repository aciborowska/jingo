When a MapInterceptor is added during by a code running Hazelcast embedded and that node is stopped, then the interceptor is not removed.

It the node is then started again, the effect of the interceptor is applied twice.

For demonstration of this see the code here:
https://github.com/dirkvanrensburg/hazelcast-mapinterceptor
- Run the main of class: _InterceptorChangeOnGetDemo_
- Look at the console output
- Then run the main of class: _InterceptorChangeOnPutDemo_
- Look at console output to see both Interceptors working
- Stop the VM running _InterceptorChangeOnPutDemo_ and start it again
- Every time _InterceptorChangeOnPutDemo_ is stopped and started, the effect is applied one more time
