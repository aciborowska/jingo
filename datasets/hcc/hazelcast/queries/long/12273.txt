When using HazelcastClient instance to add dynamic MapConfig, It generally works for most of other parameters but **timeToLiveSeconds parameter is always 0**.

I found [getConfig() method in com.hazelcast.client.impl.protocol.task.dynamicconfig.AddMapConfigMessageTask class](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/client/impl/protocol/task/dynamicconfig/AddMapConfigMessageTask.java)
 is called by hazelcast cluster when I add dynamic MapConfig from client, but there is no code for timeToLiveSeconds.

Is it intended?


Hazelcast version : 3.9.2
Cluster size : 1
Number of the clients : 1 (seperated from cluster)
Version of Java : JDK 1.8
Operating system : Windows10 (for development)
Logs and stack traces : N/A
Detailed description of the steps to reproduce your issue : 
 1. Run cluster with default config.
 2. Run client and add dynamic MapConfig with some customized timeToLiveSeconds value using HazelcastClient instance
     ex)  hazelcastClient.getConfig().addMapConfig(mapConfig);
 3. Check config is added
     ex) hazelcastClient.getConfig().getMapConfigs();
 4. You can see mapConfig is added but timeToLiveSeconds is 0
Unit test with the hazelcast.xml file : N/A
integration module versions : Spring Boot 1.5.6 with embedded tomcat
