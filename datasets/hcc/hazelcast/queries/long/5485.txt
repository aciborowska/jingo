The way how issue is reproducible in _our_ environment
- Start _node1_
- Load _node1_ with large number of http requests (each request will result into hundreds of hazelcast operations)
- Starting _node2_ when load is running
- You'll see map size node _node2_ growing above configured max size. Issue is _not_ reproducible if load is applied after node joined.

I was unable to reproduce issue using unit test, however when debugging it looks like check in 
MaxSizeChecker#isEvictablePerNode doesn't succeed (hz. v3.4.2) and number of items returned is less than number if item returned by map.size.

Issue is reproducible on hz 3.3.1 as well.

Would be awesome to know if this is known issue or/and if any workaround exist.
