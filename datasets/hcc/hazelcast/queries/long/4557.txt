After a splitbrain situation the ReplicatedMap is not merged. From user perspective it is very expected to at least see a try to re-sync the content.

The question is what side (which cluster) should try to send data to what other cluster? As far as I remember that was one of the reasons it wasn't implemented since everybody would have to send data to everybody else.
I don't think this is just a basic bugfix that can be done in a few minutes like just implement a listener and we're done. This needs to get some more thoughts.
