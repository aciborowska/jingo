Dynamic configuration currently relies on replication operation to distribute dynamically added configs to new members. This has two consequences:
- dynamic configs are not available in lite members
- the `HazelcastInstance` is returned to the user before the replication operations are done, so a user may create a proxy before the dynamic config is known to the local member.
