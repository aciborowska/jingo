The `EnumSerializer` is registered as a [constant](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/de49652f82e8ab87154bc1a82803531dd1a0ab28/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/internal/serialization/impl/SerializationServiceV1.java#L178) and this means there is no super-class lookup when searching for an interface. 

You can test this by throwing exception from `EnumSerializer` - the `EnumTest` is still passing! There is a silent fallback to Java serialization.
