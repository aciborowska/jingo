In `RestApiFilter#getHttpApiEndpointGroup`, we try to find the appropriate `RestEndpointGroup` for the given URI. If no pattern matches, we return `RestEndpointGroup#CLUSTER_WRITE`. It may happen that the URI is in fact a legacy one and should belong to some other group. Such is the case for some WAN URI's:

```
public static final String LEGACY_URI_WAN_SYNC_MAP = "/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/map";
    public static final String LEGACY_URI_WAN_SYNC_ALL_MAPS = "/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/allmaps";
    public static final String LEGACY_URI_ADD_WAN_CONFIG = "/hazelcast/rest/wan/addWanConfig";
```

These end up in the `RestEndpointGroup#CLUSTER_WRITE` group.
