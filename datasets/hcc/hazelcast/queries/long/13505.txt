there was an [accidental leakage](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12624/files#diff-40036710753e715e2057b19b746aa31fR286) of the `InternalSerializationService`

This effectively exposes the ISS to all DataSerializable users. This is undesirable as `InternalSerializationService` is meant to be .. well, internal :)

It's used to lazy deserialize some JCache config stuff. 

@vbekiaris: "at first glance, it looks like it doesnâ€™t have to be the `InternalSerializationService`, the public `SerializationService` should do as well"
