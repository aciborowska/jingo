I have this configuration (version 1.4.1):

Members [2] {
        Member [myHost]:7004 this
        Member [myHost]:7005
}

The 7004 port is visible from the machine with hazelcast client, 7005 is not visible.

ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           state NEW tcp dpt:7004
REJECT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

This is the client code:

``` java
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig.setInitialConnectionAttemptLimit(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
clientConfig.setReconnectionAttemptLimit(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
clientConfig.setGroupConfig(new GroupConfig("dev", "dev-pass"));
clientConfig.setConnectionTimeout(5000);
clientConfig.setReConnectionTimeOut(5000);

String member = String.format("%s:%d", "myHost", 7004);
clientConfig.setAddresses(Arrays.asList(member));

HazelcastClient instance = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);
instance.getMap("a").put("ab", "ab");
```

When I stop the hazelcast instance running on 7004 and than start it again, the client does not reconnect.

Note: I thing there is a bug in the code. You have to remove the member from cluster members when reconnection fails.
