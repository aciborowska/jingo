When I upgrade [spring dependency](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast-spring/pom.xml) to 4.1.x and build it locally, I receive following exception.

```
src/main/java/com/hazelcast/spring/cache/HazelcastCache.java:[31,7] error: HazelcastCache is not abstract and does not override abstract method putIfAbsent(Object,Object) in Cache
```
