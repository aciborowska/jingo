A high number `EntryEventType[]` are created in a client application which receives many entry events.  In a specific application, `EntryEventType[]` dominates the application's overall memory allocation.

I suspect that this is the result of a leak in `EventryEventType.getByType(final int eventType)`.  That method calls `EntryEventType.values()`, which allocates a new array on each call.  If this suspicion is correct, a fix could be to cache the values array in a private static variable.
