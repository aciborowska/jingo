This [PR](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12429) introduced a [new method](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12429/files#diff-3b1753cbdb6e6b21b7ecd707c83b8897R106) on `ReadResultSet`. 

However it's currently only usable when used to read from [event journal](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/c7700c26915756d3c67476b0a278fdc04eeb0f95/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/internal/journal/EventJournalReadOperation.java#L140-L143)

When you use ringbuffer then the `getNextSequenceToReadFrom()` always return 0.

I suspect it's because the [`ReadManyOperation`](https://github.com/jerrinot/hazelcast/blob/c7700c26915756d3c67476b0a278fdc04eeb0f95/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/ringbuffer/impl/operations/ReadManyOperation.java#L62) fails to call `resultSet.setNextSequenceToReadFrom()`
