This issue is related to #6162 

The class `AbstractEntryProcessor` should adhere to the guidelines set forth in the [Javadoc of EntryBackupProcessor](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/v3.5.3/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/map/EntryBackupProcessor.java#L25-L30) and take into account that `entry.getValue()` might return `null` in the backup processor, although it was not null in the primary processor.
