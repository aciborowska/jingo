In Client Continuous Query Cache, it is expected that updates are pushed to cache either after batchSize is reached or delaySeconds passed, whichever comes first. 
But in some cases it does not push any updates. 

I prepared 2 failing tests in the attached class file. I tested with version 3.8.4 and latest master.
