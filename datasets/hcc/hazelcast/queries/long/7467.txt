I am running multiple Hazelcast 3.5.5 instances in the same JVM. When i programatically shutdown one instance, all other existing instances are also deregistered as JMX Beans, but they are still alive and running. Creating a new instance programatically then only registers the new instance, all others are no longer available via JMX.

All running Hazelcast Instances should always be visible by JMX (if JMX is enabled).
