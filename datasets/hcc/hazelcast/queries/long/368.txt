Hi,
I am trying to use Hazelcast IMap to store Objects which contain attributes (actually down the object graph) which are of Double type. For querying these objects using SQLPredicate on these double values, I have created an index on the same. Like this:
  cache.addIndex("address.currentLocation.longitude", false);

When I query this using a SQLPredicate like below everything works well:
    new SqlPredicate("address.currentLocation.longitude >= 10 AND address.currentLocation.longitude <= 60")

But as soon as I introduce one of the values as negative the values returned don't match up:
    new SqlPredicate("address.currentLocation.longitude >= -10 AND address.currentLocation.longitude <= 60")

Negative zeros also cause the same problem and so does both negative values:
  new SqlPredicate("address.currentLocation.longitude >= -0 AND address.currentLocation.longitude <= 60")

Also tried using BETWEEN

  new SqlPredicate("address.currentLocation.longitude BETWEEN -10 AND 60")

This can be reproduced consistently. Please refer Google groups post: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/hazelcast/eoKFo0OscSY

Please let me know when the fix can be done.
