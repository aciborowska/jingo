HZ 3.6-EA. 
I use custom cridentials class which inherits from UsernamePasswordCredential class. I need to provide some additional auth data from client to server. Till version 3.5.3 it works fine: the custom credentials class was deserialized and used on the server side. In 3.6-EA the standard UsernamePasswordCredential class deserialized instead. Auth message created on the server side is AuthenticationMessageTask, but it must be AuthenticationCustomCredentialsMessageTask, I believe.

Please have a look.
Thanks, Denis.
