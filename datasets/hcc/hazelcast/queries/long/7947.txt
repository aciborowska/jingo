This fails:

``` java
HazelcastInstance client = // client instance
ISet<String> foo = client.getSet("foo@0");
TransactionalTask task = new TransactionalTask() {
    public Object execute(TransactionalTaskContext context) throws TransactionException {
        TransactionalSet<String> foo = context.getSet("foo@0");
        foo.add("Hello");
        return null;
    }
};
client.executeTransaction(task);
assertEquals(1, foo.size());
```

Same code appears to work if executed on a member, _however_ if client submits as task to member, and executes the same on _on the member_, it still doesn't seem to work.

So to summarize, this is probably not exclusive to Set (could have similar issues for other DOs), but it seems isolated to client protocol, transaction, AND partitioned DO names.
