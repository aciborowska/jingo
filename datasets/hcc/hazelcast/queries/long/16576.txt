I'm seeing the following error messages when attempting to communicate with hazelcast:

```
[DefaultLogger] INFO at LifecycleService: HazelcastClient is starting
DefaultLogger] WARN at ClusterService: Error: Client is not active.
[DefaultLogger] WARN at ClusterService: Error: Client is not active.
[DefaultLogger] WARN at ClusterService: Error: Client is not active.

....
```

after 5 minutes I see the following:

```

The basic config within my hazelcast.xml is:
```xml
<network>
        <port auto-increment="true" port-count="100">5701</port>
        <outbound-ports>
            <!--
            Allowed port range when connecting to other nodes.
            0 or * means use system provided port.
            -->
            <ports>0</ports>
        </outbound-ports>
        <join>
            ...
            <aws enabled="true">
                <iam-role>data-infrastructure-ums</iam-role>
                <region>us-east-1</region>
                <host-header>ec2.amazonaws.com</host-header>
                <security-group-name>UMS HAZELCAST</security-group-name>
            </aws>
            ...
            <discovery-strategies>
            </discovery-strategies>
        </join>
        <interfaces enabled="true">
            <interface>172.*.*.*</interface>
        </interfaces>
        <ssl enabled="false"/>
```

If I toggle to aws enabled to false it works fine.  Key take away is I'm using docker compose with all the containers running in the same instance.  I also set `JAVA_OPTS=-Dhazelcast.config=/opt/hazelcast/config_ext/hazelcast.xml -Dhazelcast.local.publicAddress=hazelcast-local:5701` in the docker compose file and seems to work as expected based on logs below.  Is there something else I'm missing?  I even tried to enable interfaces to see if that would solve it based on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47302340/hazelcast-cluster-over-aws-using-docker.  I would truly love for somebody to point me in the right direction.


I'm expected Hazelcast to work fine without issues as it seems to connect fine.  Here are the log messages during connection:

I'm using the hazelcast docker image 3.12.5
The AWS instance I'm using is c5 with 2 cpus and 4 gb.  Also I have the security group and IAM role setup correctly.  I only have one cluster member.
