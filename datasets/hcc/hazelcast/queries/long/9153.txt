Hi,

I'm facing an issue with an IMap distributed on two different nodes.

 I'm using this IMap with :
- only one "**Async Backup**"
- **MaxIdleSeconds** set to 10 seconds.  
- **readBackupData** set to false
- Default **eviction-policy** (NONE)

In the beginning I'm putting some values in the map but after that the values are only accessed and not updated for quite a long period (like 10 or 15 minutes).

What is the problem ?

In the beginning (before 10 seconds elapsed), the backup is working great ...

But after 10 seconds : all the backups are lost !

_If I change the amount of seconds for the MaxIdle property to an higher value (let's say 300 seconds) then everything is working well until 300 seconds._ 

**The backups gets evicted if I use MaxIdle property, is that a normal behavior ?** 

For information : using a "sync" backup didn't solve the problem at all.
The only "workaround"is to use a TTL instead but that's not what I want because my values are not updated for a certain amount of time and I want eviction if not "accessed" for 10 seconds.

I don't have any workaround here and it's quite a severe issue to integrate Hazelcast in our system.
If you want more information, don't hesitate.

Hazelcast version : 3.7.2
