When closing a Hazelcast client by calling `com.hazelcast.client.HazelcastClient.shutdown` I see the following in the client log:

```

```

And the following in the server log:

```
2015-04-01 04:35:47.620 [hz._hzInstance_1_dev.IO.thread-in-2] INFO  com.hazelcast.nio.tcp.TcpIpConnection - [REMOVED] [dev] [3.4] Connection [Address[REMOVED]] lost. Reason: java.io.EOFException[Remote socket closed!]
```

I appreciate that it's a 'feature' of NIO that when the sockets are closed, the handlers waiting on socket events see what looks like an error.  However logging such situations as warnings is misleading.

Add to this the fact that it's common to monitor logs on phrases such as WARN and Exception means the cache is causing alerts under normal usage.

Given this, please review the logging when a client connection is closed.
