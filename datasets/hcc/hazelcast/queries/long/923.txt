In HazelcastClient constructor, when SerializationServiceBuilder is created, PartitionStrategy is not set. Thus, for instance, keys returned by PartitionAware objects are just ignored during serialization at client side, and data put on server is not seen on the client and vice versa. Setting the partition strategy like shown below seems to be fixing the issue. 

serializationService = new SerializationServiceBuilder()
                    .setManagedContext(new HazelcastClientManagedContext(this, config.getManagedContext()))
                    .setClassLoader(config.getClassLoader())
                    .setConfig(config.getSerializationConfig())
