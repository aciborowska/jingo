In a production environment  I ran into a situation where a Hazlecast node seemed to be in multiple clusters at once. 

The cluster was split-brained so there were 3 different masters. When the new node started up it connected to 3 different masters and appeared to successfully join each one. There were no errors or warnings in the logs. The node repeatedly logged at various times (over a period of several minutes) that it was in each of the different clusters. Each of the 3 masters logged that the node was in their member list.

I'll attach a test case that consistently reproduces the situation. The test case causes a node to startup successfully and join three masters at the same time. All three masters then think that the new node is one of their members.
