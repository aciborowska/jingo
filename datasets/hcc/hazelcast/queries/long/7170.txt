We observed in two different runs that InvocationMonitor is checking for the same invocations continuously. You can see the logs of one in the attachment. 

There are continuous `Handled 3 invocation timeouts and 0 backupTimeouts` logs while all of the three invocations checks are returning `is-executing': false`.

It seems the invocations in the `invocationRegistry` left deregistered for some reason.
