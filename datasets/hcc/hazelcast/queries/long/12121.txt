The types array misses multiple top-level types, e.g. `serializer`. etc. 
Weird thing is that there were even data-structures missing there prior to 3.10, e.g. cardinalityEstimator. I don't know how/if `HazelcastNamespaceHandler` is used at all. 
This PR #12112 adds some of them, but there are still multiple missing.


It needs to be verified.
