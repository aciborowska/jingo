Problem:

No of members in cluster : 1
For Hazelcast server we  configured 32 GB as heap memory size. USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE was set to 10% . Eviction should happen once heap crosses approximately 3.2 GB mark .

Cache configuration:

```
           <map name="Cache1">
                                            <in-memory-format>BINARY</in-memory-format>      
                                            <backup-count>0</backup-count>        
                                            <async-backup-count>1</async-backup-count>              
                                            <max-size policy="USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE">10</max-size>
                                            <eviction-policy>LFU</eviction-policy>
                                            <eviction-percentage>1</eviction-percentage>              
                                            <merge-policy> com.hazelcast.map.merge.HigherHitsMapMergePolicy</merge-policy>             
                                            </map>                                               
```

We populated Cache1 with entries, and  when hazelcast server JVM  crossed 4 GB size, the totalEvictedEntryCount in JConsole was still 0 for Cache1.

Then we  added more entries to Cache1 and when localOwnedEntryMemoryCost crossed 3.2GB mark , the eviction happened as per the configuration(1% eviction percentage) of the cache.

This behaviour could not be verified using Management Centre as ManCentre itself shows quite heap usage, even when no data is stored in Hazelcast server.
