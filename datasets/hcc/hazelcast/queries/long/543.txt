We have encountered a possible memory leak with the Hazelcast C# Cient.

I have written two simple projects which reproduce the problem - a Java one to spin up a simple Hazelcast instance and a C# one to demonstrate the OutOfMemoryException, which should hopefully be sufficient for you to diagnose the problem. Unfortunately these attachments are being rejected as illegal attachments by your email server, could you please advise on the best way to get them to you?

Best regards,

Nick
