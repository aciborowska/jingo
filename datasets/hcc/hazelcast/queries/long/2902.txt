I have a `MapConfig` like this:

``` java
new MapConfig(HttpSession.class.getName())
            .setAsyncBackupCount(1)
            .setBackupCount(0)
            .setMaxIdleSeconds((int) TimeUnit.MINUTES.toSeconds(30))
```

I can see in Hazelcast Management Center that entries in the map are being removed, but the backup count is continuously increasing. I'm not sure whether this would also affect synchronous backups (which is to say I have not directly tested that), but I'd imagine it probably does.
