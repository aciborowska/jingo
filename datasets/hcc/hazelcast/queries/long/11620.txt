When I try a rolling upgrade `3.8.6->3.9`, with the `cluster.sh` script and some member is still running 3.8.6, then the scripts output is:

```bash
$ ./cluster.sh -o change-cluster-version -v 3.9 -a 172.17.0.4
No port is defined, running script with default port : '5701'.
No groupname is defined, running script with default groupname : 'dev'.
No password is defined, running script with default password : 'dev-pass'.
Changing cluster version to 3.9 on ip 172.17.0.4 on port 5701
Cluster is in {, change failed.
```

The last printed line is wrong because an incorrect `sed` expresions are used to parse a version from the server response. IMO the message received from server should be used instead. The server response seems like:

```json
{"status":"fail","message":"Node's codebase version 3.8.6 is incompatible with the requested cluster version 3.9"}
```
