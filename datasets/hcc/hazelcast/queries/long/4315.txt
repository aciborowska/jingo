@fuadm came up with an issue with the pattern matching in Config.java

Since the actual wildcard search always does a "contains"-matching you cannot set a configuration for e.g. "startsWith". So a pattern like

```
MapConfig mc = cfg.getMapConfig("bc.*");
```

will also match for the map

```
IMap map = instance1.getMap("abc.xyz");
```

A solution would be to switch to regex matching, but this would break the documented way how to use wildcards ("regex .*" vs. "documentaion *").
