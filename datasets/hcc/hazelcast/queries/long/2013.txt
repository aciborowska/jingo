Hello,

I started noticing `ClassCastExceptions` during my hazelcast testing when I had an `EntryListener` operating on events generated by `ExecuteOnEntries`.

Looking into the hazelcast code, I discovered that the event was being populated with the result of the `EntryProcessor`, rather than anything set by `entry.setValue()`.

I have a pull request fixing the problem and a unit test that demonstrates it. I'll attach it to this issue when I submit it.

Thanks!
