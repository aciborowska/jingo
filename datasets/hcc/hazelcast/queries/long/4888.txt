In the com.hazelcast.concurrent.lock.LockStoreContainer class when clearLockStore is called the lockStores map entry is not removed.

I have attached screenshot of the heap dump from JVisualVM
![lock_store_heap_dump](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11635278/6811251/cef6ec94-d223-11e4-9aa5-d90f6fdc7c9e.PNG)
. Notice how com.hazelcast.spi.DefaultObjectNamespace and  com.hazelcast.concurrent.lock.LockStoreImpl classes hang around even after the map has been removed.

The lockstore objects pile up till the server finally runs out of memory
