**Describe the bug**
The documentation for Hazelcast 4.0 contains a section for Consul discovery (https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/index.html#consul-cloud-discovery). Due to package changes, this plugin is not compatible with Hazelcast 4.0 anymore.

**Expected behavior**
a) The plugin is fixed
b) The documentation is updated

**Additional context**
Issue in Consul discovery project: https://github.com/bitsofinfo/hazelcast-consul-discovery-spi/issues/33
