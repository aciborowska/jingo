

we have fail's in split heal IMap tests running on master, from 
https://hazelcast-l337.ci.cloudbees.com/view/split/job/split-map/14/consoleFull
and
https://hazelcast-l337.ci.cloudbees.com/view/icmp/job/block-tcp/2/console
we see that we can loose data out of IMap after a few split heal cycles. (edited)

in the logs we can see 
`Retrying invocation: Invocation{op=com.hazelcast.map.impl.operation.MergeOperation`
`Error while running merge operation: Partition is migrating!`
`Promotion commit failed for 39 migrations since destination [10.0.0.92]:5701 left the cluster`
`Migration failed: MigrationInfo` (edited)


GC look ok http://54.82.84.143/~jenkins/workspace/block-tcp/3.10-SNAPSHOT/2017_12_14-23_42_52/block-tcp/gc.html


and my test cycle is simple http://54.82.84.143/~jenkins/workspace/block-tcp/3.10-SNAPSHOT/2017_12_14-23_42_52/block-tcp/go
waiting until cluster's merged, and become safe before starting next iteration

I don't find any logging for failed ICMP Ping so we can't blame the aws network infrastructure

could the cause be.
after TCP split, we wait for   AA cluster to be size 2  and   BB cluster to be size 3
migration's could still be running in each cluster.  but now the network is healed 
so now more cluster membership changes and migration start,  and we loose the data in this mixed state ?


we could wait until clusters AA and BB are safe, before healing the network, but this dose not represent a worst case
