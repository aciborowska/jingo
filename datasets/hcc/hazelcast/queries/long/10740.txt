Code:
```
com.hazelcast.instance.BuildInfoProvider.getBuildInfo().isEnterprise()
```

With:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-enterprise-all</artifactId>
    <version>3.7.8</version>
</dependency>
```

Expected: true
Returns: false

tested 3.7.5 and 3.7.8: broken
tested 3.8.2: works fine

I did some investigations and the hazelcast-runtime.properties resource embedded in the enterprise distribution simply has:

```
hazelcast.version = 3.7.5
hazelcast.build = 20170124
hazelcast.distribution = Hazelcast
hazelcast.git.revision = 111f332
hazelcast.serialization.version = 1
```

which seems to be the root of the problem.
