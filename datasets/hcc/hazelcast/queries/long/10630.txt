
running a processor test using cluster member kill,  all client hit and GC overhead oome.
the same test in a stable cluster runs to completion.

the test is configured as
https://github.com/hazelcast/hzCmd-bench/tree/master/lab/hz/stable/processor/regular/submit-to-andthen

we loads some data into the maps, and then run regular predicates on the map
using

`map.submitToKey(key, personIncrement).andThen(counter);`


and  code is
