I have a simple HZ 3.5.4 env, 1 client, 1 server. Client perform put/get on server. There is 1 topic between server and client. 1 class on the server side publish messages to the topic and 1 class on the client side receive them. I monitor Topic statistics via JMX. The stats say: localPublishOperatrionCount = 10046. The same is totalMessageCount. These numbers are correct. But localReceiveOperationCount = 65590. I don't see how this is possible.

Please have a look.

Thanks, Denis
