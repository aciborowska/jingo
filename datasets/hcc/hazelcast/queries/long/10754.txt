Hi
We were testing Hazelcast locking capabilities in our dev environment. We created a Spring Boot Application to update a document in Couchbase concurrently. We tested concurrent requests/load on the REST endpoint using JMeter. Underlying App Server used was Tomcat 8. When we run the load test with concurrent users first loading and then updating same document , multiple threads are able to acquire lock on same document id within a span of milliseconds. We tried acquiring the lock by joining Hazelcast cluster as well as Client. Finally when we put the code to acquire lock in synchronised block , multiple threads are not able to acquire the lock on same document Id. But we are not sure whether this is the correct approach. Synchronised block is applicable to only the JVM of that particular Spring App Instance. If we have multiple app instances running , will we come across the same problem agian ?
