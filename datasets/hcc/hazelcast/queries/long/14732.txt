
It seems a client is able to authenticated after a none selector is applied
There is a race between checking if it is applied and disconnecting the clients

http://jenkins.hazelcast.com/view/wan/job/wan-client-failover/16/console
failing with `fail HzMember3BBB untilClientsCount0 hzcmd.ops.UntilClientsCount threadId=0 global.AssertionException: number of clients 1 != 0 in try's=101 interval 4` 
after i have called client Selector "None"
i expect the client count to to be 0.
