Report issue:

When the client reconnects (transition from CONNECTED -> DISCONNECTED -> CONNECTED), the MessageListener added to the client no longer receives messages. However, the MapListener continues to receive map entry events after reconnection. 
The HZ version in use is 3.11.

Scenario details:

1) HZ cluster has 2 members 41 and 43.
2) HZ client is configured as follows:
```
      ClientConnectionStrategyConfig connectionStrategy = clientConfig.getConnectionStrategyConfig();
      ConnectionRetryConfig connectionRetry = connectionStrategy.getConnectionRetryConfig();
      
      connectionStrategy.setAsyncStart(true); // default is false
      connectionStrategy.setReconnectMode(ClientConnectionStrategyConfig.ReconnectMode.ASYNC); // default is OFF
      connectionRetry.setInitialBackoffMillis(1000);
      connectionRetry.setMaxBackoffMillis(1000); // default is 30000
      connectionRetry.setMultiplier(2); // default is 2
      connectionRetry.setFailOnMaxBackoff(false); // default is false. 
      connectionRetry.setJitter(0.2); // default is 0.2
      connectionRetry.setEnabled(true); // default is false
```
3) HZ client is CONNECTED to the cluster via 41 as owner member.
4) MessageListener is successfully registered and is successfully receive messages.
5) MapListener is successfully registered and is successfully receive notification upon add/update/remove entry in the map.
6) Disconnect 41 from the network.
7) HZ client transition from DISCONNECTED to CONNECTED state where 43 is now the owner member. 
8) Add/update/remove entry in the map successfully triggers the MapListener to receive the corresponding event.
9) MessageListener receives nothing when a message is published.

Note that the same issue is observed when the cluster has only one member and the client is reconnected.

Observation
Remove the old message listener and add new message listener works around the problem i.e the new MessageListener starts to receive published messages.
