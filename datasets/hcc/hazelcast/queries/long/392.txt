Hazelcast Version:  2.4

We upgraded to Hazelcast 2.4 recently.  When doing a MultiTask operation we sometimes get a com.hazelcast.impl.Constants$Objects$6 back instead of a Map as expected. 

Here's an example of what we are doing:

``` java
MultiTask<Map> task = new MultiTask<Map>(callable, this.hzInstance.getCluster().getMembers());
this.hzInstance.getExecutorService().execute(task);
Collection<Map> results = task.get();

for (Map m : results) { // ClassCastException here
  // Do something
}
```

java.lang.ClassCastException: com.hazelcast.impl.Constants$Objects$6 cannot be cast to java.util.Map

One team member suspected this is being returned instead of a TimeoutException being thrown.

Is this a new way of handling timeouts or is this possibly a bug?

Thank you in advance for your help,
