If you create a `javax.cache.CacheManager` with the default settings, the underlying `HazelcastInstance` is not shutdown when one call `close` on the `CacheManager`.

Tracking it down in [HazelcastServerCacheManager](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/cache/impl/HazelcastServerCacheManager.java#L204-L208), it looks like it is only disposed if a config location was set.

What's the rationale for that check? How does it translate to the JSR-107 World?
