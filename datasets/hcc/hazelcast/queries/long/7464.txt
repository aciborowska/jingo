I am implementing MapStore.storeAll() for our cluster to periodically backup the maps.
I configured the cluster nodes for write-behind feature, ie put 60sec for testing.
Ran the test, where updated one, two, three map values within a minute.
However, only store() method got called (3 times)
Expected behavior: storeAll() called once per minute with the full map contents.
please, advise.
