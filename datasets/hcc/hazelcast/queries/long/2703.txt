I spent the last hour debugging why a simple NotEquals predicate isn't working. 

Take a look at:
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/34d115e48e015ca6288416da3c9df87062485da0/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/query/impl/IndexImpl.java#L69

If the _newValue_  is an enum then it's stored as an _enum_ in the _recordValues_ map. Right afterwards, _newValue_ is converted to a _String_. The `indexStore.newIndex` is called with a _String_ newValue.

Now an update comes in which updates the record's enum value. `recordValues.remove(key)` returns an _enum oldValue_. We use the _enum oldValue_ to try to remove the previous index (`indexStore.removeIndex(oldValue, key)`) but nothing gets removed because the key is of the wrong type (enum vs String). 

I think the super easy fix would be to move Line 69 below the conversion of enum to string.
