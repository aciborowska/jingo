When hazelcast is built locally by `mvn clean install`, then resulting `hazelcast-all-[version].pom` (in local repo) wrongly contains dependency on `minimal-json`. This happens even the minimal-json classes are correctly included and relocated by Maven shade plugin (done in hazelcast module).

When the hazelcast-all module is built afterwards (`mvn install -rf :hazelcast-all`), then the resulting POM doesn't contain the minimal-json dependency. 

My guess is, it could be caused by Maven Reactor resolving dependencies upfront and not updating it after reduced POM for a module is created. 

The hazelcast-all POMs released in Maven central have correct dependencies (i.e. without the minimal-json).
