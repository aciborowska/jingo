3.10.4 version
hazelcast.xml: 

```xml
<map name="Person@address">
         <backup-count>0</backup-count>
         <async-backup-count>1</async-backup-count>
         <eviction-policy>LFU</eviction-policy>
         <max-size policy="USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE">25</max-size>
    </map>

<map name="Person@info">
        <backup-count>0</backup-count>
        <async-backup-count>1</async-backup-count>
        <eviction-policy>LFU</eviction-policy>
        <max-size policy="USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE">25</max-size>
    </map>
```

after successful start and cluster joining mancenter shows defult configs(press MapConfig button) for both maps "Person@address" and "Person@info".

from the hazelcast sources I see that getMapConfig and findMapConfig works with base name:

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/config/Config.java#L450

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/partition/strategy/StringPartitioningStrategy.java#L39

which splitted by '@' from map name like "Person@address".  In my case the base name is "Person". I have no map configs for "Person" in hazelcast.xml. So, lookupByPattern method 

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/internal/config/ConfigUtils.java#L36

will never find correct config since all matchers expect name patterns splitted by '*' like this one 

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/config/matcher/MatchingPointConfigPatternMatcher.java#L62

after all, I have default map configs for both maps "Person@address" and "Person@info" since getMapConfig has "default" fallback.

Is it works as designed? If so, where is information about "@" logic inside map names?
StringPartitioningStrategy: Works only for string key. Documentation says nothing about map name partitioning strategy or kind of configuration strategy :)

I solve it with:

```xml
<map name="Person">
    <backup-count>0</backup-count>
    <async-backup-count>1</async-backup-count>
    <eviction-policy>LFU</eviction-policy>
    <max-size policy="USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE">25</max-size>
</map>

<map name="Person@address"></map>
<map name="Person@info"></map>
```

but it looks like street magic.... and I want to setup different heap percentage for maps
