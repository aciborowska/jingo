The problem is that the `MapKeyLoader` tracks the state of the loading using a `Future` object.
On eager load that's followed by another load, let's say triggered by the `loadAll` call, the second's load state may/will be set on the same future object. According to the future's contract such call is ignored if the future has `isDone() == true`.  The update happens in the `MapKeyLoader.trackLoading` method.
It doesn't play any role if the result is the same, but if not, this state update will be missed and may result in the client not being notified about a loading exception, etc.
