Gauges read their values only from `ProbeInstance`s that don't exist for dynamic metrics, leading to rendering 0 value for the affected gauges. This was noticed in the `HealthMetric` logs that reported `clientCount` as zero despite the non-zero number of connected clients.

See this extracted snippet from a `HealthMonitor` log: 
```
clientEndpoint.count=944, connection.active.count=0, client.connection.count=0
```
