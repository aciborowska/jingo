Connections are not cleaned up properly and reference to them from `com.hazelcast.client.impl.ClusterViewListenerService.clusterListeningEndpoints` are kept. The keys in the `clusterListeningEndpoints` are `ClientEndpointImpl` instances which have the `connection` field. Majority of these connections is not `alive` anymore.

Each connection keeps a reference to a channel instance, which then holds inbound and outbound pipelines with its buffers.

I don't know where exactly is the problem with not cleaning the connections properly.

What I expect can go wrong is an exception in processing `pushView` which sends messages to all client endpoints:

Once it fails (e.g. connection is closed before the write is called), the executor will stop to work:
