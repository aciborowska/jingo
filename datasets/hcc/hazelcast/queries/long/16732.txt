
in the member jvm freeze and unfreeze test, some times we see clients get a Null value back from a get operation just after a Member jvm is unfrozen, however after we wait until the cluster is the correct size and the cluster is safe, when we check the map size it is also correct. 
so we are only seeing a temporary "data loss"  just after a member jvm is unfrozen.

freeze is     kill -STOP ${pid}
so the jvm is taken off the processor and then later allowed to continue to run.
