On OSX 10.15.2, Java 1.8.0_232, `mvn install` leaves behind two diagnostic files and a password file

```% ls hazelcast/dia* hazelcast/pass*
hazelcast/diagnostics-127.0.0.1_5701-1576616233213-000.log
hazelcast/diagnostics-127.0.0.1_5701-1576616233214-000.log
hazelcast/password.txt
```

The password file isn't ignore by .gitignore, the diagnostic files are. However, for cleanliness, none should be present.
