The lastest hazelcast brought in ClientExceptionFactory due to @sancar did for exception processing. but it failed due to the initialization of hazelcast instance due to the creation of ClientExceptionFactory 
as it should addd jcache api for initialization. so it's better to build the jcache jar into hazelcast (to be the fat one).
@sancar, if you have time, please spare some time and take a look at.
