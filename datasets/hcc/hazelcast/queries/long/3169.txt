We have experienced a NPE in the connectionMarkedAsNotResponsive method in the 3.3-RC3 code branch:

```
java.lang.NullPointerException
  at com.hazelcast.client.connection.nio.ClientConnectionManagerImpl.connectionMarkedAsNotResponsive(ClientConnectionManagerImpl.java:665)
  at com.hazelcast.client.connection.nio.ClientConnection.heartBeatingFailed(ClientConnection.java:385)
  at com.hazelcast.client.connection.nio.ClientConnectionManagerImpl$HeartBeat.run(ClientConnectionManagerImpl.java:637)
  at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(Unknown Source)
  at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(Unknown Source)
  at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)
  at com.hazelcast.util.executor.PoolExecutorThreadFactory$ManagedThread.run(PoolExecutorThreadFactory.java:59)
```

It occurred on our clients when we pulled out the network cable from the network switch between the switch and the server.

I am not entirely sure whether it is the ownerConnection or the endpoint of the ownerConnection that is null in the above situation as I was not able to access the running code during the test.

I assume that it is still the case in 3.3-RC4 as the connectionMarkedAsNotResponsive method has not changed since 3.3-RC3.
