I am integrating Hazelcast in Spring Boot and I found what I think is an inconsistency. If I create the `HazelcastInstance` with the _default_ `newHazelcastInstance` static method then I get an `HazelcastInstance` whose `Config` has a valid `configurationUrl` property.

However, the following code gives me a null `configurationUrl`:

```
Config cfg = new XmlConfigBuilder(url).build();
```

Looking at `XmlConfigBuilder` it doesn't do anything with the parameter (except initializing the input stream). How about specifying the `configurationUrl` as well?
