Original test creates 3 node cluster with expiration policy set to PER_NODE. That mean that original size of map per node was 1/3 of 10000 which is ~3333K (down from original value of 10K because of repartitioning) and junit assertion was successful all the time.

I updated test to account for number of nodes under test so for 3 node cluster there will be 30K entries put. If eviction algo was right, than mean that assertion still should work, however it breaks. 

Probably the simplest scenario to start with is one node - you could see that only around 5% of entries are getting evicted instead of expected 25%.
