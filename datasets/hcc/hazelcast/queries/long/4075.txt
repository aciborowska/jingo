Hi all,

There is a problem with the pagination predicate in the version Hazelcast 3.3.2, 
The Hazelcast map contains 20 data, 
When we try to get the limited data using pagingpredicate (Ex : 10), It is not returning the first 10 data, If I give pagingpredicate.nextPage(), Am getting 10 data where few data are already given in first ten data.
I mean to say If I hit pagingpredicate (Ex: 10), It is not properly returning the first 10 data, It is mixing with the remaing data in the map, It happens even for pagingPredicate.nextPage() too...

Thanks and Regards,
Hari Prasanth.L
