So we need to know the data-structure and the operation. E.g. map, employees, put. Currently we see a useless  message:

```
ClientInvocation{clientMessageType=5, target=address [10.174.77.36]:5705, sendConnection=ClientConnection{alive=true, connectionId=1, socketChannel=DefaultSocketChannelWrapper{soc

ketChannel=java.nio.channels.SocketChannel[connected local=/10.174.77.43:51480 remote=/10.174.77.36:5705]}, remoteEndpoint=[10.174.77.36]:5705, lastReadTime=2017-08-26 15:07:23.569, lastWriteTime=2017-08-26 15:07:23.543, closedTime=neve

r, lastHeartbeatRequested=2017-08-26 15:05:18.511, lastHeartbeatReceived=2017-08-26 15:05:18.511, connected server version=3.8.3}
```

We don't see the:
- type of data-structure (e.g. IMap/ICache etc)
- the name of the data-structure e.g. employees
- the method involved e.g. get

Some of the information can be retrieved by going up the callstack and look for e.g. IMapProxy.get.. But it isn't clear which map is involved. And this approach further breaks down when dealing with an async call because then you get exceptions out of thin air since there is no usable stacktrace and there is no reference to data-structure/name/method. This makes debugging such issues nearly impossible.
