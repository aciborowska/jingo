Listener registration is an async process on client reconnect. When registration is in progress, any operation from the same client can also be done in parallel and it is possible that the client can miss the events of this operation. 

For instance, client did a map.put, and connection between client and server is healthy but it missed the event of map.put. This can be easily seen as a result of system jitter. This is unexpected since it misses the events of its actions.

A related test failure: https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16328, in the logs of test failure we can see the missed events(query-cache logs missed events).
