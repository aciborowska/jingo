After the fix https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15441 we have removed exception stack trace rewrite on the server. 
Since the client proxies do not use correct method (which seems to be `invocationFuture.joinInternal`), the exceptions that come from the remote are thrown with the stack trace on the remote. 

This makes it hard to follow the stack trace. ~~The solution is already available on the member side. This issue is to address the problems on the client-side.~~ See next comment.
