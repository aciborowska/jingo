I have a set of integration tests that create a new Spring container, containing a new Hazelcast instance for each test class. This is using `SpringJUnit4ClassRunner`.

Hazelcast doesn't always shutdown at the end of each test - it stays alive and forms a cluster with the new Hazelcast from the following test. This seems to happen more often with `3.5.2` (vs `3.4.1`). This behaviour means our integration tests often fail.

I realise this is a rather vague bug report - I will try and put together a repeatable test...
