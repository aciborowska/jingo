I am using below setting in my grails-hibernate application:
cache.hazelcast.instance_name = hc_cache

We have 3 databases configured and by default, Hazelcast creates 3 cache instances although the contents are the same across them. On specifying an instance name, it should be creating a single instance with the specified name but it still creates the three instances.
I am using Hazelcast 3.2.6 and Grails 2.2.3
