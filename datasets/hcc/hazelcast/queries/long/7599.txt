The `FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE` eviction policy does not work as documented because the `EvictionChecker` is incorrectly calculating available memory percentage in [`checkFreeHeapPercentageEviction`](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/v3.6/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/map/impl/eviction/EvictionCheckerImpl.java#L152-L157). The method uses:

```
availableMemory / totalMemory
```

But it should likely be using:

```
availableMemory / maxMemory
```

With this calculation, it is possible for the [calculated free heap percentage](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/v3.6/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/map/impl/eviction/EvictionCheckerImpl.java#L156) to be greater than 100.

This is occurring with Hazelcast 3.6.
