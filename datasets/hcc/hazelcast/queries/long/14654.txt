I was running clients and members with `3.12-BETA-1` version locally. I configured client filtering with a blacklist for `127.0.0.1` IP and was expecting my clients to be blacklisted.

* Expected result: client running on the same machine are blocked once the blacklist is applied.
* Actual result: local clients aren't blocked.

The thing is `client.getSocketAddress().getHostName()` in the following line of code returns `localhost` instead of an IP address:
