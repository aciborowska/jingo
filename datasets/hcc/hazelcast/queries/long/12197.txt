
I have this split brain / quorum / protection test,  

which is sometimes passing but more often failing. so the test is intermittently / randomly Failing

I see that the test hangs at 
https://github.com/hazelcast/hzCmd-bench/blob/master/src/main/java/hzcmd/executor/regular/SubmitToAllAndUse.java#L23

and

https://github.com/hazelcast/hzCmd-bench/blob/master/src/main/java/hzcmd/executor/scheduled/ScheduleGetDispose.java#L22

I think it’s just surprising that it hangs. The current master should discard all tasks from the smaller cluster but I am not sure why `future.get()` hangs. Maybe because the task was only in the smaller cluster and discarded? Maybe it’s expected and we should just document it?
So the current master should behave the same way as when the PR is merged and the configured merge policy is `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.DiscardMergePolicy`
