```
<aws enabled=”true”>
<access-key>my-access-key</access-key>
<secret-key>my-secret-key</secret-key>
<region>us-east-1</region>
<host-header>ec2.amazonaws.com</host-header>
<security-group-name>sg-hazelcast</security-group-name>
<tag-key>type</tag-key>
<tag-value>hz-nodes</tag-value>
</aws>
```

when the region is set to "cn-north-1",
server raise a exception:
_java.net.UnknownHostException: ec2.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com_
and the host should be _ec2.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn_.
and when host-header is set to "ec2.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn",
the config does not work.
does hazelcast now version support china region or not ?
