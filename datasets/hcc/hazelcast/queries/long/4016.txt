If you have an IMap with a near cache, accessing the near cache (via get(key)) will not count as an access to the underlying IMap. So, if you have a maxIdleSeconds configured on the IMap, the entry will time out and be evicted even if the near cache is being hit constantly.

I consider this a bug because if I have a value stored in my IMap that is difficult to compute and used very frequently (accessed via the near cache), I don't want it expiring from my map just because I'm using a near cache.

When a near cache is hit, the underlying map should reset the idle time for that key.
