In the following description - 

"The first column lists the nodes with their IPs and ports. The next columns list the loads on each CPU for the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes. The last column (Chart) graphically shows the utilization of CPUs. When you move the mouse cursor on a desired graph, you can see the CPU utilization at the time where the cursor is placed. Graphs under this column shows the CPU utilizations approximately for the last 2 minutes."

There's required more elaborate description of "loads on each CPU". Something like:

The system load average is the sum of the number of runnable entities queued to the available processors and the number of runnable entities running on the available processors averaged over a period of time.
