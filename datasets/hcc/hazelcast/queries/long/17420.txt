`Invocation.initInvocationTarget` throws `MemberLeftException` when  a target member was found earlier but current target member does not exist. For address and partition based invocations this assumption is correct, but not always correct for CP Subsytem's Raft based invocations, when CP persistence is enabled.

_This is not a critical issue, but adds some noise to the logs when Raft invocations are retried._
