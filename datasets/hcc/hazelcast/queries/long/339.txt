I'm usiing Hazelcast 2.4 as Hiberate 3.6.6's second cache. According to Hazelcast manual,  I annotate an entity @Cache(usage =CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_WRITE,region="SSM") , an error occured "UnsupportedOperationException "  when call getConfig() during startup in my webapp. But when I use NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE as CacheConcurrencyStrategy, it works. what's the problem?
