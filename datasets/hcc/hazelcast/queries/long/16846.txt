I'm trying to load Hazelcast from a custom ClassLoader that is not backed by a file. Hazelcast calls ```ClassLoader.findResource``` to read the corresponding service descriptions from the ```.jar``` ```META-INF``` directory (like ```META-INF/services/com.hazelcast.instance.impl.NodeExtension```). Unfortunately, the Hazelcast class ```com.hazelcast.internal.util.ServiceLoader``` first converts the URL to a URI, and then converts it back to a URI. If I return a URL with an associated URLStreamHandler, then that gets lost in the conversion process (because URI doesn't support it).

From the source code, it's not readily apparent why this is the case.

The only workaround seems to be to create a custom URLStreamHandlerFactory in the Jvm.
