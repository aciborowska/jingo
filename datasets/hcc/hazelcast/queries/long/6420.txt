After this PR https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/6301, Backup operation can be read directly as object without reading it first as `Data` temporary. 

However after the backup operation is read (deserialized) as object, if it is decided (at `Backup::beforeRun` so `valid` field is `false`) that current node is not backup of this replica anymore, `Backup::run` returns silently. But before it returns, it should call `onExecutionFailure` of the backup operation otherwise it causes native memory leaks due to undisposed native memory.
