Hello, 
we have two members in a HZ cluster. we use IQueue with

backup-count=1

and we add programmatically an ItemListener withing a static initializer. 

this queue is used to pub / consume event from-to different parts of the system

in a failover scenario where one of the nodes is shutdown and then resumed, we observe some of the events pushed to the queue dont trigger the listener, which is not invoked. 
Is there something we are missing eg something we need to do in the lifecycle of the node, or maybe a known issue? 
Thanks
TM
