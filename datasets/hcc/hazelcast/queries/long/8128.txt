This class is used by multiple threads, so a method call like this:

```
  public void incrementGets(long latency) {
        GET_COUNT.incrementAndGet(this);
        TOTAL_GET_LATENCIES.addAndGet(this, latency);
        MAX_GET_LATENCY.set(this, Math.max(maxGetLatency, latency));
    }
```

Is racy. If 2 calls come in at the same time with a latency higher than the maxGetLatency, it can be that the highest latency gets overwritten by a lower latency and therefor the highest measured latency can get lost.
