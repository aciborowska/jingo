`instance.getConfig()` will give you a configuration object which happily allow mutations, but they are ignored. 

Hazelcast 3.9 allow to submit new configurations. All other mutation methods should throw UOE. 

Concern: Compatibility. For example WAN calls `addWanConfig()` on a config object while a member is already running.
