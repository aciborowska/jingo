Issues with operation-related `MultiMap` stats:
- Client-triggered operation invocations are not reflected in `LocalMultiMapStat` operation counts.
- Other operations count in `MultiMap` statistics report per partition instead of reporting the number of user calls. This is an analog issue to the one previously fixed by https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/5af07e2b8512d7600decda0f4c4470963fd8933f in `IMap`.

Possibly other data structures - such as `ReplicatedMap` - are also affected, look for `LocalInstanceStats` descendants and all `get*OperationCount` methods. This issue is hidden because of tests for these statistics are incomplete or not existing. These tests need to be completed/written to ensure the stats are gathered in a consistent way. See `LocalMapStatsTest` and its client and HD-specific variants.

Labeled with `4.0`, but it would make sense to backport the fix(es) when done.
