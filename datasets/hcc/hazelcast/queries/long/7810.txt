Hi, 

We are trying to update hazelcast from 3.4 to 3.6.1, but we are repeatedly getting this issue.
`Factory method [public static com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance com.hazelcast.instance.HazelcastInstanceFactory.newHazelcastInstance(com.hazelcast.config.Config)] threw exception; nested exception is java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/cache/integration/CacheLoaderException`

How can we resolve this issue?
