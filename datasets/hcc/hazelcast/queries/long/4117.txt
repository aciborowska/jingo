Hi, I have try version 3.2.1 3.2.6 and 3.3.3, I found the topic will cause a memory leak problem.

here is the example of the reference incomming map:

these object are add as a listener of two topic(com.hazelcast.core.ITopic.addMessageListener(MessageListener<E>)), but after the object call topic.destroy(com.hazelcast.core.ITopic.addMessageListener(MessageListener<E>)), we found the object is still referenced by the these topic class, so these objects will always keep in the memory, which make a memory leak problem.

we have try to remove use the topic, then the problem gone, so we are sure that the problem is because of the hazelcast topic.
