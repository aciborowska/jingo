Hey folks,

Hazelcast shades [Jackson 2.9.7](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/pom.xml#L91), which currently is [about 2 years old](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9.7). There's a lot of Jackson CVEs out there (https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2814 is the latest that popped up for us), often centered around gadgets, as explained by cowtowncoder (primary Jackson maintainer) himself in [this medium article](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062).

It is possible that Hazelcast is affected by CVE-2020-24616, though it looks unlikely to me, you don't seem to be using Anteros-DBCP. It is possible that Hazelcast is affected by one of the other Jackson-targeting CVEs, which I could see being exploited in ways similar to #802. 

Nevertheless and since this is a 2 y.o version anyway, would it be a reasonable goal to switch to a newer version such as 2.11 and resolve both these issues?
