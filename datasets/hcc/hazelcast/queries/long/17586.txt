**Describe the bug**
When using `TcpIpJoiner` or `MulticastJoin` methods, everything works correctly,
but when using `networkConfig.getJoin().getDiscoveryConfig().setDiscoveryServiceProvider()` mechanism,
the cluster isn't joined, and the freshly-started node only sees itself.
However, when split brain timeout is reached, the split-brain mechanism is used to join the cluster

**Expected behavior**
Cluster join should happen on startup time instead of waiting for split-brain logic

**To Reproduce**
- pull https://github.com/flowlogix/hazelcast-issues
- in the directory CacheTester run `mvn -Prun test`
- do the same in an additional window and watch the logs

**Additional context**
Hazelcast version is 4.1-SNAPSHOT (latest)
Java 8
Here are the logs from the second node. First node works as expected:
