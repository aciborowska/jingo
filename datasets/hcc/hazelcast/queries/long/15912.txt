As the title says, when client map and replicated map have the same name and if the near cache is on, they share the same near cache, causing an entry accessed from a map to be accessible from replicated map(or vice versa). See the following reproducer. It outputs `b`.

```java
        HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();

        ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();
        config.addNearCacheConfig(new NearCacheConfig("test"));
        HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(config);

        IMap<String, String> map = client.getMap("test");
        ReplicatedMap<String, String> rmap = client.getReplicatedMap("test");

        map.put("a", "b");
        map.get("a");
        System.out.println(rmap.get("a"));
```
