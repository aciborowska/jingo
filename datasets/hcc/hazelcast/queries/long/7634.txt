Here's the map configuration:

```
<hz:map name="cacheName"
                    backup-count="1"
                    max-size="10000"
                    eviction-percentage="0"
                    read-backup-data="true"
                    eviction-policy="LRU"
                    merge-policy="com.hazelcast.map.merge.LatestUpdateMapMergePolicy"
                    time-to-live-seconds="0"
                    >
</hz:map>
```

After reaching max-size of 10000, it starts return null object for newly added values in cache. There seems to be some problem with eviction in hazel-cast. How can I  fetch newly added values?
