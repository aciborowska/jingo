The bounded queue documentation has an incorrect statement suggesting that the size of the bounded queue can be different in each cluster member, when in fact the first member wins.

Also it makes it seem that the `max-size` of the queue can change from 10 to 20 just by adding a new consumer. That is not true.

In addition the text is a but clunky.  I have made a suggested change and will submit it as a pull request for this page of documentations
