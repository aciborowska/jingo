When a request cannot be executed due to a problem (connection error etc.) if the operation redo is enabled, request is retried. Retried operations are offloaded to an executor, but after offloading, user thread still tries to retry the request, this causes anomalies like operations are executed twice or operation  responses cannot be handled correctly etc.
