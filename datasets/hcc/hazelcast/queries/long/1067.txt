Using Hazelcast 3.1, when a global serializer is used, it is only added to the idMap in SerializationServiceImpl when it is used to write (via safeRegister()). If a process connects to an existing cluster and tries to read an error is raised with "There is no suitable de-serializer for type <global serializer typeId>"
