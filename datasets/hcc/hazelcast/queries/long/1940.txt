Hi,

when I set an entry's value from an AbstractEntryProcessor on a map with backup count 1 and a MapStore, I would expect that the value is stored into the MapStore by the node who owns the key, and only updated in memory by the node who was a backup copy. However, the MapStore#store method is called on both the owner of the key and the backup node. 

The behavior is the same in Hazelcast 3.1.6 and 3.2-RC1.

I have attached the source of a small program that can be used to reproduce the problem. It contains a dummy map store implementation whose store method just prints the key-value pair to standard out. Start the main class twice, and you see on standard out that the store method for the one key that is written in the abstract entry processor's process method is executed on both instances.

Kind regards,
Andreas
