I have an EP that does

    entry.setValue(myObject);
    return entry.getValue(myObject)

And a PostProcessingMapStore where the `store(K,V)` method updates the value with the value returned by the RDBMS.

However, the value returned by the EP is the original value passed in to the `store()` method not the updated value changed in the `store()` method

Tested on 3.10.4.
