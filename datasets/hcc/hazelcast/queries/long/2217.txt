Our app tries to connect in the EC2 machine where the Hazelcast is Running. This works as expected.

But, if the Hazelcast server is down for any reason, looks like hazelcast enters in some kind of loop and never came back, causing the whole app deployment to fail due to timeout.

I'm not able to reproduce this in my machine, only in EC2.

### Info:
- Hazelcast Version: 3.2
- Client version: 3.2 (java)
- App: Java EE 6 application, running on jBoss AS 7 with jRockit 6.
