Imagine you have the following queue

[1,2,3,4,5]

and you do tx{
  q.poll // 1
  q.poll // 2
  tx.abort
} 

Then the queue content could become [2,1,3,4,5]

The reason is that the QueueContainer doesn't rollback the changes in the oposite order of being added. It is a random order due to the fact that the changes are stored in a hashmap.
