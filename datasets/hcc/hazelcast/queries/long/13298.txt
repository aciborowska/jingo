**Pre-Condition**

HC cluster with 2 nodes, running as embedded servers. There is a health monitoring script on each of the nodes which connect to the server port 5701 using `nc` every half minute, disconnects after 1 seconds without sending anything.

There are 2 clients connecting to the cluster using Java client. A 1-second timeout is set for all the operations performed by those clients.

**Scenario**

There is a high chance client-side operation would slow down around the time when `nc` on server instance tries to connect and disconnect, causing client procedure to timeout.

This scenario is replicable in different network and server setups on our side.

**Expected Result**

As the health check is not even trying to connect to server port in a malicious way, it is expected that this should not affect normal client-side operation.
