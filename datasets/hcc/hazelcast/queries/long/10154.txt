## Info
- Hazelcast version : 3.7.2
- Cluster size : 1
- Number of clients: 1
- Java version: 8
- OS: Windows 10
- Hibernate version: 5.1.1
- Spring version: 4.3.2
## Description of the problem
Setting up a Hazelcast listener in a Spring configuration format does not seem to work when using the class property of hz:listener. More specifically in the file hazelcast-context:
```xml
<hz:client ...>
...
<hz:listeners>
    <hz:listener implementation="<BeanID>"/>
...
</hz:client>
...
<bean class="<BeanClass>" id="<BeanClass>"/> 
```
This configuration successfully registers  `BeanClass` as an event listener while the one below does not:
```xml
<hz:client ...>
...
<hz:listeners>
    <hz:listener class-name="<BeanID>"/>
...
</hz:client>
```

I don't understand why this is the case, the [documentation](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.6/manual/html-single/index.html#listening-for-lifecycle-events) seems to imply that this should be possible.
