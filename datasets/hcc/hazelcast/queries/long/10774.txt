Hi, I am running hazelcast (3.8.2) on 3 servers and using ringbuffer for storing data. Ringbuffer has capacity 500 and no backup. 

I am using addAllAsync(dataCollection, OverflowPolicy.OVERWRITE) for storing data in just 1 thread in whole cluster. This thread calls this method one times per second and stores collection with up to 500 entries.

Reading is performed by more threads in parallel using readManyAsync() method.

And sometimes after node outage get headSequence and tailSequence out of sync as you can see on attached image.

And it seems that version 3.7.8 does not have this problem.
