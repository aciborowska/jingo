Hazelcast binds to a wrong network interface in some cases. The problem is with network interfaces which are not `UP` (e.g. Docker uses such interface for in-host communication).  

The problem is in  `DefaultAddressPicker` class which doesn't check network interface status. The   `DefaultAddressPicker` is responsible for selecting a network interface for Hazelcast. It picks the first available non-loopback IP address.

**Suggested fix**
Change the `DefaultAddressPicker` implementation so it filters out network interfaces which are:
* `DOWN`
* or `loopback`
* or `virtual`
