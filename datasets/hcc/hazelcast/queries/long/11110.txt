`ICache.getAndRemove()` doesn't invalidate the Near Cache when called from the Near Cache side. I noticed this while adding more variants of the `remove()` and `delete()` methods to the Near Cache tests. The failures are all on the `onNearCacheAdapter` method and in the `ClientNearCacheBasicTest`. That's a good indication that a call to the `NearCachedClientCacheProxy` is missing, which invalidates the Near Cache locally.
