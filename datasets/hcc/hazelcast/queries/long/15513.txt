Greetings Hazelcast Development team,
The below code worked in Hazelcast version 3.8.9.  After the upgrade to 3.12.1, a server that should not have the lock proceeds through the if statement.  We have a dump servlet that confirms that the members are seeing each other.

```java
hazelLocks = HazelcastFactory.getInstance().getMapLock();
InetSocketAddress hostMachine =  hazelcastInstance1.getCluster().getLocalMember().getInetSocketAddress();
String hostName = context.getEnvironmentName() + hostMachine.getAddress().toString();
File file1 = new File(fileString);
if (hazelLocks.tryLock(envName+ "-" + dirName)) { // we got the lock
      try {
        //Do stuff
        }
       catch(...){
       //Do more stuff
        }
```

Thank you,
James.
