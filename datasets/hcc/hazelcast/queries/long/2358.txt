Using Hazelcast 3.2, for a distributed map, when a node in a hazelcast cluster is brought down we are seeing on a second node that is still part of the team, the entry event getMember is null.   The second node modifies the map, gets an event on the registered listener and com.hazelcast.core.EntryEvent getMember is returning null causing a null pointer exception to be thrown and caught by a hazelcast thread.
