26 of 27 tests failed

Also tried to manually telnet into hazelcast and issue commands, only 2 commands works; get and delete (set key without flag fails) commands.

So far, following basic command implementations are missing or completely broken; (source tree seems to indicate memcache class wasn't even updated in years.)

stats <arg> items, slabs etc...
add
replace
append
prepend
cas
incr
decr
touch
slabs
flush
