Two nodes both constructed as follows,
```
   Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(new Config());
```
can give this error:
```
WARNING: [192.168.99.1]:5702 [dev] [3.10.5] Config seed port is 5701 and cluster size is 1. Some of the ports seem occupied!
```

Seems to be caused by VirtualBox host only networking, the clue here 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46341715/hazelcast-multicast-does-not-work-because-of-vboxnet-which-is-used-by-docker-mac

Output of this `vboxmanage list hostonlyifs | grep -c ^Name` is not zero.
Run `vboxmanage hostonlyif remove vboxnet0` for the relevant network solves.

Do we have a way to detect when this is the cause and produce a better diagnostic?

It's hardly easy clustering otherwise, and difficult to trace the route cause.
