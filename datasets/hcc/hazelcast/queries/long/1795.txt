The implementation of `DefaultRecordStore#removeAll` (as invoked in turn by `IMap#clear`) assembles a list of key objects to be deleted from the store. It assembles the current key objects in a `HashSet` before passing them all on for deletion.

The problem is that this triggers execution of `hashCode` and `equals` on the key objects. We have an `IMap` containing keys that are Hibernate2 entities, and calling `hashCode`/`equals` during the `IMap#clear` operation causes lazy-init excerptions to be thrown from within Hibernate.

I suggest that the `keysObject` collection in `DefaultRecordStore#removeAll` be changed to assemble the keys in an `ArrayList` rather than a `HashSet`.  They don't need to be kept in a `Set`, any old `Collection` will do.
