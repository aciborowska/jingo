Currently, while creating `CacheManager` backed by custom hazelcast instance from given config file, regardless from instance name is specified or not in the config file, instance name is set as config url but when there is specified instance name in the config file, that instance name should be used instead of config url.

Also, it would be better to specify instance name via `(HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME` property when instance config is taken from specified config file via `HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_CONFIG_LOCATION`.
