**Describe the bug**
The IExecutorService.submitToKeyOwner should honour an object that implements the PartitionKey interface. If you use an object that implements the PartitionKey interface as the key to an IMap and then attempt to use the same key object as the Object key to the executor submitToKeyOwner the request will be sent to the wrong node.

The client interface does not check for the PartitionKey interface and uses the serialised key value to select the partition.

**Expected behavior**
The submitToKeyOwner sends the request to the partition as returned by the PartitionKey.getPartition function.

This was validated on Hazelcast 4.0.1
