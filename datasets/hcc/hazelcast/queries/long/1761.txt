Here's the step to reproduce this bug in hazelcast 2.6.6:
1. start node 1
2. modify an object in node-1 --> dirtyEntryCount = 1
3. start node 2
4. the modified object gets migrated from node 1 to the node 2
The node 1 dirtyEntryCount becomes 0 and the node 2 dirtyEntryCount becomes 1, but the value is never written to the DB
