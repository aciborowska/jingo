Running Hazelcast 2.3.1 with Tcp/Ip enabled and Multicast disabled.

NodeA was the master, became disconnected from the rest of the cluster, and formed a cluster of one.

The network connection came back so that NodeA could communicate with all of the other nodes.

NodeA never rejoined the other cluster.

I turned up the logging level to TRACE and watched the logs for a while but there were no "NodeA is connecting to NodeB" messages to indicate that NodeA was looking for the other cluster.

I ran this code on NodeA and it successfully joined the rest of the cluster:

``` java
hazelcastInstance.getLifecycleService().restart()
```

This seems to indicate that NodeA had a member list and config that would allow it to rejoin and it just chose not to for some reason.

I have been unable to reproduce this in a unit test.
