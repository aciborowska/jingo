Platform : Filter based web session replication

2xTomcat with Hazelcast Filter enabled war.
Grab a session and perform isNew check.  Then kill the tomcat server and restart.
You can get the correct sessionID back but if you perform an isNew check it returns true.

It seems as if the com.hazelcast.web.WebFilter.HazelcastHttpSession.isNew() only checks the containers http session and does not check in the hazelcast cache.  Obviously on tomcat restart this container session will return true.

This fails against 3.3-RC2
