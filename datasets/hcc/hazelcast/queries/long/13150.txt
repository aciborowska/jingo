It appears the Rest interface - in some cases - still sends HTTP 200 even when the operation failed. 
Example: [Change cluster version](https://github.com/jerrinot/hazelcast/blob/e9b80f83326a22ce1bc1f49045c3873e70b8ad39/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/internal/ascii/rest/HttpPostCommandProcessor.java#L159-L182)

When there is an exception during a version change then the stacktrace is part of the response body, but Hazelcast still returns HTTP 200. This makes the Rest API hard to use in cluster automation.
