Hi,
I am facing an issue while starting Hazelcast using `start.sh`. As per my observation, `start.sh` can't handle white space in the file path properly. Due to this, start script exits with following error -

```
lg@lg-System-Product-Name:~/RMH/Practice Projects/Runtime softwares/hazelcast-3.7.1/bin$ ./start.sh
JAVA_HOME found at /opt/jdk8
Path to Java : /opt/jdk8/bin/java
start.sh: 43: export: Projects/Runtime: bad variable name
```

I found that the problem is caused by following `line 43`

```
export CLASSPATH=$HAZELCAST_HOME/lib/hazelcast-all-3.7.1.jar
```

and just wrapping the value part in `"` fixes the issue

```
export CLASSPATH="$HAZELCAST_HOME/lib/hazelcast-all-3.7.1.jar"
```

I am using `Hazelcast v3.7.1` on `Ubuntu 16.04`

It works fine on Windows because Windows version of the script already wraps the classpath in `"`

```
start "hazelcast" "%RUN_JAVA%" %JAVA_OPTS% -cp "%CLASSPATH%" "com.hazelcast.core.server.StartServer"

```
