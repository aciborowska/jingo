We faced the situation that ones Hazelcast cluster becomes unstable/broken, any thread that attempts to check Hazelcast health status via com.hazelcast.instance.LifecycleServiceImpl.isRunning() gets BLOCKED as there is a single thread running com.hazelcast.instance.LifecycleServiceImpl.runUnderLifecycleLock() that seems to never release that lock.

This leads to thousands of threads being BLOCKED at that location until system becomes unresponsive.

Instead of using a synchronized block, the check may be implemented through utilizing an AtomicXYZ variable. Thus a quick check for Hazelcast life status does not block.
