After migration, `ICacheService` clears `ICacheRecordStore` instances related with migrated partitions.

`AbstractCacheRecordStore` has a boolean field named `isOwner` and this flag represents that partition, has this record store, is primary or backup. If it is backup, events and invalidation messages are ignored. 

So far so good, but while record store is being cleared after migration, this field should be updated by checking that current node is the owner of the partition or not anymore. 

A new `reset` method can be added `ICacheRecordStore` and this is called by `ICacheService` instead of `clear` so this reset method can be implemented inside `AbstractCacheRecordStore` by calling `clear` first and then updating `isOwner` field.
