`PartitionTargetCallableRequest` deserialize the callable -> deserialiation set the HazelcastInstance -> Hazelcast instance is not serializable -> https://github.com/jerrinot/hazelcast/blob/5e4741568079cbde4c244a0aba40b434c38c0ffb/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/executor/impl/client/PartitionTargetCallableRequest.java#L79-79 throws  exception.

Reproducer:

``` java
public class ClientMapCallableTest extends HazelcastTestSupport {

    private final TestHazelcastFactory hazelcastFactory = new TestHazelcastFactory();
    private HazelcastInstance client;
    private HazelcastInstance server;

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        server = hazelcastFactory.newHazelcastInstance();
        client = hazelcastFactory.newHazelcastClient();
    }

    @After
    public void tearDown() {
        hazelcastFactory.terminateAll();
    }

    @Test
    public void submitToAllMembers_whenTaskIsHazelcastInstanceAware_thenDoNotThrowException() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        IExecutorService executorService = client.getExecutorService(randomName());
        Map<Member, Future> memberFutureMap = executorService.submitToAllMembers(new MyCallable());
        FutureUtil.allDone(memberFutureMap.values());
    }

    private static class MyCallable implements Callable, HazelcastInstanceAware, Serializable {
        private HazelcastInstance instance;

        @Override
        public String call() throws Exception {
            return "foo";
        }

        @Override
        public void setHazelcastInstance(HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance) {
            this.instance = hazelcastInstance;
        }
    }

}
```
