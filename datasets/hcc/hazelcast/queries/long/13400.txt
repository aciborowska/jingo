Attribute Extractor does not use User Code Deployment to search extractor implementation. See [this question](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hazelcast/0hp7-_PyNmg) for details. 

This is the culprit: Extractors are constructed using the classloader which was [configured by the user](https://github.com/jerrinot/hazelcast/blob/d2800fbe4cfa3a66ad1ba395385cfb9c3bcaacbf/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/map/impl/MapContainer.java#L134) (=it's null in most of cases). However this bypass the classloader for dynamic class loading.
