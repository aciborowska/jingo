We lack a test to ensure`ClientDynamicClusterConfig` overrides all methods. Each new config method introduced in 3.10 must be overridden in the client-side dynamic config support class; it may only make sense to address this once all new config's are in place for 3.10, as each new config will require additional methods in the `DynamicConfigTemplate` in `hazelcast-client-protocol`.
