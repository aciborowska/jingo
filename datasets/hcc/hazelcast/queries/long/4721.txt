I have two nodes with default configs.
If I start one node, then after some time start another - everything works.
But if I start one node, load it with some data (5000 entries to one map, overall 865 kbytes) and then start another node - they can't see each other. Nothing is shown in logs, no attempts to connect, second node starts as if the first node wasn't running at all.
I tried increasing `multicast-timeout-seconds` to 10 seconds - no effect.

Update: tried switching to TCP/IP discovery - bug is not reproduced
