If only one cluster member is running, everything works fine.

If i startup another cluster node. The cluster comes unresponsive for about 5-10 minutes . In log i see many lines with this message:

Backup partition version is not matching version of the owner -> 1728 -vs- 1729

After some time the cluster is working, but still i get some of those info lines.

Never had those problems on 2.6 if a cluster is joining
