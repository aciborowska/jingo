It doesn't make a lot of sense to use an pagingPredicate in an entry listener, but the code doesn't defend against it.

But on 3:12.3, this code throws an NPE:

```
public class Application implements EntryAddedListener {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Application application = new Application();
		application.go();
	}
	
	void go() {
		HazelcastInstance hazelcastServer = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
		HazelcastInstance hazelcastClient = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient();
		
		Predicate predicate = Predicates.alwaysTrue();
		PagingPredicate pagingPredicate = new PagingPredicate(predicate, 1);
		
		hazelcastClient.getMap("anything").addEntryListener(this, pagingPredicate, true);
		
		hazelcastClient.shutdown();
		hazelcastServer.shutdown();
	}

	public void entryAdded(EntryEvent event) {
		// No-op
	}
}
```
