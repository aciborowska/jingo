Hi,
I have a big map (650 000 entries) with store configuration and max size policy for eviction.
when loading the map from an instance of hazelcast I get this warning, that come back recucively until the application crash:

```
[WARN] 2014-11-11 18:30:57,077 [hz._hzInstance_1_dev.partition-operation.thread-1] c.h.s.i.BasicInvocation - [127.0.0.1]:5701 [dev] [3.3] Retrying invocation: BasicInvocation{ serviceName='hz:impl:mapService', op=PutAllOperation{}, partitionId=241, replicaIndex=0, tryCount=250, tryPauseMillis=500, invokeCount=150, callTimeout=60000, target=Address[127.0.0.1]:5701}, Reason: com.hazelcast.spi.exception.RetryableHazelcastException: Map is not ready!!!
```

When disabling the max size policy (in my case is PER_NODE policy) with eager load of the map the application never starts.
here's the configuration : 

evictionPolicy=LRU  
maxSizePolicy=PER_NODE  
maxSize=30000  
evictionPercentage=25  
initialLoadMode=EAGER   

Thanks in advance
