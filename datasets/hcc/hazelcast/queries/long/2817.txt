Trying to run the example client as per the documentation (or the client.sh file) results in a failure:
Error: Could not find or load main class com.hazelcast.client.examples.ClientTestApp

Checking in the hazelcast-client code, I can see that this class does not exist. Has it been moved somewhere else?
