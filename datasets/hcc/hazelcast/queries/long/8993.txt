3.7.2,  3.8-SANPSHOT

This nightly build
https://hazelcast-l337.ci.cloudbees.com/view/shutdown/job/shutdown-queue/

e.g. https://hazelcast-l337.ci.cloudbees.com/view/shutdown/job/shutdown-queue/2/console
Is Failing with

```
HzMember1HZ validate hz.queue.Assert threadId=0 global.AssertionException: queueZ2-offer=9877 != queueZ2-poll=9876 
```

A version of this test, with out cluster manipulation, seems to pass with out issue, 3 of 3.
however with cluster manipulation (cluster member shutdown) we take less items than offered.

e.g. https://hazelcast-l337.ci.cloudbees.com/view/shutdown/job/shutdown-queue/4/console

```
HzMember1HZ validate hz.queue.Assert threadId=0 global.AssertionException: queueZ12-offer=2042 != queueZ12-poll=2041
```

we can see that the first queues with names queueZ0 to queueZ11  offered and took the same number of items.

using a 4 member cluster and 4 clients, over 4 ec2 boxes.
- we make offers to 200 named queues at random, from Client1 using 1 thread,  using a timeout.
- we randomly poll the 200 queues, from all 4 clients using 1 thread,  using a time out.

At the end all polling clients, pause, and poll each queue while it has items. in an effort to catch the last items in the queue.

test offer

test poll
https://github.com/Danny-Hazelcast/hzCmd-bench/blob/master/src/main/java/hz/queue/Poll.java#L35
we are pausing, and polling repeatedly all the queues, to catch last items offered.

 I have seen a 2nd Fail mode. 
https://hazelcast-l337.ci.cloudbees.com/view/shutdown/job/shutdown-queue/3/
where 1 of clients fails to return from the call to poll / offer. and so the test hangs.
I have only seen this in the cluster shutdown case.
