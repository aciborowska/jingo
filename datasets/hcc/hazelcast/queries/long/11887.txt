This is an operation that runs 'offloaded' so without special assistance, it isn't visible and therefor heartbeats are not send. So if it runs for a long period, the migration could fail with the dreaded OperationTimeoutException even though there is no real problem. 

In the 3.10 branch this will be fixed by using the new 'Offloaded' that takes care of registration for the sake of heartbeats. But we need to find a temporary solution that works on 3.9 and older.
