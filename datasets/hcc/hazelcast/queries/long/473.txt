I had some problems using SQLPredicate with date... I checked the code (even if the available formats were clear in exception message), DateHelper.java and I have seen:

static final String timestampFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss.SSS";
static final String dateFormat = "EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss zzz yyyy";
static final String sqlDateFormat = "yyyy-mm-dd";  

Well, it lloks like a bug, assuming you're using SimpleDateFormatter of JDK. In the timestampFormat, you put hours with "hh" but there is nay possibility to force Am/pm marker.
In the sqlDateFormat, you put months with "mm" but there are "Minute in hour"..

Thanks a lot for support. CIAO
