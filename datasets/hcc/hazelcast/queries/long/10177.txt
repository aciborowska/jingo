`hazelcast.jar` contains the files `release_notes.txt` and `changelog.txt`. When we shade `hazelcast.jar` into `hazelcast-jet`, results in an awkward situation where `hazelcast-jet` contains release notes for Hazelcast. These text files should not be included in the JAR itself, but just in the distribution package.
