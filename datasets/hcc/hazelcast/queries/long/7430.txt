For clients, `InitialMembershipListener.init` is called _after_ all `MembershipListener.memberAdded`, which contradicts the docs: 

> The InitializingMembershipListener is a `MembershipListener` that first receives a `InitialMembershipEvent` when it is registered so it immediately knows which members are available. After that event has been received, it will receive the normal MembershipEvents

For members, `InitialMembershipListener.init` is called immediately, but `getMembers` only contains itself, which also seems to contradict the intent described in the docs.
