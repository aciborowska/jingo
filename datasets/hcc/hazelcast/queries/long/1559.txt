The following code reproduces the issue:

```
HazelcastInstance cluster = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();       
IQueue<String> queue = cluster.getQueue("test");
while (true) {
    for (int i=0; i<10000; i++) {
        queue.poll(1, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
    }
    queue.offer("test");    
}
```

It is caused by resources not being cleaned when there is a backup aware call with a timeout that runs into a timeout.
