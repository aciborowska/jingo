when using SQLPredicate in the localKeySet method we noticed, that we get the same key on different nodes. 

The problem seems to be, that keys that are migrated to different nodes remain in the index, although they are deleted from the local map on the source node (localKeySet without arguments is correct).

It happens on 2.1, 2.3 and 2.3.1 the only difference is, that 2.3.1 has a faster migration.

I have created a test case for that problem.
