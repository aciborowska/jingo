```
 * <h1>Smart vs dumb clients</h1>
 * Hazelcast Client enables you to do all Hazelcast operations without being a member of the cluster. Clients can be:
 * <ol>
 * <li>smart: this means that they immediately can send an operation like map.get(key) to the member that owns that
 * specific key.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * dumb: it will connect to a random member in the cluster and send requests to this member. This member then needs
 * to send the request to the correct member.
