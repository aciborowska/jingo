When using slf4j logger with JDK14 logger, the `sourceClassName` and `sourceMethodName` is always set to `com.hazelcast.logging.Slf4jFactory$Slf4jLogger` and `log`. 

The output looks like below with the first log line always being same:

```
May 21, 2019 1:31:49 PM com.hazelcast.logging.Slf4jFactory$Slf4jLogger log
INFO: Loading 'hazelcast-default.xml' from the classpath.

```

I looked around but didn't find an easy way to fix it. The slf4j JDK14 adapter has a `fillCallerData` method where this information is populated, but there doesn't seem to be any way to influence it to ignore certain classes. Needs more investigation.
