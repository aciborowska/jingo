We are seeing some weird behavior from Hazelcast after following these steps:
1. Start a cluster with 2 members
2. Add an object to an IMap where the key of the IMap is a PartitionAwareKey with the key is the same as an attribute on the object
3. Segment the cluster
4. Remove the object from one of the nodes
5. Re-join the cluster (object will be merged back)
6. Remove the object again

At this point, a call to retrieve the object using the PartitionAwareKey will correctly return null; however, using the Predicates API will return the previously deleted object!

As a workaround, removing the index for the attribute that is a part of the key seems to resolve the issue but for my company this attribute is what is queried most often thus we need it fixed.

I tried debugging the issue and it appears IndexService is correctly removing the entry but still the predicate queries return deleted objects.  I have a test case that reproduces the issue I'll be happy to share.
