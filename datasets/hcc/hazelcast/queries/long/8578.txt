Hi,
I am getting the following error for the schema link - 
https://hazelcast.com/schema/spring/hazelcast-spring-3.7.xsd

As a result I am not able to start my application in spring. The spring framework Root Context is breaking during tomcat server start up. I think this is due to the SSL Certificate Problem. Anyone help me on this regard?
