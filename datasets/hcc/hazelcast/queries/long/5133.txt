I brought this up on the google group [0].  However, I think this is a real issue so I decided to go ahead and file the issue.

The following code example fails for me every time on Hazelcast 3.4.2.  If I remove the "map.set" then it passes every time.

```
HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
IMap<Object, Object> map = instance.getMap("map");
map.set("key", "Some Value");
ICompletableFuture f = (ICompletableFuture) map.getAsync("noneexistentkey");
final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
f.andThen(new ExecutionCallback() {
    public void onResponse(Object response) {
        latch.countDown();
    }
    public void onFailure(Throwable t) {
    }
});
if (latch.await(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
    System.out.println("Success");
} else {
    System.out.println("Failure");
}
Hazelcast.shutdownAll();
```
