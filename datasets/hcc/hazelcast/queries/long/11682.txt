I made a test project to try out how the `QueueStore<T>` and the `IQueue<T>` works together, but even though I spent some time with it, I cannot get it to work as I expected. [I uploaded the project here for reference.](https://github.com/SzabKel/HazelcastQueueStoreMemoryLimitTest1)

# Expected

I point to the `QueueStore` when defining the `Config`, set the `Queue` as unlimited and set the `Queue`'s `memory-limit` option to an `N` number. Every time I add an object to my queue, Hazelcast should check If the Queue contains more entries currently than the specified limit. If `TRUE`, it should only add the object to the `QueueStore`, If `FALSE`, it should also add it to the `Queue`. Later, If the `Queue` entries leave the queue, and the size of the queue becomes less than the preset limit, It should reload entries from the `QueueStore`.

# Experienced

The `memory-limit` setting is ignored and the entries are getting inserted into both the store and the queue, even If the limit is reached.

I will happily provide more information if needed.
