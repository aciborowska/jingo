In the Hazelcast 3.0 documentation PDF (Chapter 4. Page 34), the example includes the following code:

public static int removeOrder(long customerId, long orderId) throws Exception { ExecutorService es = instance.getExecutorService();
OrderDeletionTask task = new OrderDeletionTask(customerId, orderId); Future future = es.submit(task);
int remainingOrders = future.get();
return remainingOrders; }

The  instance.getExecutorService() now requires a string, however, I'm unable to find in the documentation what this string does or why it is needed.  In my testing the value of the string does not seem to change behaviour.
