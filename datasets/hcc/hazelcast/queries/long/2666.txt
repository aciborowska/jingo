TTLReachabilityHandler relies on lastUpdateTime property of Record. The property is set as System.nanoTime() when a record is created. 

If a partition is migrated to another JVM then the lastUpdateTime is not guaranteed to have any meaningful sense as according to JDK documentation nanoTime() can be only used to measure elapsed time in a single JVM instance and its not related to any other notion of system or wall-clock time.

On Linux System.nanoTime() uses CLOCK_MONOTONIC and this seems to be related to system boottime -> in renders the expiration logic to be broken.
