Hazelcast version: 1.9.4.8
Environment: Java, Linux

Server side: two nodes backing eachother up. 17 maps defined. Each server has persistence to local disk.
Client side: 16 JVMs, each with one Hazelcast client. 5-90 threads in each JVM access the Hazelcast client, each JVM typically access 1-2 of the 17 maps on the Hazelcast server.

Some of the JVMs encounter situations where the Hazelcast client starts logging to System.out like this:

and this keeps going on (seemingly forever), only solution is to restart the client JVM/application.

I've seen similar problems reported, and the cause has been resolved to be too many client connections (>40 clients, due to 40 being some default thread pool size). But I'm only running 16 clients, so that can't be the reason. Any suggestions?
