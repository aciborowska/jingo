I have configed the join method to use multicast with multicast group address"224.2.2.3", and port "54327", and in most times all members can find each other and join the cluster.

But I met this issue twice that all member can only find itself, they can't find each other to join the cluster, and if I modified the multicast group address to "224.2.2.4", then it works again, so strange...
