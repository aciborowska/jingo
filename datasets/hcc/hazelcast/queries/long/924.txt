Hazelcast 2.6.3

SetUp : one Cluster member and multiple Java clients connected to the cluster

Steps to Repro
Cluster Member implements Client Listener
Clients listen to Map Entries.
Run the cluster and Clients.
Add a map entry and check clients have their listeners triggered
Now disconnect one Client and update the Map
It can be seen that the Map Entry does not invoke listeners in the remaining connected clients.
