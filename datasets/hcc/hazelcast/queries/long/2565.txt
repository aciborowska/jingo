Following is the way config parsing is supposed to work. However if -Dhazelcast.config=classpath:/hazelcast.xml is not actually checking the classpath.

This problem occurs in trunk.

A comprehensive example of Hazelcast configuration.

```
Hazelcast resolves configuration using the following approach:

1. First is checks to see if the ’hazelcast.config’ system property is set. If it is, then the value is used as the path.

   The config option can be set by adding the following to the java command: - Dhazelcast.config=path_to_the_hazelcast.xml.

   The value can be a normal file path, but can also be a classpath reference if it is prefixed with ’classpath:’.

2. Else it checks if there is a ’hazelcast.xml’ in the working directory.

3. After that it checks if there is a ’hazelcast.xml’ in the root of the classpath.

4. If a configuration cannot be found, Hazelcast will use the default hazelcast configuration
   ’hazelcast-default.xml’, which is included in the the Hazelcast jar
```
