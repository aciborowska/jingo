Hello.
The hazelcast-all jar, which is the one included in hazelcast-docker, downloaded from [maven repo](https://github.com/JChrist/hazelcast-docker/blob/master/hazelcast-oss/Dockerfile#L7), contains an [outdated version](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast-all/pom.xml#L159) of hazelcast-aws

Is there some specific reasoning behind this?
