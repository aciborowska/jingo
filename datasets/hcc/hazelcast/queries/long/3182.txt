Currently, we have an application that works with Memcached using spy-memcached (Java) client. Wanted to introduce Hazelcast for this application. At a very early stages of this integration, I want to use Hazelcast using Memcached protocol.

Starting standalone Hazelcast server `./server.sh`. and trying to connect from app.
Getting error from Hazelcast console

```
INFO: [172.17.42.1]:5701 [dev] [3.2.4] Connection [/127.0.0.1:44028] lost. Reason: java.nio.BufferOverflowException[null]
```

Error from spy-memcached

```

```

Apparently, `hazelcast.socket.receive.buffer.size` and `hazelcast.socket.send.buffer.size` properties have nothing to do this this.

Please, advise
