Hi All I am trying to create a Hazelcast cluster with three nodes.
I have created theree map store impimentation for mysql tables.
I load each table at start up using a different hazelcast instance in my cluster.
Just to simulate multi node scenario. 
Each of my table has 100 k records.
But issue happens when i start first node it loads all 100 k keys.
But starting second node loads 49k,  third node only 33k.
