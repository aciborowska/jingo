When a client sends HTTP request without HTTP headers to Hazelcast REST API, the `HttpCommand` class wrongly expects an additional new line:

**Reproducer**
Sample HTTP request which doesn't provide response:
```
GET /hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/version HTTP/1.0<CRLF>
<CRLF>
```

**Workaround 1**
Create a crafted request which adds an extra new line:
```
GET /hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/version HTTP/1.0<CRLF>
<CRLF>
<CRLF>
```

**Workaround 2**
Use HTTP header(s):
```
GET /hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/version HTTP/1.0<CRLF>
Host: 127.0.01<CRLF>
<CRLF>
```
