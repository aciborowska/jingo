We have setup management center on multiple nodes behind a load balancer. Updated hazelcast.xml with the load balanced url. We see the data displayed on Management Center is not consistent. Sometimes all nodes in the cluster are visible, sometime only few are visible and sometimes none. 
After refreshing multiple times we get a message "make sure the management center url is configured to properly".
Does management center support deployment to multiple nodes?
