Hello!

When quorum is not present operations like `MapSizeOperation` produces 2 * 271 (542) log records on every client request. So when quorum is broken log made by `MapSizeOperation` quick fill my disk. 
 
Log file looks like:

This is true for every operation than invokes on all partitions (see [InvokeOnPartitions](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/59276e782f60c123b7ae4e047195372aa5c956d2/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/spi/impl/operationservice/impl/InvokeOnPartitions.java)  )

As a temporary decision I set log level to ERROR for `com.hazelcast.map.impl.operation` package. But I'm afraid I miss some important WARN log record in future.

So my question is this a bug or feature? What should I do?

Version: 3.6.7, but if I understand correctly reasons of this behaviour, there are no changes in 3.8-EA
