Hello Hazelcast team,
While using Hazelcast on Windows I found that start.bat (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/resources/start.bat) script creates CLASSPATH variable with user-lib folder included to the path. So, it looks like:
`"CLASSPATH=%~dp0..\lib\hazelcast-all-3.11.jar;%~dp0..\user-lib;%~dp0..\user-lib\*"`
But in the stop.bat (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/resources/stop.bat) the CLASSPATH value is different:
`CLASSPATH=%~dp0..\lib\hazelcast-all-3.11.jar"`
Because of that, stop.bat fails to terminate Hazelcast instance on Windows and the user has to do it manually. 
As a workaround, I copied CLASSPATH string from start.bat to stop.bat - this solved the issue.
