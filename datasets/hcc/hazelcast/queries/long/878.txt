Hi,

Till hazelcast 3.0.0, the zip is packaged such that after unzipping it will create a folder called "hazelcast-3.0", then creates bin, lib etc inside this.

But hazelcast 3.0.2 package contains bin, lib etc. So it will not create the hazelcast folder instead directly unzips the content into selected location.

Regards,
Santosh
