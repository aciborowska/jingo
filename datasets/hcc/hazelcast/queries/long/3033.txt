In BasicRecordStoreLoader.java an operation is created and executed locally. If retry response is needed for any reason ( partition is migrated etc.) this is not handled by this response handler and set the loaded flag instead of retrying the operation.

``` java
PutAllOperation operation = new PutAllOperation(name, entrySet, true);
operation.setNodeEngine(nodeEngine);
operation.setResponseHandler(new ResponseHandler() {
    @Override
    public void sendResponse(Object obj) {
        if (checkIfMapLoaded.decrementAndGet() == 0) {
            setLoaded(true);
        }
    }

    public boolean isLocal() {
        return true;
    }
});
[....]
nodeEngine.getOperationService().executeOperation(operation);
```

Possible solution : replace response handler with invocation and a callback handler. Invocation will handle retry responses properly.
