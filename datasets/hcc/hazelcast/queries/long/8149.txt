For some reason when I just want to alter an AtomicReference<MyObject> like so:

```
  ref.alter(node -> {
            node.nextNodes[0] = lala;
            node.nextKeys[0] = "lala";
            return node;
        });
```

then nothing changes. A later get will still return the old object. But when i change this to alterAndGet

```
  ref.alterAndGet(node -> {
            node.nextNodes[0] = lala;
            node.nextKeys[0] = "lala";
            return node;
        });
```

then everything works as expected. But in fact I do not want so send the whole object over wire, I just want to modify a property.
