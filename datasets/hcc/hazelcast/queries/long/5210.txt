As per the following email thread. No further details available at this point, I'll try to get more.

It sounds like a bug to me. Because there should not be a null element; either the item should be there or it should not be. It can't be in some intermediate state.

Can you create a github ticket for it?

A co-worker told me about the behaviour he had just observed. Two nodes (v 3.4.2), a ReplicatedMap with a single entry. One of the nodes calls remove(). On the another one, for a short while (seconds), map.keySet() is empty, but map.values() is not empty but has a null element. The replication delay is not changed from the default one.

Is this normal behaviour? Should ReplicatedMaps be always iterated through the keys instead of taking values()?

Thanks a lot,
