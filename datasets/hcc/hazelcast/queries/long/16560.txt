Hi,

Could you please help me to clarify something:
I've noticed that all Sessions that are retrieved from HazelcastSessionRepository are the copies of basic sessions that stored in MapProxyImpl instance. So if I change a proxy session's attribute property:
(This example is not an actual usage, Its just for clarification)
```
List list = hazelcastRepository.getSession("1").getAttribute("List");
list.add(new Object()); //list.size = 1

List list1 = hazelcastRepository.getSession("1").getAttribute("List");
list1.size() // 0
```

The basic session's (in MapProxyImpl) attribute 'List' is not updated as well.

Is there a way to merge original session object inside MapProxyImpl and the proxy (copy) session attributes?

I know, that I could use HazelcastSessionRepository.save() - but it will work when there is delta value (any changes) in parameters map. But in my case the List remain itself in the session.

Thanks!
