Currently it can happen that a HazelcastInstance.getMap blocks due to e.g. maploading, indexing etc. This can be problematic if your rely on that instance to be retrieved quickly. Especially in IOC container like Spring his is very problematic. 

So HazelcastInstance.getMap should never block. Only on first usage, we should do whatever needs to be done.
