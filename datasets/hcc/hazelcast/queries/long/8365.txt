Hi Team,

Server : QueryCollectionsPortableDemo.java
Client : HzClient.java

I have created multiple PortableFactories as I have multiple class definitions. 
[EPPortableFactory - EntryProcessor Portable Factory]
[PersonPortableFactory - Person objects portable factory]

I was trying out various alternatives to query nested collections. But when trying EntryProcessor using,
Map<Integer, Object> r = map.executeOnEntries(new PersonEntryProcessor("left-leg","LL"));

it gives me 0 size result. Even I tried to return all PersonPortable, but still it gives 0 result set

Why I am behind portable?
Well, join operations are not supported by hazelcast. So I am firing join queries on database and creating PersonPortable with nested list<Tuple>

PersonPortable {
 List(Tuple) rows;
}

Tuple {
 name;
value;
}

Thanks & Regards,
Dharam Thacker
