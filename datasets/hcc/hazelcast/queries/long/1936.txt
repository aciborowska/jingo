(Issue based on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hazelcast/dV3equjdt8A, please see more details here)

By loading a Hazelcast config from the classpath, there might be issues trying to load resources from META-INF/services. This is caused by the fact that the provided (or implicit) classloader that is part of the ClasspathXmlConfig is not made available XmlConfigBuilder that does the actual construction of the Config.
