@dbrimley:

When you start a Hazelcast member using the start bash scripts in the /bin directory of the .zip distribution it creates a PID file to be used by the stop.sh

If you subsequently then shutdown the member using the "Shutdown Node" button in the management centre, it does not clean up this PID file.

Next time you come to start via the start.sh it fails as the PID file is still in place.

@emre-aydin:

This problem happens also when you stop using the `cluster.sh` script.

@jgardiner68:

Would the sh trap command do this?

eg:
```

#!/bin/sh

trap cleanup 1 2 3 6

cleanup()
{
  echo "Caught Signal ... cleaning up."
  rm -rf pid_file
  echo "Done cleanup ... quitting."
  exit 1
}
```
