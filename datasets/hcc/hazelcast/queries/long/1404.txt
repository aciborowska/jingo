my getAllKeys() method returns 51 keys, but the loadAll(keys) method isn't run if I don't call the method size() on the IMap.

The following code line doesn't trigger the loadAll(keys) method.
    ValueObject value = instance.getMap.get(key);

The following code line triggers the loadAll(keys) method.
    ValueObject value = instance.getMap.size();

Something wrong?
