
this run is Map only http://54.82.84.143/~jenkins/workspace/stable-xx/3.9-SNAPSHOT/2017_09_09-11_25_38/ttl/

and the GC charts, http://54.82.84.143/~jenkins/workspace/stable-xx/3.9-SNAPSHOT/2017_09_09-11_25_38/ttl/gc.html do not show a leak pattern


this run is Cache put TTL only http://54.82.84.143/~jenkins/workspace/stable-x3/3.9-SNAPSHOT/2017_09_09-12_28_57/ttl/

and we see the leak http://54.82.84.143/~jenkins/workspace/stable-x3/3.9-SNAPSHOT/2017_09_09-12_28_57/ttl/gc.html (edited)


and this run is cache put wait get in caches configed with XML expiry-policy-factory

http://54.82.84.143/~jenkins/workspace/stable-x2/3.9-SNAPSHOT/2017_09_09-12_25_32/ttl/

and gain we see the leak pattern


also  we have a OOME hprof, ziped as http://54.82.84.143/~jenkins/workspace/stable-x2/3.9-SNAPSHOT/2017_09_09-12_25_32/ttl/output/HZ/HzMember2HZ/HzMember2HZ.hprof.zip


I have also added an extra assert,  to the Cache TTL test https://github.com/hazelcast/hzCmd-bench/blob/zeta/src/main/java/hzcmd/cache/PutTtlWaitGetNull.java asserting that the returned value from cache get i null as expected
