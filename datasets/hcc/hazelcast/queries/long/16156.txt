Some configs have implementations and/or their names, when those configs serialised/deserialised from/into xml/yaml file the objects will be changed and won't be "equal".
Having tests only for class names is enough, but config refactoring could possibly lead to subtle bugs like #16047
To find all configs that needs to be changed one has to search for `className` and `typeClassName` in `com.hazelcast.config` and `com.hazelcast.client.config` packages.
