Reliable topic does not guarantee data safety if owner and backup of backed ring buffer goes down at the same time. This is expected and documented. 
But also it can not continue to operate. Currently it stops working with a similar log as below

```
WARNING: hz.client_0 [dev] [3.9.1-SNAPSHOT] Terminating MessageListener WClient$1@6d83d80d on topic: topic. Reason: Unhandled exception, message: sequence:46 is too large. The current tailSequence is:0
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: sequence:46 is too large. The current tailSequence is:0
```

This is tested via client but node would behave the same, because in both proxies we are not handling `IllegalArgumentException`

Basically client side remembers a too high sequence number. Since all data lost in server side, servers start from zero. And when client asks with its sequence number(46 in this case), it gets `IllegalArgumentException`.
