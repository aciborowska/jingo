Under 3.10.5, we are finding that, while our custom `DiscoveryStrategy` implementation is getting created immediately at cluster startup, its `discoverNodes()` method is not getting invoked until `hazelcast.max.join.seconds` has elapsed - 5 minutes by default. This is an unnecessary delay in the join process that to my knowledge is new under `3.10.5` compared to `3.6.3` (the last release we ran against where this worked as expected), and it's not clear that it's a good idea to set that property to a smaller value, as we don't want to run discovery more frequently.

Is this change in behavior intentional? In our case, it isn't acceptable - is there a system property that can be used to ensure `discoverNodes()` is invoked immediately?
