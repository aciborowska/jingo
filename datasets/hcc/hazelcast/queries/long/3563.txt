I was trying to do this,  for some reason,  I liked the look of it....   but 

```
 CacheConfig<Integer, Long> config = new CacheConfig();
 config.setName(basename);
 config.setTypes(Integer.class, Long.class);

 cacheManager.createCache(basename, config);
 ICache<Integer, Long> cache = cacheManager.getCache(basename, config.getKeyType(),     config.getValueType());
```

but i got this 

```
java.lang.ClassCastException: Incompatible cache key types specified, expected class java.lang.Integer but class java.lang.Object was specified
```

this worked as expected.

```
 ICache<Integer, Long> cache = cacheManager.getCache(basename, Integer.class, Long.class);
```
