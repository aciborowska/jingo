If you have a very long SqlQuery with a lot of terms you will get StackOverflowException

```
@Test
public void testLongPredicate() {
    HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
    IMap<String, String> map = hazelcastInstance.getMap(randomString());

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < 4000; i++) {
        sb.append("this == " + i);
        sb.append(" or ");
    }

    sb.append(" this == -1");

    map.entrySet(new SqlPredicate(sb.toString()));
}
```

The reason seems to be that the query is parsed as many nested OrPredicates rather than one OrPredicate with many terms.
