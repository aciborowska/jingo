Hi,

I am trying to trace a weird problem in Hazelcast Management Beans.

In 3.11.4, [ConnectionManagerMBean.getCurrentClientConnections](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/v3.11.4/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/internal/jmx/ConnectionManagerMBean.java#L53) is returning correct value

However,  If I switch to 3.12.2, I expect the same is returned by [NetworkingServiceMBean. getCurrentClientConnections](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/v3.12.2/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/internal/jmx/NetworkingServiceMBean.java#L56) but it is not the case.

This is the output from VisualVM. The value is displayed as `Unavailable`

Apparently, this problem causes a parsing problem in Prometheus jmx_exporter used in Hazelcast Docker Image. Here is the related [issue](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docker/issues/114) raised in hazelcast-docker repository.
