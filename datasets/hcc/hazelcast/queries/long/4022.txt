I'm using hazelcast 2.6.7 and after heavy usage of the cache, the number of misses starts showing up negative. Specifically, it is being reported as the negative of the number of hits (e.g. if hits = 20, misses = -20). I'm getting the map stats as follows:

```
LocalMapStats mapStats = HazelcastCache.instance.getMap("myMap").getLocalMapStats();
long hits = mapStats.getHits();
long misses = mapStats.getMisses();
```
