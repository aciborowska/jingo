I've experimented a critical problem by using just one map with 10 items and 3 nodes. After isolating 1 node, the merge occurs only with some of the keys, not all of them. To be sure, I've also printed the merge calls by using my own merge policy strategy and for some of the keys, the merge is not called.

After the merge is completed (Lifecycle=MERGED), the content of the map of the joined server is different, verified by printing the values after the merge.
