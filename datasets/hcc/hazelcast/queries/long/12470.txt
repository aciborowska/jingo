This seems to be a bug.

ProxyManager won't remove Proxy even after original distributed object destroyed.
This caused memory leak after long time such as 1 month.

The only removing event happens when hazelcast client instance call the getDistributedObjects function.

To avoid memory leak we had to call getDistributedObjects function in distributedObjectDestroyed event in our program.
