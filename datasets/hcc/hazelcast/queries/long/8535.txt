A real memcached instance can fetch more than 150 keys at the same time, hazelcast fails at that because the capacity in the `com.hazelcast.nio.ascii.TextReadHandler` is set too low (currently 500).

If this is raised to e.g. 5000, it's possible to fetch 100 keys with a key length of 32 byte. I wrote a unit test, to reproduce the problem: https://github.com/zalora/hazelcast/commit/1c2d4fe14930782d33647cffdd2a0f575b36022c

Is it ok, if I raise the buffer size to 5000 and create a pull request for it? I already signed the contributor agreement form: https://hazelcast.atlassian.net/wiki/display/COM/Hazelcast+Contributor+Agreement
