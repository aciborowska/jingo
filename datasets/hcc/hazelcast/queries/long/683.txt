Hazelcast 3.0

If the instance name contains special characters as in "[:\",=*?]", then HazelcastMBean is registered successfully by quoting them, see com.hazelcast.jmx.HazelcastMBean.createObjectName(), but on shutdown, the MBean is tried to get unregistered without this quoting in com.hazelcast.jmx.ManagementService.destroy(), which then fails with the error below.

Error while un-registering MBeans: javax.management.MalformedObjectNameException: Invalid character ':' in value part of property
