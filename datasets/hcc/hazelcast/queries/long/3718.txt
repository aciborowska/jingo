"I have 2 Hazelcast nodes on 2 different physical box forming a cluster connecting to a ManagementConsole. What I do is, hit "Shutdown" a node using Management Console, the node I selected for shutdown gets a shutdown signal and gets terminated; when I hit shutdown button, I hit the button multiple times. Now after both the nodes are terminated I start them again, here's whats happening, they do come up but they start the shutdown process immediately and this is because the Management Console had queued those Shutdown commands and now as the nodes join in, they release those command causing nodes to shutdown."
