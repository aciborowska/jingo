Using Hazelcast out of the box with no configuration creates a p2p cluster. As soon as I create a hazelcast.xml in which I only set the logging type, Hazelcast won't create a cluster but start in standalone mode.

I didn't write any network configuration in the config file so I expect the Hazelcast default behavoir.
