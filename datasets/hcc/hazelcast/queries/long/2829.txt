In 2.x, the heartbeat in com.hazelcast.client.ConnectionManager creates new threads for each execution of the heartbeat.  This leads to a memory leak on the server as new CallContext objects are created for each client thread.

Here is the simplified code that creates new threads for each heartbeat execution:

```
   void scheduleHeartbeatTimerTask() {
          final int TIMEOUT = config.getConnectionTimeout();
          heartbeatTimer.schedule(new TimerTask() {
                 @Override
                 public void run() {
                       //runs repeatedly
                       new Thread(new Runnable() {
                              public void run() {
                                     Set<Member> members = client.getCluster().getMembers();
                              }
                       }).start();
                 }
          }, TIMEOUT / 10, TIMEOUT / 10);
   }
```
