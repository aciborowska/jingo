Hi,

When serverA is down, serverB can't take over its job. I can see 2 users in different sessions, but it seems hazelcast can't replicate the session, so serverB as backup can't use it. 

Invalid SID found in Chrome. Session can't be replicated? When one server is down, SID is lost.

<h2>HTTP ERROR: 404</h2>

<p>Problem accessing /http-bind/. Reason:
<pre> Invalid SID.</pre></p>

PS:I'm using Openfire 3.8.1, hazelcast2.5 as plugin & haproxy to implement clustering.
