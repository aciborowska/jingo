To reproduce the problem is enough to start few Hazlecast instances that do nothing, one instance of HazlecastClient that just register a ReliableMessageListener on a reliable topic, and after to shutdown randomly some of the cluster members. It seems that is more easy to reproduce the problem if the cluster members are closed in reverse opening order.

```
  public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
  }

```

```
  public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    HazelcastInstance hz = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient();

    ITopic<Long> topic = hz.getReliableTopic("sometopic");
    topic.addMessageListener(new MessageListenerImpl());
  }

  private static class MessageListenerImpl implements ReliableMessageListener<Long> {
    public void onMessage(Message<Long> m) {
    }
    public boolean isLossTolerant() {
      return false;
    }
    public boolean isTerminal(Throwable arg0) {
      return false;
    }
    public long retrieveInitialSequence() {
      return 0;
    }
    public void storeSequence(long arg0) {
    }
  }
```

```

Enabling redo operations on the client,

```
  public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

it doesn't help too much. It just makes the problem more difficult to reproduce.

Notes: 
- Test environment: Hazelcast 3.6; Java 1.8.0_45; Windows 10;
- The problem can be reproduced also when all cluster members are publishing messages on the reliable topic and client consumes them;
- The problem can be reproduced also with Hazelcast 3.6.2;
