When I call `getInstances` on `HazelcastInstance` (aquired via `HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig)`), I get collection with them. After some time I call the same method and get an exception:

```
java.lang.NullPointerException

java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.hash(ConcurrentHashMap.java:333),
java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.get(ConcurrentHashMap.java:988), 
com.hazelcast.client.HazelcastClient.getClientProxy(HazelcastClient.java:167), 
com.hazelcast.client.ClusterClientProxy.getInstances(ClusterClientProxy.java:47), 
com.hazelcast.client.HazelcastClient.getInstances(HazelcastClient.java:260)
...some my groovy code...
```

This behaviour is not deterministic - there seems to be no reason to appear - doesn't appear after load, after exact time etc. When I get the NPE for the first time, I get it all the next calls until I restart the cluster.
This cluster usually has about 4 members, 2 clients and no lite members.

Environment:
Groovy version: 1.8.8
JVM version: 1.7.0_19
Hazelcast version: 2.5.1
