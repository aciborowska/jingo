When ManCenter is enabled, `TimedMemberStateFactory.createMemState` method get stats from Members. `LocalMapStatsProvider.createAllLocalMapStats` method calls `partitionService.getPartition` method without the `triggerOwnerAssignment` boolean flag. In a big cluster with no initial data, this causes partition migration for each joining member & increase cluster startup time significantly.

There may be other sources that causes this, like Diagnostics etc. It'd be good to check all of them if possible.

This is currently affecting a customer with > 100 member cluster.
