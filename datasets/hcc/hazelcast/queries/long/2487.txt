I have been working on reproducing an issue and playing with settings. I have a 3 node cluster (3 different EC2 machines), and map listeners and a configurable delay in the map listener. If I set the delay to e.g. 1 second I run into OperationTimeoutException. This is with Hazelcast 3.2.1, ubuntu 12.04, Oracle Java 1.7.0_55. The Stabilizer test that reproduces this issue, can be found here

It takes +/- 10 minutes to get the exception.

[edit]
With Hazelcast 3.3-SNAPSHOT the issue is still happening. For this particular run I didn't get an exception btw, but the worker JVM's stopped responding because of OOME. I'm now downloading the heapdump to figure out what is accumulating.
