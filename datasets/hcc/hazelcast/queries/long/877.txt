Hazelcast 3.0.1
http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring/hazelcast-spring-3.1.xsd

The destroyMethodName in com.hazelcast.spring.HazelcastInstanceDefinitionParser (line 44) should be "shutdownAll" instead of "shutdown" (does not exist in HazelcastInstanceFactory).  The "Bean Init and Destroy Method Rule" of Spring bean validators in Eclipse/STS marks the Spring configuration file as invalid by showing the following error:

Destroy-method 'shutdown' not found in bean class 'com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance'

Thank you!
