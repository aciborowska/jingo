When using XML to configure a Queue to use a QueueStoreFactory I get a null pointer at QueueStoreWrapper on line:95:

```
            QueueStoreFactory factory = storeConfig.getFactoryImplementation();
```

The reason for this is that:

`setConfig(QueueStoreConfig storeConfig, String name)` calls `factoryImpl(name);` before setting `this.storeConfig`

This means that `storeConfig` will always be null when  `factoryImpl(name)` is running.

Version of Hazelcast I'm using is 3.3
