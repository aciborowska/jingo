hazelcast 3.8.4

The javadoc for MapEvictionPolicy.compare says:
> If you prefer to evict the 1st entry then return positive number, if the 2nd entry is a better candidate then return a negative number or return 0 if both entries are equally good candidates for eviction

which seems to be incorrect as the implementations (LRUEvictionPolicy and LFUEvictionPolicy) behave the opposite way i.e. return -1 if the first entry needs to be evicted and +1 if the second.
