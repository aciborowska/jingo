__Issue:__
[Here](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/map/impl/nearcache/MapNearCacheManager.java#L137), we are creating invalidation sequences even there is no near cache. We should also provide a path to remove them.
Regression was introduced with [this PR](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/10442/files#diff-8260efbe8178f8531e636813e7282500R138)

```
public static void main(String [] args) {
        HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        for (int i = 0; i < 100_000_000; i++) {
            IMap<Object, Object> map = hz.getMap(String.valueOf(i));
            map.put("key", " value");
            map.destroy();
            if (i % 1000 == 0) {
                System.out.println(i);
            }
        }
    }
