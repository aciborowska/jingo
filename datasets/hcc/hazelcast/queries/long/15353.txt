hazelcast 3.12.1
Java 11

steps: 
1) Create a cluster with 2 members (lets call them A and B) on separate servers
2) Add a MembershipListener on each side. 
3) Simulate a network split, (eg. with iptables) and restore the connections. 

When the clusters merge again `memberAdded(MembershipEvent event)` is called on both sides, but `event.getmembers()` contains `[A,B]` on server A and `[B,A]` on server B.
