I have two apps deployed on different VM's. First app connects to another as Hazelcast Client. 
As soon second app goes down, client starts reconnection as expeced. Finally the client says 

> "Could not re-connect to cluster shutting down the client"

and goes to `ClusterListenerSupport:233` to shutdown LifecycleService. 

After some components shutdowns, called `ClusterListenerSupport.shutdown`
And the component tries to shutdown clusterExecutor and stucked for `TERMINATE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` because the task is launched inside this clusterExecutor. 

Here is screen from debug view

Log says:

> 13:34:41,955 INFO  [com.hazelcast.core.LifecycleService](hz.client_50_ustaxi-shift.cluster-1) HazelcastClient[hz.client_50_ustaxi-shift][3.6.2] is SHUTTING_DOWN

This issue reproduces permanently and only after target instance goes down.
