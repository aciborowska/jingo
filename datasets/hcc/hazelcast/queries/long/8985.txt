I'm loading database data into `IMap<string,` MemberDetails>`in my Java project. Here the MemberDetails contains List of MemberDetail. Where MemberDetail contains 3 column's setter/getter. Both MemberDetails & MemberDetail are POJO classes and implements Serializable interface in Java. 
   I'm trying to get the`IMap<string, MemberDetails>` from .Net webservice using HazelCast .Net client dll. I'm able to contact Hazelcast member which is running Java Environment and get the IMap object from .Net. But when i try to retrieve data from the IMap (which i got from .net client) it throws HazelcastSerializationException saying that "There is no suitable deserialization method found for this type -100" from .Net client. 
Please help me on this issue to resolve. Do i need to use any Serializable interface from Hazelcast? Or is there any Deserialization method to be implemented in .Net Client? Thanks in advance.
