Hazelcast running on RHEL (OpenJDK8) shows "unknown gc" in the logs (instead of "major" and "minor" gc). Looks like RHEL OpenJDK GC is not supported in Hazelcast.

```
minor.gc.count=0, minor.gc.time=0ms, major.gc.count=0, major.gc.time=0ms, unknown.gc.count=224, unknown.gc.time=421ms
```

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create EC2 Instance from AMI (https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-central-1#Images:search=ami-081df3d85a2ec2965)
2. SSH to the instance
3. Start Management Center: "cd ./management-center/hazelcast-management-center-3.11.3 && ./start.sh"
4. Start Hazelcast: "cd hazelcast-enterprise/ && ./start.sh"
5. In the Management Center, you'll see that GC is not shown (so unknown GC is used)
