I started two different instances. Configuration was loaded programmatically:

hazelcast.network.multicast=true
hazelcast.network.tcpip=true
hazelcast.network.tcpip.members=localhost:5701,localhost:5702
hazelcast.port=5701

According to the generated thread dumps Hazelcast was trying to complete the Node.join operation, but it kept recursively going from a MulticastJoiner to a TcpIpJoiner and never actually completing the operation. As time went by the stack kept growing. My instances were frozen for over 30minutes until I killed one of them, and the other one was able to complete the join.
