`WanConsumer` is not getting initialized in OS version, only in EE version. This needs to get fixed. 

Also, the documentation around `WanConsumer` and building an OS WAN replication implementation should be improved. A concrete point is that `WanConsumer`s are expected to implement `HazelcastInstanceAware` to get a reference through which they can put the data into a cluster.

The fix should be done both for 4.0.1 and 4.1.
