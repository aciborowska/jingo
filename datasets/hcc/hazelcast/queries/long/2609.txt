Good afternoon. 

I'm sorry to trouble you, if my report is irrelevant. 

In our production environment for a long time used Hazel—Åast v3.1.3. Yesterday it was decided to upgrade to version 3.2.2. And that's what happened: 

1 From time to time problems began to arise when retrieving data from the Hazelcast's map. Thus there is such error:

com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.HazelcastSerializationException: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        at com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.SerializationServiceImpl.handleException(SerializationServiceImpl.java:298)
        at com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.SerializationServiceImpl.toObject(SerializationServiceImpl.java:227)
        at com.hazelcast.client.spi.ClientProxy.invoke(ClientProxy.java:112)
        at com.hazelcast.client.proxy.ClientMapProxy.get(ClientMapProxy.java:151)

Sometimes there is such error:

com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.HazelcastSerializationException: java.io.UTFDataFormatException: malformed input around byte 15443
        at com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.SerializationServiceImpl.handleException(SerializationServiceImpl.java:298)
        at com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.SerializationServiceImpl.toObject(SerializationServiceImpl.java:227)
        at com.hazelcast.client.spi.ClientProxy.invoke(ClientProxy.java:112)
        at com.hazelcast.client.proxy.ClientMapProxy.get(ClientMapProxy.java:151)

2 In permanent storage (Apache Cassandra) began to appear broken data. Data recorded into Cassandra periodically from Hazelcast. Feeling that there is some distortion while reading data from Hazelcast.

Thus :
- Most of the data is deserialized correctly;
- Part of the data is deserialized with distortion (maybe);
- Part of the data can not be deserialized.

We use JSON-strings. All client services have been recompiled with libraries version 3.2.2.

Last night had to roll back to version 3.1.3 - errors disappeared.

I do not know, it's important or not, but on server with Hazelcast (before return to 3.1.3) was the wrong time - under the current time is 12 hours.

Thanks for your time and help.
