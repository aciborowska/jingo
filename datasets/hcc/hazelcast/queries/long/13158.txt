When adding a dynamic data structure configuration then we fail-fast when the same structure is already configured statically. even when both configs are equal.
The expected outcome would be to silently ignore the submitted dynamic config when it is equal to an existing static config, or fail with a `ConfigurationException` when a conflicting static config already exists. The same behavior (ignore when equal, fail on conflict) is already in place when checking a submitted config against existing dynamic configs.

Kudos @jerrinot for raising this issue
