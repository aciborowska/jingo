Hello,
I am currently testing what is happening when you kill the last remaining hazelcast server while being connected and reading with a native client.

When the server is going down, the client hangs. To know what is happening, I changed the logging settings and discovered what was happening:

The client is correctly notified by those messages:

```
59754 [hz.client_0_dev.cluster-listener] WARN  com.hazelcast.client.spi.ClientClusterService  - Error while listening cluster events! -> Connection [Address[192.168.56.100]:5701 -> /127.0.0.1:43540]

java.io.EOFException

59985 [hz.client_0_dev.cached-13] FATAL com.hazelcast.client.connection.HeartBeatChecker  - Error during heartbeat check!

java.io.EOFException

```

Then, other messages show up:

```
60772 [hz.client_0_dev.cluster-listener] DEBUG com.hazelcast.client.spi.ClientClusterService  - IO error during initial connection...

java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
60789 [hz.client_0_dev.cluster-listener] WARN  com.hazelcast.client.spi.ClientClusterService  - Unable to get alive cluster connection, try in 2992 ms later, attempt 1 of 2.

60832 [hz.client_0_dev.cached-14] WARN  com.hazelcast.client.connection.ClientConnectionManager  - Error during connection creation... To -> Address[192.168.56.100]:5701

66791 [hz.client_0_dev.cluster-listener] INFO  com.hazelcast.core.LifecycleService  - HazelcastClient[hz.client_0_dev] is SHUTDOWN
```

After that, Hazelcast seems to be entering a kind of infinite loop while printing those messages:

```
66797 [hz.client_0_dev.cached-14] DEBUG com.hazelcast.client.spi.ClientClusterService  - Retrying com.hazelcast.partition.client.GetPartitionsRequest@5ad4fbfd, last-conn: null, last-error: com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstanceNotActiveException: Hazelcast instance is not active!

```

If you want some other informations, feel free to ask.

Regards
