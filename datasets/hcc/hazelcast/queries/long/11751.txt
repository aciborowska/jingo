The method `ProxyManager.getOrCreateProxy()` creates a `ClientProxy` even if it's not used - i.e. when it already have a `ClientProxyFuture` instance in the `proxies` Map:

```java
final ClientProxy clientProxy = createClientProxy(id, factory);
proxyFuture = new ClientProxyFuture();
final ClientProxyFuture current = proxies.putIfAbsent(ns, proxyFuture);
if (current != null) {
    return current.get();
}
```
