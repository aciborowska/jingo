  With Java clients (3.12. and 4.x ), it looks like I cannot specify a class override for client load balancer. https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12.4/manual/html-single/#configuring-client-load-balancer
This could be a documentation error, or documentation is right, but the XSD schema is wrong.
```
<hazelcast-client>
    ...
    <load-balancer type="random">
        yourLoadBalancer
    </load-balancer>
    ...
</hazelcast-client>
```
is not allowed by the schema. And if it was allowed, a third “type” keyword should be added in order not to generate confusion, for example “custom” ? Programmatic works fine.
