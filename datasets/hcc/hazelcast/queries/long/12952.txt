
from this run https://hazelcast-l337.ci.cloudbees.com/view/shutdown/job/shutdown-All/60/console
of `shutdown` test, on 3.10

we had multi fails, of the same style.
In the 3 entry processor test failures, each time we see the count on the entry is 1 more that expected, which I think means the entry processore call throw and exception to indicate an error
when the processor was really executed.  In a stable cluster these test pass as expected.
