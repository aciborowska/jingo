We have exposed the caches via JMX and we have defined a reloadCache functionality where in we first do a evictAll and then call loadAll(true). However it doesn't get keys and the cache is empty. 

We often require reloadCache functionality in production in case of issues and this has been causing issues for a while after we migrated from 3.4 to 3.7

Expecting a reply

Thanks
