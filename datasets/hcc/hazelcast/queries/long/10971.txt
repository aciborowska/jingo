If you try to connect to a Hazelcast Cluster that has SSL/Security disabled with a Hazelcast Client that has SSL enabled we seem to get a very strange error message...where it complains that "Memcached not enabled".  

This is using 3.8.1 both sides.  Not tried 3.8.3/3.9-EA

Can we please change this to tell the user they're trying to connect with an SSL enabled client to a non SSL cluster
