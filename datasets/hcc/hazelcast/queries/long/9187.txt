scheduler in TcpIpConnectionManager not finished after instance.shutdown() called
private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(4);

which causes problem in our spring boot environment - those threads run indefinitely and our aplication is not finished

how to reproduce with sample app:
1) run 4 instances java -jar hazelcast-test-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
2) every member is in clusetr
3) 1st instace - watch threads in jvisualvm
4) 2nd-4th kill them - (-9, no ctrl+c)
5) start another 3 instances

repeat 4) and 5) until pool-2-thread-1, pool-2-thread-2, pool-2-thread-3 and pool-2-thread-4 are created

now hit ctrl + c in console of 1st instace, all threads are finished except pool-2-thread-1, pool-2-thread-2, pool-2-thread-3 and pool-2-thread-4
they are eventually finised too, but only in this simplified example (after 60 seconds)
