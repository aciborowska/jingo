There is added new field to `CacheCreateConfigOperation` as `ignoreLocal` for ignoring cache config creation on node that receives operation. It was more likely about optimization and configurable operation. But when deserializing operation, it causes error since previous servers were using only one boolean field as `create` but newer servers are using two boolean field as `createAlsoOnOtherNodes` and  `ignoreLocal`.
