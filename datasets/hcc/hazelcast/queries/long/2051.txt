In case of running our code on a virtual machine, we are getting following exception:

<b>com.hazelcast.core.OperationTimeoutException:</b> No response for 10000 ms. 

In production it could take several hours until occurrence. So we are using .setProperty(PROP_OPERATION_CALL_TIMEOUT_MILLIS, '5000') 
to speed up this problem. The main issue is the fact that hazelcast keeps throwing exception and stays inresponsive. 

We put together some example code: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mgrossmann/9620178"> gist </a>

<i>If we run this code on two dedicated (virtual) machines, 
it lasts up to 10 minutes until the error occurres.</i>
