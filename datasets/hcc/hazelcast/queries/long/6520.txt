Hi,
We're using Hazelcast 3.2.6 in a cluster environment - 3 machines. Although we don't have a repro case, we've seen Hazelcast locks stuck - i.e., no thread appear to be holding the lock, but there are other threads who are blocked trying to take the locks.

We've even seen a thread blocked on tryLock(), which should never happen. Here's the stack trace:

```

```

Was any bug fixed in Hazelcast post 3.2.6 that may explain this issue?

Thank you in advance.
