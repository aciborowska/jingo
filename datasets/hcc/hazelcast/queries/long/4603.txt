Both of the ClientConditionProxy and ConditionImpl classes implement the Condition interface, however they incorrectly return the elapsed time, instead of the remaining time (which is one of the primary purposes of that method).

For example:

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/concurrent/lock/ConditionImpl.java#L69-74

```
    public long awaitNanos(long nanosTimeout) throws InterruptedException {
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        await(nanosTimeout, TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS);
        long end = System.nanoTime();
        return (end - start);
    }
```
