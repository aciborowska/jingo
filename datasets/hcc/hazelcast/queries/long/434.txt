I'm replacing an object in a map inside a trasaction and then I query the map using IMap.values(Predicate) but the resulting values are not reflecting the last entry I've updated. If I commit the transaction first, then I see the correct results but I guess that the value(Predicate) method should be aware of the changes before committing like the values() method does.
