Currently, merge policy cannot be defined for replicated maps with xml configuration as `merge-policy` is missing in `hazelcast-config.xsd` for `replicatedmap`, and the same is true for xml based Spring configuration. The fix needs to be done in the following files: 
- `hazelcast-config-3.10.xsd`
- `hazelcast-spring-3.10.xsd`
- `ConfigXmlGenerator.java`
- `hazelcast-fullconfig.xml`
- `fullConfig-applicationContext-hazelcast.xml`
- `ConfigXmlGeneratorTest.java`
