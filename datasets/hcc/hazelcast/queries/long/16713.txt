**Describe the bug**
Hello,
I want to write entries to a queue using REST call. This is no problem, this works fine.
Next step is to create a item listener on this queue using the NodeJs client. This item listener should poll the entries which I added by the REST call. If I try to start the NodeJs client, there will be an error: 

RangeError: There is no Identified Data Serializer factory with id -37.

I read a lot of your documentation and tried to create a custom serializer, identified data serializer. Nothing works. I dont know what to do next.

**Expected behavior**
I expect the NodeJs Client to receive the JSON string that was written to the queue via the REST call.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Curl 
```
 curl -v -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '{"name":"example"}' http://<host>/hazelcast/rest/queues/myqueue
```
2. NodeJs Files
index.ts
```
import { HazelcastClient } from './hazelcast';

const client = new HazelcastClient();
client.startClient().then(client => {
    client.getQueue('myqueue').then(queue => {
        const itemListener = {
            itemAdded: (itemEvent) => {
                console.log('item added', itemEvent.item);
            } ,
            itemRemoved: (itemEvent) => {
                console.log('item removed', itemEvent.item);
            }
        };
        queue.addItemListener(itemListener, true).then(value => {
            console.log(value);
        });
    });
}); 
```
hazelcast.ts
```
import { Client, Config } from 'hazelcast-client';
export class HazelcastClient {
    config = new Config.ClientConfig();

    constructor() {
        this.config.networkConfig.addresses.push(
               'myaddresses:5701
        );
    }

    startClient() {
        return Client.newHazelcastClient(this.config);
    }
}
```
3. Error Message: 
```
RangeError: There is no Identified Data Serializer factory with id -37.
```

Common details that we're often interested in:
- Detailed description of the steps to reproduce your issue
- Logs and stack traces, if available
- Hazelcast version that you use (e.g. 3.4, also specify whether it is a minor release or the latest snapshot)
- If available, integration module versions (e.g. Tomcat, Jetty, Spring, Hibernate). Also, include their detailed configuration information such as web.xml, Hibernate configuration and `context.xml` for Spring
- Cluster size, i.e. the number of Hazelcast cluster members
- Number of the clients
- Version of Java. It is also helpful to mention the JVM parameters
- Operating system. If it is Linux, kernel version is helpful
- Unit test with the `hazelcast.xml` file. If you could include a unit test which reproduces your issue, we would be grateful
