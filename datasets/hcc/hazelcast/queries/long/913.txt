We are running two Hazelcast nodes in production.
When a switchover is done between 2 nodes and migration ensues, everything works OK

but

we have noticed that eviction based on IMap#put() with explicit TTL values is affected by this switchover and follow-up date migration.

Eviction normally happens after 20 minutes, but we've seen random times like 5 minutes and 10 minutes.

After all entries in the map are gone, TTL behaviour is back to normal.

Please let us know whether this is a known issue, or we should proceed and provide you code and description, how to reproduce this.

Kind regards,
Timur
