**Issue**

As discussed 2017-08-29 with Al

We are losing notification from a hazelcast node through ITopic listeners (MessageListener<E>). Infrequently (but often enough to be a concern) we lose all notifications for new messages posted to an ITopic that are stored on one node in a cluster. Other nodes in the cluster seem to continue to work normally and the client continues to receive new messages from those nodes. This happens with no exceptions/errors seen at the client side.

This is not an issue with ReliableTopics and associated listeners.

**Replication**

We can replicate this issue as follows:

1. Run a cluster of 2 nodes and one client application subscribed to the ITopics.
2. Post messages (increasing integers) in an ITopic
3. Repeatedly shut down and restart one node until we see the client logging messages with obvious gaps.
