Currently there is no control on the number of unprocessed messages. So if a system can produce messages faster than it can consume, it  leads to OOME.

Therefor we need to control the number of unprocessed messages. We could give the ITopic a max capacity setting. 

There are a few things we can do for sending, for example we could block.. thrown an exception etc. Another option would be to add some kind of handler where a user can specify what needs to be done. Blocking, exception etc could be provided as out of the box handlers.
