A customer is reporting that if exchanging data between .NET and Java, the PortableFactories for each must define the fields in the same order particularly for the key. If they are not the key appears not to exist in the other language. 

The solution is to define the fields in the same order in each. Is that a bug? If not it should be clearly documented.
