When Reliable Topic operations are performed from Java client, the Reliable Topic statistics are not updated. The following test fails:

```
@Test
public void publishSingle(){
    String name = "testTopic";
    ITopic topic = client.getReliableTopic(name);

    final String msg = "foobar";
    topic.publish(msg);

    assertEquals(1, hazelcastInstance.getReliableTopic(name)
            .getLocalTopicStats().getPublishOperationCount());
}
```
