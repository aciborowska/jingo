Currently I am using hz#3.8.3, and topology in my env is:

2 nodes-cluster(provides configurations of my application), so this guy are connected by 13 connections.

12 nodes-cluster(my application workers) these "12 nodes" creates connects to (2 nodes-cluster) to get configurations

1 client(ui) talk to (2 nodes-cluster and 12 nodes-cluster) with connections

The problem:
```
# 2017-09-21 06:50:43 [WARN ] [ClientListenerService:66] - hz.client_0 [dev] [3.8.3]  event clientMessage could not be handled
java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException: Task: com.hazelcast.client.spi.impl.listener.ClientListenerServiceImpl$ClientEventProcessor@77555276 is rejected, the worker queue is full!
```

After running 1~2 days I got the error above and I can't reconnect the (2 nodes-cluster) without restart that cluster.

Does someone can help me to figure out what happened to my application?
