Java client is doing `hazelcast.shutdown()`

On 3.11 this appears server side as:
```

```

On 3.10.6, 
```
2018-12-07 10:28:08.177  INFO 17811 --- [.IO.thread-in-0] com.hazelcast.nio.tcp.TcpIpConnection    : [127.0.0.1]:5701 [xxx] [3.10.6] Connection[id=1, /127.0.0.1:5701->localhost/127.0.0.1:57724, endpoint=[127.0.0.1]:57724, alive=false, type=JAVA_CLIENT] closed. Reason: Connection closed by the other side
```

The 3.11 behaviour is confusing, there's no error if the client has run `shutdown()` so an exception should not appear server side.
