A number of packages (`*.impl`, `*.internal`, etc.) are excluded from Javadoc generation in the Maven `release-snapshot` profile. However, no packages at all are excluded in the `release` profile. As a result, the released Javadocs contain classes from all packages. 

I think the `release` profile should exclude the same set of packages as `release-snapshot`. Applies both to OSS and EE.
