Client transaction requests are executed as blocking operations on server side by using transactional proxies directly, which can block all the generic/client thread pool at some point. 

Instead they should use non-blocking/async approach and return response when resource available. 

See `AbstractTxnMapRequest` and `BaseTransactionRequest` for instance...
