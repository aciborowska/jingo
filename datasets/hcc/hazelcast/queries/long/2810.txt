MapProxySupport class has a reference field  of MapConfig which never change. 

After UpdateMapConfigOperation executed MapContainer's mapConfig updates but this doesn't reflected to map proxy reference stated above.

possible solution is "replace mapConfig  reference with a method call which returns the mapconfig from mapContainer"
