If a connection is not 'clientside' connection, then the AbstractChannel.onConnect isn't called. And in the onConnect the registration is done

```
   @Override
    protected void onConnect() {
        String metricsId = localSocketAddress() + "->" + remoteSocketAddress();
        metricsRegistry.scanAndRegister(outboundPipeline, "tcp.connection[" + metricsId + "].out");
        metricsRegistry.scanAndRegister(inboundPipeline, "tcp.connection[" + metricsId + "].in");
    }
```

This should be moved to the 'start' method since start is always called.
