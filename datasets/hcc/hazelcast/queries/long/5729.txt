com.hazelcast.internal.monitors.PerformanceLogFile was recently added (7/15). It makes use of InetSocketAddress.getHostString() which is only public in JDK 1.7 and above.

When compiling using JDK 1.6 (per Maven property jdk.version), this raises an error.

```
    /**
     * Returns the hostname, or the String form of the address if it
     * doesn't have a hostname (it was created using a literal).
     * This has the benefit of <b>not</b> attempting a reverse lookup.
     *
     * @return the hostname, or String representation of the address.
     * @since 1.7
     */
    public final String getHostString() {
        return holder.getHostString();
    }
```

```
    private String getPathName() {
        Member localMember = hazelcastInstance.getCluster().getLocalMember();
        InetSocketAddress address = localMember.getSocketAddress();
        String addressString = address.getHostString().replace(":", "_") + "#" + address.getPort();
        return "performance-" + addressString + "-" + currentTimeMillis() + "-%03d.log";
    }

```

Please note that building using maven and JDK 1.7 does not generate the compilation error, only when the JDK 1.6 is used.
