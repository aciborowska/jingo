When an exception is thrown from an `InitializingObject`'s `initialize` method, [it is logged in `WARNING` level but then swallowed and the proxy object is added to the `ProxyRegistry`](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/85a47e3f9c28599342a510a439ed83e5e14f66d0/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/spi/impl/proxyservice/impl/ProxyRegistry.java#L173-L189). Instead, the exception should result in removing the object from the `ProxyRegistry`, as already done for exceptions thrown from `service.createDistributedObject`.
