Currently if the object stored in a Map has a `java.util.Date` field assigned with a `java.sql.Timestmap` instance and the type specified in a predicate is of java.util.Date type, the query will fail, since the convereter initialised in the `Predicate` will be `SqlTimestampConverter` and it does not handle the `java.util.Date` type.

`java.Sql.Timestamp` extends `java.util.Date` so adding the following section to the `SqlTimestampConverter` would be beneficial:

```
            if (value instanceof java.sql.Date) {
                return value;
            }
```

It's a regression - it's confirmed that it used to work in 3.4.6
