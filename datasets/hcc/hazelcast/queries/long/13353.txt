
I just found this logging line in the client logs

```
Jun 21, 2018 7:48:37 PM com.hazelcast.client.cache.impl.nearcache.invalidation.ClientCacheMetaDataFetcher
WARNING: hz.client_0 [HZ] [3.10.2] Can't fetch invalidation meta-data [NullPointerException] null
```

I had 4 client's in the test, and only 1 client, 1 time logged this line.


the test was doing create use destroy operations from all members and client for all types of structs, including maps / cache which have a near cache defined on the client side.


stable/destroy/create-use-destroy
```
cat  ./stable/destroy/create-use-destroy/output/HZ/HzClient2HZ/out.txt | grep -A10 -B10 Null
```

unfortunately the stack trace is swallowed
