Executing a query on an indexed Enum type atrribute returns no results.

Support was added to execute queries on enum types in [JIRA-790](http://code.google.com/p/hazelcast/issues/detail?id=790).

But if the enum attribute the query is executed on has an index, no results are ever found matching it..

With the following configuration for the map:

`
<hz:map name="mainEvents" max-size="10000" time-to-live-seconds="12000">
    <hz:indexes>
    <!--    <hz:index attribute="eventType" ordered="false" /> -->
    </hz:indexes>
</hz:map> 
`

And the following code executing the query:

`
IMap<Integer, MBEvent> map = cacheService.getMap("mainEvents");
Set<MBEvent> events = (Set<MBEvent>) map.values(new SqlPredicate("eventType=LIVE"));
`

Uncommenting the index makes the events Set to be empty after the execution.
