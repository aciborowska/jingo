We are using the management center version 3.3.2. We've created a custom login and removed the default admin user:

However, after logging out, I can still login with the user _admin_ and password _admin_. And the admin user is then again visible on the _Administration_ tab, where I can delete it, but afterwards log in with it again.

Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but that's not the behavior I was expecting. I took a quick peek into _/usr/share/tomcat7/mancenter3.3/_, but I'm not sure how to properly view or edit either _user.db_ or _user.lg_. Am I missing a configuration setting or is this a bug?
