I have a map with in-memory format Object. I am using Entry Processor to make sure that I have no serialization or deserialization going on. However it turns out that there are couple of places where Hazelcast actually serialized or deserialized. One of the places where we do is afterRun() method of EntryOperation and in the same class in run() method when we store it in ObjectRecordFactory.
