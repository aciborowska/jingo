we have an hazelcast 5 members cluster (hazelcast 2.4), and we had the following accident:
- hz node A notified that node B was unreachable (even if the node was phisically up and running).
- after this issue node B raised some OperationTimeoutException on "get"
- later, node A raised some OperationTimeoutException on "put"

com.hazelcast.core.OperationTimeoutException: [EXECUTE] Redo threshold[90] exceeded! Last redo cause: REDO_MEMBER_UNKNOWN, Name: x:hz.batch

To solve the problem we reboot node A and B.

We are  not able to understand the root cause of this issue. Any Idea?
