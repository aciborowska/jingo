When a `MetadataAwareValue` is loaded (for instance in `DefaultRecordStore.loadRecordOrNull()`) exactly (in millis) at its expiration time, the entry will be marked as non-expirable. This is because we convert the expiration time to TTL (expiration time - current time) and if the TTL is 0, we treat the record as non-expirable.

See https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15677 for an instance where this contributed to test failures.
