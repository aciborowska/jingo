This is my config
<map name="indiciescache">
        <max-size>8</max-size>
        <eviction-policy>LFU</eviction-policy>
    </map>

While I understand you CANNOT set the max-size below the partition count which is 271 by default Hazel should handle this and if max-size is lower then partition-count THEN set it to the partition count.  

What happens is nothing ever makes it into the map. This is confusing behavior.  The config is not rejected meaning no errors on startup.  Everything looks like it works but it is not.
