- Hazelcast version: 3.6
- Cluster size: 2
- Java version: 7

We have 2 members using a shared map (tested with backup count >= 2).
Both members put entries in the map.
Then one member is killed and we detect lost map entries on the alive member (possibly some entries put by the alive member itself).
Can this scenario be fixed by https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5444 ?
