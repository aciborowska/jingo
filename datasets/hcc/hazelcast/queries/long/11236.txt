If the client times out, it tells us the time that is remaining. That isn't particularly useful; it should tell is how much time was spend. Probably best to get inspired by the exception message on the server that is a lot more informative.      

```
 clientInvocationFuture.complete(new OperationTimeoutException(this + " timed out by "
                    + Math.abs(remainingMillis) + " ms"));
 ```   

Also 'timed out by a .. ms' doesn't explain the intent.. it doesn't explain if it is remaining or how much time was spend.
