There's a code:
 if (!evictable) {
                    return;
                }
evictMap(mapContainer);

which makes eviction process stops completely. Return/continue statement should not be used since they are fragile to refactoring. Instead 

More straightforward way is:
 if (evictable) {
evictMap(mapContainer);
                }
