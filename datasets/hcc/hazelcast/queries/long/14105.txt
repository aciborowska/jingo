NPE occurs while executing some EntryProcessors on cluster with enabled "User Code Deplaoyment" feature.

Environment:
- Hazelcast v3.11 (still reproducible on v3.9.4, v3.10.6)
- Enabled "User code deployment" configuration (with implicitly configured ProviderMode.LOCAL_AND_CACHED_CLASSES)
- 3-node cluster: 2 nodes without some new EntryProcessor, 1 node with the new one
- 2 different EntryProcessors defined as static nested classes
