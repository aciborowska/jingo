Hi,
We used hazelcast XA transactions and after update to v.3.5 faced with unexpected behavior: it seems like XA transactions are no more two phase. Data in queue wasn't restored and replicated to second instance after termination of application. Could you please clarify is this normal behavior or not?

Link to testcase with hazelcast v.3.4.5: [link](https://github.com/kiril-akshonau/hz-xa-transaction/tree/3.4)
Link to testcase with hazelcast v.3.5.2: [link](https://github.com/kiril-akshonau/hz-xa-transaction/tree/3.5)
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download mentioned test case
2. Go to hz-xa-transaction folder
3. Run command "gradlew runOffer"
4. Run command "gradlew runPeek"
5. Wait till runPeek application isn't finished

Expected result: runPeek application is finished correctly. "Received object after destroying JVM. Transaction is OK" is in log.

Actual result:
v.3.4.5: application is finished correctly
v.3.5.2: there is no object in queue. Application is finished with exception
