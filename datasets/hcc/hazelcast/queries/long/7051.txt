We use an IdGenerator in our product in lieu of a database sequence value.  Today at a customer the value of the IdGenerator appeared to randomly reset.  I have written a simple test case to reproduce this issue.  Here are the steps to reproduce:
1. Compile and run test case with an integer argument (e.g. java -cp . TestIdGenerator 184699)
2. Run a second instance with a smaller number (e.g. java -cp . TestIdGenerator 1)
3. Stop the first instance
The second instance has now reverted to a value lower than the previous value. I expect that the second instance would continue with incremental ids since the entire cluster was not restarted as is detailed in the docs but this is not the case at all.
