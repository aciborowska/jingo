Following line has a bit wrong definition for `getLostBackupCount` method:

 https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/partition/PartitionLostEvent.java#L31

```
hz.getPartitionService().addPartitionLostListener(partitionLostEvent -> {
            System.out.println(partitionLostEvent.toString());
});
```

It prints as following printouts when single-member left the cluster, and there is no lostBackupCount (it is 0)

```
com.hazelcast.partition.PartitionLostEvent{partitionId=177, lostBackupCount=0, eventSource=[192.168.1.21]:5702}
com.hazelcast.partition.PartitionLostEvent{partitionId=174, lostBackupCount=0, eventSource=[192.168.1.21]:5702}
```
