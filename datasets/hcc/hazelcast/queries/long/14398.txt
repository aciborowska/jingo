When we started to create our spring-boot based application, we included Hazelcast 3.6.x as our dependency and used the following namespace declaration in our spring xml configuration file:

`xsi:schemaLocation="[...]http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring https://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring/hazelcast-spring-3.6.xsd[...]">`

After some time, we switched to Hazelcast 3.8.x:

`xsi:schemaLocation="[...]http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring https://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring/hazelcast-spring-3.8.xsd[...]">`

But the https URLs haven't been added to the spring.schemas file since 3.7.x:

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast-spring/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.schemas

This causes that the xsd file is now downloaded with every application start (when Spring tries to parse the configuration files). This isn't a big problem, but yesterday, when our application needed to be restarted, hazelcast.com answered with http error 404 which prevented our application from starting. :(

I will provide a pull request which adds the missing https URLs to the spring.schemas file.
