the test was passing before, 
when we fixed https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11221

we disabled task removal from the internal j.u.c.ScheduledThreadPool in the last patch on 3.9 to avoid that hanging issue we had with the dispose-all. so now tasks will stay in that pool for 1hr before they get cleaned

https://github.com/hazelcast/hzCmd-bench/blob/zeta/src/main/java/hzcmd/executor/scheduled/ScheduleDispose.java#L20


now we need to use 
```
hazelcast.executionservice.taskscheduler.remove.oncancel
```
 and this should behave as it did before our change.


but it can cause slow operations to the point that the node can hang
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11265
we will try to address this better in 3.10



so issues 
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11221
and
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11265

are related, and we can not fix both of them at the same time, 
currently we are going to hit one of them (oome or hang) depending on how 
`hazelcast.executionservice.taskscheduler.remove.oncancel` is set.
