When any entities are defined as read only in the Hibernate L2 cache, an invalidation of the cache (such as caused by executing a native SQLQuery) leads to the following error:
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Attempting to lock a read-only cache region

This works fine using EHCache as the L2 provider. Is this a bug? It was also reported here some time ago: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hazelcast/R8E2f9k1qBg

Thanks
