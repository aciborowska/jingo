
I was just trying to reproduce the topic issue described in the community channel, as I got OOME from the members,

the hprof is http://54.82.84.143/~jenkins/workspace/temp/HzMember1HZ-topic.hprof

simply i was creating topics using and destroying, and it results in OOME.

the main difference to the usual create-use-destroy test i run is.
before I would operate on the same topic over and over 
where as in this latest fails test,

I create use and destroy a topic with a random name each time.
when we destroy a structure, do we intentionally keep some small amount of data/state about it in the cluster ?

we aren’t supposed to. I’ll take a quick look at the heap dump
looks like we keep the ringbuffers so this might be a bug
