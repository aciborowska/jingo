**Describe the bug**
I am testing a simple program that locks a FencedLock
Two-node cluster. Master locks FencedLock.
Master shuts down. Shutdown takes a long long time (2+ seconds)

**Expected behavior**
Shutdown should occur immediately since almost no data is present in the cluster

**To Reproduce**
Clone https://github.com/flowlogix/hazelcast-issues
`cd CacheTester`
- Run the program (`mvn -Prun test`) 
- hit `c` to create the cache
- hit `l` to lock the lock
- run the program in another window to create another node
- make sure that the nodes are connected together
- hit `<enter>` on master to quit / trigger migration

**Additional context**
There may be other slowness going on besides migration.
In fact, I don't think the migration itself is the most likely problem.
Looks like sleep-like behavior is most likely.
Here is the relevant log (see where it says **two second delay**:
