Plain runnable

```
public class X implements Runnable, Serializable, HazelcastInstanceAware
{

    private transient HazelcastInstance hz;

    @Override
    public void run()
    {
            // do sth with hz
    }

    @Override
    public void setHazelcastInstance(HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance)
    {
        this.hz = hazelcastInstance;
    }
}
```

When scheduled with a name:

```
IScheduledExecutorService executor = hzInstance.getScheduledExecutorService("default");
executor.scheduleAtFixedRate(TaskUtils.named("X_Name", new X()), 5, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```
it doesn't get an instance associated with it.
