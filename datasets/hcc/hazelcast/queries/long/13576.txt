Client connection should detect that a connection is reading but not sending any data to server to detect heartbeat idle case.
Current implementation checks only last read time which is not enough for reading only connections like just simple listener use case.

Possible fix line : [HeartbeatManager.java#L94](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast-client/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/client/connection/nio/HeartbeatManager.java#L94) 

Test Case:

Two member with a single client that registers a Topic listener on the non-owner member.
Member side publish continuous data to topic and client listener consumes it.
After member heartbeat timeout, member-2 will shutdown client as no ping received.
