Hello,
i using hazelcast (tcp discovery) into a docker swarm cluster.

According to official documentation (https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/networking/) swarm assign a VIP and a "fisical" IP for every service.

When a hazelcast member try to connect to another i have a conflict IP because hazelcast match any service with 2 different IP (VIP and IP)

How to resolve it?
