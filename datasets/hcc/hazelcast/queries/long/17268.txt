Consider the following query:
```
SELECT * FROM table WHERE big_decimal_column = CAST(2.0 as REAL)
```
If there is a `HASH` index on the column `big_decimal_column`, and there is an entry with the index key "new BigDecimal(2)", the corresponding entry will not be returned. But if a `SORTED` index is used, then the entry will be returned. 

Thus, the engine will produce different results depending on the index type, which is a bug. The old query engine is affected as well.

The root cause is BigDecimal semantics: if two entries have `compareTo=0`, it doesn't necessarily mean that their `equals=true`. For example, `BigDecimal(2) != BigDecimal(2.0)`.
