HZ 3.5.4.
I have a number of MapStore beans configured for my maps. It used to work perfectly till some HZ update (not sure which one). Now the stores only load data via loadAllKeys/load/loadAll methods, but store/storeAll methods are never invoked any more. I do change data in cache and see the changes, but they're not propagated to the underlying store. 
My MapStotres are configureted as write-behind, but change of it to write-though did not help. Does anyone know what could cause such issue?

Thanks, Denis
