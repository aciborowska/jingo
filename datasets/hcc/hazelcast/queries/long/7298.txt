I am getting this exception while trying to execute a single test which does use `HazelcastTestRunner` (it's the runner which can be parametrized)

```
java.lang.Exception: No tests found matching Method testBasicUsage(com.hazelcast.map.nearcache.NearCacheTest) from org.junit.internal.requests.ClassRequest@12bb4df8
```
