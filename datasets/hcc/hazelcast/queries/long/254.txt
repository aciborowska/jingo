When updating a map entry which is replicated over WAN, the TTL (TimeToLive) is not honoured in the remote cluster map.

I am using the put method of the IMap interface to update/overwrite a cache entry.

V put(K key,
      V value,
      long ttl,
      TimeUnit timeunit)

When the time-out expires, the entry disappears from the cluster in which the key is owned, however it remains in the remote cluster.
