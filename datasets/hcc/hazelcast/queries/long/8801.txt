With #8649 the delivery of JCache near-cache invalidation events was changed as follows:
- `Cache.close` now delivers near-cache invalidation events while it used not to
- `Cache.destroy` no longer delivers invalidation events
- `CacheManager.destroyCache` when invoked from a client-side cache manager no longer delivers invalidation events
