**Describe the bug**
The HealthMonitor only prints zeroes for the GC counts and times. 

`minor.gc.count=0, minor.gc.time=0ms, major.gc.count=0, major.gc.time=0ms,`

Analysis of GC logs show the actual values that should be displayed:

**Expected behavior**
The HealthMonitor logs should print the GC metrics that reflect the up-to-date activity of the garbage collector.

**To Reproduce**

I was able to reproduce the issue using the attached ([reproducer.tar.gz](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/files/4852659/reproducer.tar.gz)) project. It takes an argument for the number of entries to add to an `IMap`. Give enough to surpass a HealthMonitor threshold (such as heap usage).


**Additional context**
* Tested w/ JDK versions 8, 11, and 13
* Tested w/ default collectors as well as setting `-XX:+UseG1GC` explicitly
* Consistently occurs w/ 3.12 (any patch version)

Common details that we're often interested in:
- Detailed description of the steps to reproduce your issue
- Logs and stack traces, if available
- Hazelcast version that you use (e.g. 3.4, also specify whether it is a minor release or the latest snapshot)
- If available, integration module versions (e.g. Tomcat, Jetty, Spring, Hibernate). Also, include their detailed configuration information such as web.xml, Hibernate configuration and `context.xml` for Spring
- Cluster size, i.e. the number of Hazelcast cluster members
- Number of the clients
- Version of Java. It is also helpful to mention the JVM parameters
- Operating system. If it is Linux, kernel version is helpful
- Unit test with the `hazelcast.xml` file. If you could include a unit test which reproduces your issue, we would be grateful
