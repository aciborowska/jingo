As discussed here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hazelcast/goqakkH7Pug it seems that there is a race condition between map.clear() and bringing data into a map from a backup node after a full cluster restart.

In essence, clearing a map as the first operation after a cluster restart causes the data flowing in from backup nodes to trigger bogus MapStore.store() calls.

Te resolve this, please ensure the map is either completely in sync with its peers before allowing a map.clear() call, or somehow avoid a cleared map be populated with stale data.

Edit: I found that it does not really matter much whether I call map.clear() or anything else. The first operation triggers a re-popultion of the map and the bogus store() events.
