Hazelcast 2.5.1
I have an issue with migration of partition data.
Scenario:
1 node up and running, then a second one joining the cluster. They find each other (no matter if Multicast or TCP/IP) and connect. Then when migration happens, everything looks OK for the master node, but the migration is never finished on the other. When checking the mancenter, on master everything is good, besides that all partition data is on master, but on the other there is the message "Ongoing Migration On Cluster There are  scheduled,  immediate migration tasks." and cluster is not really administrable here.
Checking the MBeans and accessing shared-maps all works also from the 2nd node.
The situation only resolves itself, if I shut-down the master-node, then the 2nd node becomes master and also its state, which is shown via mancenter returns to normal.

I will attach 2 screenshots of master and 2nd node, also the log looks suspicous to me, since on master there are the full No. of expected MigrationEvents (total: partitionIds=271), but on 2nd node some of them are missing (e.g. starts not before index 8.). Seems as if com.hazelcast.impl.PartitionManager.fireMigrationEvent() would not be called on 2nd node?!

Log-file of master is here: http://pastebin.com/ntHdSjGb
Log-file of 2nd node is here: http://pastebin.com/VMpxyyUY
