In addition to key and value types, the following need to be deferred:
```cacheLoaderFactory, cacheWriterFactory, expiryPolicyFactory and listenerConfigurations```
The above also rely for their classes to exist in current Class Loader and may not,
causing the node initialization failures.

There should be a similar fix for these as in key and value types.
Suggestion would be to transfer an array of bytes rather than objects for these values,
and actually de-serialize them only when needed.
