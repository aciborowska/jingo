I'm trying to use distributed map (IMap) for temporary caching;
have a unit test with following relevant presets:
- TtimeToLive - is set to 10seconds
- cache size: 20 
- max size policy: cluster_wide_map_size

the IMap is being populated _only_ via MapLoader.loadAll(Kyes)  
i.e i never perform operations like put/putIfAbsent directly in IMap,  so basically the IMap caches whatever it finds in my persistence layer. 

issue:
The problem is using this approach the cache size is being ignored. I easily got IMap to store >60 entries.

workaround:
performing IMap.puts will keep size under 20 as expected. 

is there a way to perform something like IMap.ensureSize() ?
- version 2.1.2

thx
