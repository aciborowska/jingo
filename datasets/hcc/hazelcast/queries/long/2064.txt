`HazelcastQueryResultsRegion` always uses a `LocalRegionCache` for query caches and passes in `null` for the HazelcastInstance. The reason for this is documented in code:

> // Note: We can pass HazelcastInstance as null, because instead of invalidation
> // timestamps cache can take care of outdated queries. 

However, passing a `null` `HazelcastInstance` has an (unintended?) side effect: the map config cannot be retrieved, which means that the query caches cannot be configured. Instead a default maxSize of 10,000 and a TTL of 1 hour is applied.
