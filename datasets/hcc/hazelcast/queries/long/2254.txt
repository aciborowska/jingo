I have a Cluster of hazelcast nodes and some client connecting to it. If the network connection to a client holding a lock goes down, the lock is not released. This only works if I shutdown or kill the client but not on sudden network failure. The connection is still listed as connected. Shouldn't there be a heartbeat timeout?
