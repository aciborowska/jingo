Hi,

Hazelcast 3.0 introduced some files in META-INF/services which are read while starting the server instances. It would be good to display error/warning if those files are not found. Similar to "hazelcast.xml not found in classpath". 

Without this error/warning, it will be difficult to find the cause. (for more info, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hazelcast/Vx2DlGGKV6E)

If it didn't find "com.hazelcast.PortableHook" file then we get following exception,

SEVERE: [16.154.181.109]:5701 [dev] Error while initializing service: Could not find PortableFactory for factoryId: -3
