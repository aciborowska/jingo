If a system loads a lot of data and needs to build up a large index, then the client will run into problems. It isn't a good out of the box experience because effectively it means that we can't rely on loading a lot of data. 

So imagine a slow database load taking several minutes; then every operation that is parked behind this operation is going to timeout. Database loading should always be offloaded.
