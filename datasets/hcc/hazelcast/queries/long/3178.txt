When deleting item that does not exist in a map, `IMap` calls `MapLoader.load()`. This is understandable in case of `IMap.remove()` as it returns removed value (or `null`). But `IMap.delete()`, despite returning `void`, still calls `MapLoader.load()`. My `MapLoader` implementation is quite heavyweight, thus I would like to avoid calling it for no particular reason.

The problematic code lies in [`DefaultRecordStore.java:485`](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/v3.2.4/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/map/DefaultRecordStore.java#L485). Hazelcast, version 3.2.4.
