I think it is caused by a data race. 
- So the OperationRunner.currentTask is seen as slow.
- The operation completes, so current task is null
- The SlowOperationLog is created by accessing the OperationRunner.currentTask. 
  which leads to the NPE. 

So make sure you take a 'snapshot' of reality that is valid instead of dealing with something that moves underneath your feet. In most cases storing the operation in a local variable (and passing it around) is the best approach to deal with this.

Could also be that something else is happening :)
