Initial Cluster information
```
Size: 3
Version: Hazelcast 3.9.2
Client Count: 1
Client Docker : FROM openjdk:8-slim (debian)
Member Docker: FROM openjdk:8-jre (debian)
Client log level: DEBUG [slf4j]
Member log level: ALL [jdk]
```
Steps:
1] Sanity check for HZ 3.9.2-EE cluster has member count 3 and all of them `active`
2] Run RU to HZ 3.10-SNAPSHOT EE
3] Verify no exceptions and failures during RU
4] Sanity check on 3.10-SNAPSHOT EE
5] Apply network delays to 2 members of cluster
6] Verify that cluster size drops to `1` that is below quorum size of `ISet`. `ISet` also uses PQ for 3.10-SNAPSHOT EE configuration
7] Collect statistics for 20 secs 
8] Expect Quorum exceptions only

However we got below statistics
```
QuorumStatistics(success=158, failures=0, exceptions=0, quorumExceptions=79)
```
`success` metrics greater than `0` is not expected.

Please note that when we apply below quorum setting in 3.10-SNAPSHOT configuration for `ISet` we got **all** Quorum exceptions as expected
```
<quorum enabled="true" name="pq">
        <quorum-size>2</quorum-size>
        <quorum-type>READ_WRITE</quorum-type>
    </quorum>
```

Logs are attached as below

Logs for members are also follow RU pattern, which means member `1` is upgraded with `4`.

1->4
2->5
3->6
