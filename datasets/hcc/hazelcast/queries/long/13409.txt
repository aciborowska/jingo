Like this old post: https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/2343, i am facing the same problem. When i use a ReplicatedMap with the 3.9.3 version (I tried the 3.10.2 it's the same), i set a TTL when i put an entry into my replicated map. But when i clear the map, the heap still contains a lot of instances of SecondsBasedEntryTaskScheduler (~3 Go). Any tips to make it work with ReplicatedMap ? Thanks in advance.
