
from this shutdown job 
https://hazelcast-l337.ci.cloudbees.com/view/shutdown/job/shutdown-All/18/consoleFull
the first fail was 
```
/disk1/jenkins/workspace/shutdown-All/3.9-SNAPSHOT/2017_06_14-05_30_54/stable/destroy/create-use-destroy Failed
```
with
```HzClient4HZ _create-use-destroy_createUseDestroy_mapBak1HD_queryCache hzcmd.map.cqc.CreateUseDestroy threadId=0 com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastException: com.hazelcast.core.MemberLeftException: Member [10.0.0.165]:5701 - 51cd3b27-8fae-403b-b81a-beb961c505fa has left cluster! ```

so the client / user / me  received a very generic `com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastException`  
and not the `com.hazelcast.core.MemberLeftException`  
i can handle the `MemberLeftException` as i expect it in a shutdown case.  
but i can not do any thing with the generic  `HazelcastException`
  
why don't i get the correct exception ?
