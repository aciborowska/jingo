Hi,

I'm using hibernate bundle to set automatically the L2 cache into my hazelcast cluster.
All works correctly, but when I want to display the content (key/values) of a particular map, I obtain always zero size.

For example, I have a entity called com.myproj.MyEntity.
From mancenter I see that this entity has 10 entry, so I click to console menu, then execute:
- ns com.myproj.MyEntity;
- m.size

But the results is always zero. Seems that the command "ns <namespace>" doesn't change the namespace that remains on default.
Where is my mistake?
