Hi,

I have used hazelcast mechanism in my project and hazelcast instance is creating through spring.

My environment is AIX with WebSphere.

Issues is while start of the server : ERROR: Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No bean named 'HazelcastInstance' is defined

By seeing error, my initial impression was the Websphere server is not finding hazelcast (i.e hazelcast-all-2.4.1.jar) supported jar.

I would appreciate any help.

Thanks,
Sekhar.G
