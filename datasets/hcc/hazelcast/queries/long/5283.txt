I tried to use this method to null-out all variables as per contract (...intended to cleanup internal state...) but got null-pointers later.

Once the mapping is done, the _DefaultContext#finish()_ first calls the _finalizeCombine()_ on all combiners and then calls (suspicious) _requestChunk()_ which in turn calls _finalizeChunk() + reset()_ that most probably rely on internal state which is now gone.

Maybe I got the usage wrong, would then somebody be able to explain a proper use-case?
