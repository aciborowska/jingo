On 4.1-BETA-1

These work
```
        String query = "SELECT firstName FROM " + mapName + " WHERE lastName = 'Stevenson'";
        String query = "SELECT firstName FROM \"" + mapName + "\" WHERE lastName = 'Stevenson'";
```

But this fails
```
        String query = "SELECT firstName FROM '" + mapName + "' WHERE lastName = 'Stevenson'";
```
with
```
Was expecting one of:
    "LATERAL" ...
    "TABLE" ...
    "UNNEST" ...
    <IDENTIFIER> ...
    <QUOTED_IDENTIFIER> ...
    <BACK_QUOTED_IDENTIFIER> ...
    <BRACKET_QUOTED_IDENTIFIER> ...
    <UNICODE_QUOTED_IDENTIFIER> ...
    "(" ...
    
```

Map name should be able to be surrounded by single quotes to be consistent with field values.
