When enabling the near cache for my Hazelcast map, I am seeing excessive memory usage due to millions of instances of `InvalidateNearCacheOperation`.

From inspection of the heap dump, I believe that these objects (wrapped in `InvocationImpl`s, which are in turn wrapped in `RemoteCall`s) are being retained in the `remoteCalls` map in `OperationServiceImpl`.  From inspection of the source code, it appears that the only ways that entries can get removed from this map are:
- if they are instances of `ResponseOperation` (in which case `notifyRemoteCall` is called which leads to the entry being removed)
- if sending the operation fails immediately from `OperationServiceImpl.send` (in which case the entry is immediately de-registered at the bottom of `InvocationImpl.doInvoke`)

This analysis seems to be supported by this comment in `OperationServiceImpl`:

`// TODO: @mm - operations those do not return response can cause memory leaks! Call->Invocation->Operation->Data`
