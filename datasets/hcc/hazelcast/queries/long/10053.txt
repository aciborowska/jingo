`RANDOM` is a valid [eviction policy](https://github.com/jerrinot/hazelcast/blob/77ee1969666d385b1bcbc6a6294911f398b7e9fd/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/config/EvictionPolicy.java#L37-L37), but it appears it's not permitted [in the XSD](https://github.com/jerrinot/hazelcast/blob/77ee1969666d385b1bcbc6a6294911f398b7e9fd/hazelcast/src/main/resources/hazelcast-config-3.8.xsd#L2792-L2792)

The XSD contraint should be relaxed to allow `RANDOM` policy. Also Spring configuration should be checked.
