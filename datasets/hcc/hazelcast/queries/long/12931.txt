See https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/cache/impl/operation/CachePutBackupOperation.java#L72

When entry evicted on primary member, it also evicts on backup members. This causes `LocalCacheStats.getCacheEvictions` return wrong numbers.

Please see below ManCenter screenshot. Even though only 1 entry evicted, see put count & entry count, it seems 2 entry evicted.
