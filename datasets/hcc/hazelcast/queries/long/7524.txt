This is related to issue #6615. It seems the issue was fixed for one node setup only. When I have cluster with two nodes the custome credentials class is properly deserialized on the first node:

`2016-02-15 23:00:33.308 [hz.default.client.thread-1] INFO  c.h.c.i.protocol.task.AuthenticationCustomCredentialsMessageTask - [192.168.10.20]:10500 [default] [3.6] Received auth from Connection [/192.168.10.20:10500 -> /192.168.10.10:14744], endpoint=null, alive=true, type=JAVA_CLIENT, successfully authenticated, principal : ClientPrincipal{uuid='a81b0e38-3190-4947-90ce-591c9fb79a7f', ownerUuid='5b58ffaf-49bd-4653-8893-ea17cbcf7d12'}, owner connection : true
`

but not on the second node:

`2016-02-15 23:01:56.278 [hz.default.client.thread-1] WARN  c.hazelcast.client.impl.protocol.task.AuthenticationMessageTask - [192.168.30.30]:10500 [default] [3.6] Received auth from Connection [/192.168.30.30:10500 -> /192.168.30.10:40286], endpoint=null, alive=true, type=NONE with principal ClientPrincipal{uuid='a81b0e38-3190-4947-90ce-591c9fb79a7f', ownerUuid='5b58ffaf-49bd-4653-8893-ea17cbcf7d12'} , authentication failed
`

Please have a look.
