Current behaviour:

**Given** a topic listener created through Config,

**When** the first Hz instance starts,
**And** then there is a pause,
**And** then the second Hz instance starts,

**Then** messages broadcast to the topic from the first Hz instance will not be broadcast to the second node.

The problem appears to be with registration of the list of Address objects that the local TopicInstance should broadcast to; in the situation above, one of the nodes will have one Address, the other will have two Addresses.

Workaround is to register the listener on the topic once the instance has been created.
