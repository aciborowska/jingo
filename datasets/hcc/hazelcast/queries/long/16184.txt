The name of the cluster in `hazelcast-full-example.yaml` is set incorrectly with 
```
hazelcast:
  cluster:
    name: clusterName
```
This was not caught by the tests since the XML counterpart uses the default cluster name. The same is true for other YAML configuration files:
- `hazelcast-fullconfig-without-network.yaml`
- `hazelcast-default.yaml`
- `hazelcast-client-full.yaml`
- `hazelcast-client-full-example.yaml`
