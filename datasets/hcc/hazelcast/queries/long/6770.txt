Here is the scenario for the issue:
1. A cluster with 7 members (6 lite, 1 regular) sets up. Configured merge policy for maps is hz.ADD_NEW_ENTRY.
2. Split brain occurs with 4 lite members to 2 lite + 1 regular members.
3. After join, smaller cluster with three members join to larger one. All three members restart for merge.
4. Data loss occurs after merge.

The expected behaviour is to recover all data after merge operations.
