When using Indexes, an `IndexAwarePredicate` doesnt have its `apply` method invoked - so despite whatever code maybe present in there its not used - only the index operation is performed and the apply filter is silently ignored.  

It would be helpful if the apply method was invoked since we could get different runtime results when an index is present or not - and I dont believe that data results should change simply due to a HZ configuration change.
