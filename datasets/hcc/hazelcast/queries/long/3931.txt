I consider this to be a bug because it causes some side effect like behaviour when using MapInterceptors. I could reproduce this with versions 3.2, 3.3 and 3.3.1 so it could be a feature, although the following behaviour is counter intuitive and not documented.

If you add a MapInterceptor to a map on initialization of your server and then run the same code on multiple nodes, you will get the same behaviour duplicated when the MapInterceptor is invoked. For example if you append some string to the value on intercepting _get_ then the value will be appended n times for n nodes in the cluster.

It makes sense to chain MapInterceptors of different types, but instances of same class just duplicates behaviour.

The MapInterceptor is also not removed when the node leaves the cluster but I'll add another issue to track that, just in case this turns out not to be a bug.

For a demonstration of this behaviour see the code here:
