A configuration replacers section this is imported does not replace variables in the file that imports it.

This fails to replace the group name,
```
<import resource="classpath:hazelcast3.xml"/>
<group>
    <name>$ENC{......}</name>
</group>           
```
If the imported file `hazelcast3.xml` contains a `<config-replacers>` section, the group name in the main XML file is not replaced.




Tested on 3.12.2, same behaviour with YAML as XML.
