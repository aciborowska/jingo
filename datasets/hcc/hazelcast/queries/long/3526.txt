When using a custom partionining strategy and the configured backup count of a map can not be fulfilled since a node defined in the custom partition group is down, a JMX service call is blocked in the while-loop at com.hazelcast.map.MapService.createLocalMapStats. 

To me, the comparison of the cluster size with the map's backup count is problematic here, since the cluster size is not equal to the number of nodes being capable to hold replicas in case of custom partition groups.
