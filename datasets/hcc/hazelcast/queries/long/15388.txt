In ServiceManager exceptions are only logged but this doesn't start the node from starting up:

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/spi/impl/servicemanager/impl/ServiceManagerImpl.java#L220

This is contradictory to our fail-fast principle and forces services to implement their own exception handling to abort node startup.
