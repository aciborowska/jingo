When using Hazelcast's TransactionalMap to hold Entry(key:String, value:CustomEntity), I am facing a problem when trying to get an entry in a TransactionalTask. There is no problem when putting the entry to the cache, serialization of the object is done successfully; but when I try to the get the entry in a different TransactionalTask, HazelcastInstance itself is trying to load the class of object to be deserialized and it could not find it, and throws ClassNotFoundException.

I run Hazelcast Instance as a windows service using server.bat file (I do not programmatically initialize Hazelcast Instance). In application code (Tomcat container and Spring application context) through the hazelcast-client jar dependency, I am getting Hazelcast client object and by using that, achive communicating with Hazelcast Instance.

When I add the jar of custom entities to the classpath of HazelcastInstance (java -server -cp "../lib/hazelcast-3.2.3.jar;../lib/customEntity.jar"  com.hazelcast.examples.TestApp), the problem is solved. But I do not want to make HazelcastInstance to be dependent to the entity.jar.

In hazelcast.xml configuration file:
- in-memory-format for Maps' default configuration (<map name="default">): "BINARY" 
- no specific configuration for TransactionalMap

Can someone have any idea of what the source of the problem really is and can anyone offer a solution or workaround for this issue. 

Thanks in advance.
