Affected:
- `com.hazelcast.config.PNCounterConfig#isStatisticsEnabled`
- `com.hazelcast.config.ReliableTopicConfig#isStatisticsEnabled`

Stats are collected regardless of the config and the config only affects if they are sent to mancenter (in `com.hazelcast.internal.management.TimedMemberStateFactory`). If the stats are disabled, they should probably not be collected at all.
