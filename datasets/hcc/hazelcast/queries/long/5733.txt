The IMap operations have uniformative toString implementations. The toString of the Operation is very informative and contains the call id and a lot of other information.

Probably it is best to add an additional method to Operation like toPartialString and instead of doing:

```
  @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "BasePutOperation{" + name + "}";
    }
```

You do e.g.

```
  @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "BasePutOperation{name=" + name+", "+ toPartialString()+ "}";
    }
```

This way it is easy to add additional field information to a toString.

If we do not fix these toString implementation, it could very well be that we can't analyze logging because a lot of relevant information has been dropped.
