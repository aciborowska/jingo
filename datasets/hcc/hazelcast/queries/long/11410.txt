The application wastes CPU cycles on serialization here:

when  called from Jet [StreamEventJournalP.poll()](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/blob/fbe68f865bb6e877d4e9a3863f9c892d14fe36aa/hazelcast-jet-core/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/impl/connector/StreamEventJournalP.java#L136) repeatedly. 

Example: 10 active SourceProcessors.streamMap() instances generate 20% cpu constant load on empty maps. 
I would expect the projection to be applied only when event arrives.
