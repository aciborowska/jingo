In case of submitting a callable to a member via IExecutorService there is no guarantee that future.cancel will work after callable start to run.(Because they do not run on an assigned partition thread) 
I added new  tests as ClientExecutorServiceCancelTest to demonstrate the failure. Related tests are currently ignored. Although tests is for client there is a high probability that this is an issue for nodes also.(I did not check it).

ClientExecutorServiceCancelTest is introduced with this pr https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/4675
