Commit failure on clients sets the transaction state to ROLLING_BACK, which makes the transaction non-rollbackable. This is not a problem for lock-based data structures (map, multimap) but it is problematic for collections. Since Hazelcast does not have an `auto-release the resources` for collections yet (planned for 3.8) one should call rollback explicitly upon commit failure in order to release resources.
