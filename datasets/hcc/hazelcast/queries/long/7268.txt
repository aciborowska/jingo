`minEvictionCheckMillis` controls maximum frequency of evictions. It's 100ms by default. It means at most 1 eviction will be executed in a 100ms interval. No other `put()` within this interval will trigger an eviction -> if `put` rate is greater than 1 per 100ms than number of entries is growing regardless of max. size policy -> _Max size config is effectively ignored!_

This eventually triggers a forced eviction which will prevent OOM -> forced evictions are only hiding this issue. 

Another possible solution is keep the default interval as it is and apply batching: When we skip X eviction cycles due the `minEvictionCheckMillis` parameter then during the next cycle we should evict `X + 1` entries instead of just 1.
