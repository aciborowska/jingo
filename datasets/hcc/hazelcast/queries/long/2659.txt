Failing test:

```
@Test
public void testTTL_lessThan1ms() {
    final IMap<String, String> map = createHazelcastInstance().getMap(randomMapName());
    map.put("foo", "bar", 1, TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS);

    assertTrueEventually(new AssertTask() {
        @Override
        public void run() throws Exception {
            assertNull(map.get("foo"));
        }
    });
}
```

It's because getTimeInMillis() returns 0 and that is treated as indefinite TTL according to IMap contract.

I'm not sure what's a best way to fix it, but I'm sure the current behaviour is a bug.
