Findings after a little bit investigation, 
Context is set to Proxy only when initializing. Null context means it is not initialized properly. 
Bug seems to be caused by following line:
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast-client/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/client/spi/ProxyManager.java#L336
 if user gets an exception and wait in the line above, after retryCountLimit is reached, we are returning as if it is initialized successfully. Actually initialization is not successful : context is not set to proxy.
