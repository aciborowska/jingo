We have been experiencing that HZ clients shutdown in case of an IP change of one or more of the configured node (DNS) addresses. 

Steps that led to the problem:
1. Cluster with two nodes
2. Clients are configured to access cluster nodes via FQDN
3. Shutdown of both cluster nodes
4. (clients try to reconnect)
5. Cluster nodes come up again
6. During startup, cluster nodes get new (private) IP addresses, which are registered at the DNS service
7. It seems that there is a small time window where the FQDN has no IP assigned/configured at the DNS service, because accessing `InetAddress address = inetSocketAddress.getAddress();` https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/3.3.4/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/nio/Address.java#L198 evaluates to null. Since this exception is nowhere handled, `ClusterListenerThread.run` shuts down the client https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/3.3.4/hazelcast-client/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/client/spi/impl/ClusterListenerThread.java#L83-L94. 

We are experiencing this issue with 3.3.1, but as far as I can see the code in the master (i.e., 3.4) is the same. 

I would suggest to handle the exception directly here https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/3.4/hazelcast-client/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/client/spi/impl/ClusterListenerThread.java#L258-L260, but this may also have an impact on initial connection attempts (where it may be desired to quit immediately).
