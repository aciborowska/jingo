When WAN Replication is configured with `<queue-full-behavior>THROW_EXCEPTION</queue-full-behavior>` and the WAN Replication Queue is already full, the following error message is shown in the console:  

`Error: WANReplicationQueueFullException[WAN replication for WAN publisher paris is full. Queue capacity is 1000]`

This error message does not make it clear that the transaction has failed and that the submitted data has not been accepted.
