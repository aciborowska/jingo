User Code Deployment is not capable of resolving the package private classes and interfaces. We found this while developing a Map Store Support for the Hazelcast Cloud. When some class inside the Hikari Connection Pool references a package private stuff - it fails with the IllegalAccessError on the attempt to load it:
```
{
  "errorMessage": "class com.zaxxer.hikari.pool.PoolBase$NopMetricsTrackerDelegate cannot access its superinterface com.zaxxer.hikari.pool.PoolBase$IMetricsTrackerDelegate",
  "errorType": "java.lang.IllegalAccessError",
  "stackTrace": [
    "java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)",
    "java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:763)",
    "java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:642)",
    "com.hazelcast.internal.usercodedeployment.impl.ClassSource.define(ClassSource.java:50)",
    "com.hazelcast.internal.usercodedeployment.impl.ClassLocator.tryToGetClassFromRemote(ClassLocator.java:163)",
    "com.hazelcast.internal.usercodedeployment.impl.ClassLocator.handleClassNotFoundException(ClassLocator.java:95)",
```

**Now, this fully blocks the end-to-end scenario working at our side.**

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is that the uploaded JAR, with all its dependencies, will be correctly loaded and the Map Store instance will be successfully created and initialized.

**To Reproduce**
See the branch with reproducer - https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cloud-code-samples/tree/hazelcast.code-deployment.issue. Steps to reproduce right here.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Checkout branch `hazelcast.code-deployment.issue`
3. cd `mapstore`
4. Open README.md

**Additional context**
This was noticed when testing the JDBC Map Store sample but in our case it can be any implementation and hence any set of dependencies.
Hazelcast ver. 3.12.6
In our case, we share the uploaded JARs through the lite members. 

When we inspected the source code, we noticed that for every loaded class it creates a separate class loader. So we suspect it can be causing this issue.
