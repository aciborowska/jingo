I use Lock and Map via hazelcast.I find that the heap memory on hazelcast server keep increasing.All the Locks and Maps I created  are destroyed by method destroy(),but the memory can not be destroyed by garbage collector even via FGC.So when my program run for some time,hazelcast server will go down.
Why?
    I dumped the heap,and find that Locks and Maps has been destroyed.However, many other objects related to Locks and Maps  are not been destroyed.So the more new Locks and Maps I create,the faster the heap increases.
   There are the kind of object relavant still exist in heap when I destroy Lock and Map:
1.ConcurrentMap<ObjectNamespace, EntryTaskScheduler> evictionProcessors in LockServiceImpl 
2.ConcurrentMap<ObjectNamespace, LockStoreImpl> lockStores in LockStoreContainer 
3.ConcurrentMap<String, LocalMapStatsImpl> statsMap in LocalMapStatsProvider
   Is this bugs of hazelcast?  or hazelcast doesnt surpport the scene that keep creating  new DistributedObjects and destroy them?
  Attach files is the screenshot of the heap distribution.
expecting your answer,thanks
