We have observed UI issues in hazelcast in 3.x versions.

UI starts wobbling with increase in entries.

Total maps : 5 

Total entries per Map is around 2 Million except one map which has around 93 thousand entries.  

Map Sizes:

Maps having 2 Millions entries:
Map1 - 375 MB 
Map2- 935 MB
Map 3- 880 MB
Map 4- 415 Mb

Map with 93 k entries - 16 MB

We have tried hazelcast 3.3.3 , 3.3.5 and 3.4.1 . It works fine in hazelcast 2.6.9 version.
