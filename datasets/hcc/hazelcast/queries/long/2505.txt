Hi @ahmetmircik ,

I'm currently having some trouble to get my application up and running with multiple nodes... using 3.2.2-SNAPSHOT.

I have several maps with a MapStore each. Starting one node works fine. Then, when I add a second node, on this second node the MapStores are initialized when creating the MapContainer objects. In the constructor of MapContainer, initMapStoreOperations() is called which in turn calls initMapStore() which then calls loadInitialKeys().

In short: MapStore.loadAllKeys() is called on the second node as well. I think this is wrong, since the first node already loaded all the hot keys needed for that map.

To circument that issue, I added a check in loadAllKeys() if the node is joining a cluster or not. If it was joining, I simply returned null to _not_ load further hot keys. Now, in earlier versions of Hazelcast, this was working fine. With 3.2.2-SNAPSHOT, however, the loadAllKeys() is called earlier - at a point where I don't yet have the Hazelcast instance and therefore are no able to check if the node is joining or not.

What do you think? Does MapStore.loadAllKeys() have to be called on a second node?

Thanks and best,
Lukas
