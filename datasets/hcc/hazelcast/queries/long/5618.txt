While loading values and putting them to cache in `Cache::loadAll`, it is possible that previously loaded value may be evicted if cache reaches to its max size during loading but its key is returned as loaded. Then at `CacheLoadAllOperation`, records of loaded keys are retrieved from cache and sent through `CachePutAllBackupOperation`. But if records of some keys are evicted during loading, null values are sent in backup operation and this causes NPE while putting records (some of them are null) to cache at ``CachePutAllBackupOperation` on other nodes.
