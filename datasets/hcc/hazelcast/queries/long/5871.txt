hazelcast-all-3.5.2 creates a lot of extra sessions in tomcat /manager/html/sessions while using "Filter Based Web Session Replication" solution.

Test plan:
1. use hazelcast-filter in web.xml
2) run tomcat8 on separated nodes and switch between tomcat nodes using c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
3) open tomcat manager/html/sessions on all nodes and check a list of sessions.

You should see extra sessions in tomcat manager.
Some of the sessions connected to static resources (.css, .js, etc). Some of the sessions created with a random id.

When hazelcast filter creates a HZ session, we should have one session in tomcat manager.
