When using write-behind and entries are evicted, which have not been stored yet, duplicate calls to the map store is made. This results in errors when the primary key is part of the map entry data and duplicate records in the database when it is not.

I will add a stabilizer test to illustrate this. It is easily reproducible when the mapstore is slow.
