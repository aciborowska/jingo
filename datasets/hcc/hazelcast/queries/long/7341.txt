When **MapConfig** option _"readBackupData"_ is set to true then "get" operations do not trigger the update of access timestamps and hit count. This way the entries might get evicted even though they are frequently used. 

Cause of this issue is in _com.hazelcast.map.impl.DefaultRecordStore#readBackupData_ method.
