i get this really often. i checked the source code and the only problem i see is the reset function which can eventually called on wrong thread (their is no check if it is the service thread):

public void reset() {
        sortedMap.clear();
        for (CacheEntry entry : cache.values()) {
            entry.invalidate();
        }
        cache.clear();
  }
