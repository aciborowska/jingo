Presently, in the `QueryConverter` we just throw away the top-level `RootRel` produced by the Calcite. 
But this top-level object carries important information about the top-level projection and possibly sorting. Consider the query:
```
SELECT f1 FROM t ORDER BY f2
```

The following plan will be produced:
```
RootRel[f1]
  Sort[f2 ASC]
    Project[f1, f2]
      Scan[t]
```
Given that we throw away `RootRel` without additional considerations, the last [f1] projection is lost. 

We need to investigate how to deal with this top-level operator. One idea is to convert it to another project.
