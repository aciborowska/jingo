With Hazelcast 3.1 it is not possible to cancel a submitted task via the native client. 
1) Call "executor.submit(task)" from Hazelcast client to start the task.
2) Call "cancel(true)" on the returned future object from the Hazelcast client.

The "Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()" check in the task always returns false.  The call to "cancel(true)" did return true indicating that the task was cancelled successfully, but the tasks continues on.
