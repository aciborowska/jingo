**hazelcast-ra-2.1.2.rar does not deploy on JBoss 7.1.1.Final. The following validation errors are logged:**

Severity: ERROR
Section: 6.5.3.2
Description: A ManagedConnectionFactory must implement a "public int hashCode()" method.
Code: com.hazelcast.jca.ManagedConnectionFactoryImpl

Severity: ERROR
Section: 19.4.2
Description: A ResourceAdapter must implement a "public int hashCode()" method.
Code: com.hazelcast.jca.ResourceAdapterImpl

Severity: ERROR
Section: 19.4.2
Description: A ResourceAdapter must implement a "public boolean equals(Object)" method.
Code: com.hazelcast.jca.ResourceAdapterImpl

Severity: ERROR
Section: 6.5.3.2
Description: A ManagedConnectionFactory must implement a "public boolean equals(Object)" method.
Code: com.hazelcast.jca.ManagedConnectionFactoryImpl

**Also, JBoss 7 is significantly different from JBoss 6 and the example configuration provided in the Hazelcast documentation no longer applies. I put the following in my standalone.xml to enable the resource adapter. I think it's correct but I'm not sure.**

```
    <subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:resource-adapters:1.0">
        <resource-adapters>
            <resource-adapter>
                <archive>hazelcast-ra-2.1.2.rar</archive>
                <transaction-support>LocalTransaction</transaction-support>
                <connection-definitions>
                    <connection-definition class-name="com.hazelcast.jca.ConnectionFactoryImpl" jndi-name="java:/HazelcastCF"/>
                </connection-definitions>
            </resource-adapter>
        </resource-adapters>
    </subsystem>
```
