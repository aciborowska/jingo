I am trying to initialize Hazelcast client using Eureka registry ( the Hz members are registered in Eureka). The initialization fails. Upon debugging, I found that the ALIAS_MAPPINGS in the class com.hazelcast.config.AliasedDiscoveryConfigUtils has wrong entry for Eureka. It is com.hazelcast.eureka.one.HazelcastKubernetesDiscoveryStrategy, but the correct value should be com.hazelcast.eureka.one.EurekaOneDiscoveryStrategy.
