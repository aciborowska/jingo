<b>Sometimes I can see this error in log:</b>
<i>INFO: HazelcastClient is CLIENT_CONNECTION_LOST
Dec 18, 2012 1:25:59 PM com.hazelcast.client.ConnectionManager
WARNING: Server didn't respond to client's requests for 5 seconds. Assuming it is dead, closing the connection!
Exception in thread "Timer-0" java.lang.NullPointerException
    at com.hazelcast.client.ConnectionManager$1.run(ConnectionManager.java:94)
    at java.util.TimerThread.mainLoop(Timer.java:555)
    at java.util.TimerThread.run(Timer.java:505)
</i>    

I cannot reproduce it - but I think I know how to fix it.
When a hazelcast client is created, it starts a heartbeat timer.
If an exception from the run method of the TimerTask is not caught, the timer is stopped - and no further scheduling happens.

I think the patch bellow may fix it:
