**Describe the bug**
Key loading mechanism makes use of batching. But it expects to see key-count of a partition equal to 1000 to close a batch.

If you have 100_000 partitions and each partition loads 999 keys, you will end up 99_900_000 keys loaded in memory. And let's say one key size is 100 byte, you will need nearly 10G heap only to put loaded keys(this is without heap needs of internal data structures).

Things get cumbersome if you have multiple maps to load from the same node under this situation.


**Expected behavior**
There can be a node-wide limit to control heap usage of key loading mechanism.
