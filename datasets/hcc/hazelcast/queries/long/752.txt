The xsd and xmlconfigbuilder (and I guess also the xmlconfiggenerator) use multicast-time-to-live-seconds and not multicast-time-to-live. The multicast ttl is an abstract concept and not related to time. In the config it also isn't called 'seconds' but just ttl.

I need to verify if this bug only is a hz 3 issue or perhaps also a hz 2 issue.
