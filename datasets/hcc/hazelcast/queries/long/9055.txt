I am using MultiMap implementation for my use case, I need to use MultiMap.lock(key) feature to make sure same key is not getting modified concurrently, i have noticed that the lock(key) method gets called and randomly the thread does not acquire a lock and get stuck forever, I have seen this behavior consistently but on random keys, no specific keys pattern. Most of the keys are unique, i would say 99% of them are unique but 1% of them may be duplicate and need to be handled in multi-threaded env and hence using lock(key) feature. My key column is of type String and using hazelcast and client with version 3.7

```
String key = getKey();
MultiMap<String, String> mmap = hz.getMultiMap("SampleMap");
mmap.lock(key)  //This line is where thread gets stuck and does not come out
//Do something
mmpa.unlock(key);
```

Is here any issue with lock feature of MultiMap, any help is very much appreciated..?
