If an exception happens during a direct call to `sendResponse` (for example, for an async op where response is sent from another thread) then any exceptions thrown are not handled and the caller is kept waiting, without receiving any response.

This can happen for example if a non-serializable Exception is being sent as a response.

Note: it needs some care here for careful exception handling, or it can go into a loop trying to send the response.
