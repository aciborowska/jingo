When a cluster member hangs a few minutes, cluster assumes that frozen node as dead and master kicks it. When frozen node comes back, after some time they figure out split and merge back. Problem is, some of the lock requests hang forever without a timeout after the merge. That means some of the previously acquired locks cannot be released and hanging in cluster infinitely, no one can acquire them and there's no one to release them anymore.
