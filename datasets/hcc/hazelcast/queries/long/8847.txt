When clients lose connection to the nodes in the cluster, even after the clients reconnected to the cluster, the Entry/MessageListeners never fired again.

When this happens, it happens silently & there are no log messages to give any indication that there is a problem. (You can see the client lose connection & reconnect, but see no sign that the listeners have not been restored)
