We have noticed a new error message in our logs saying:
ERROR [STDERR] [Fatal Error] :6:3: The element type "hr" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "&lt;/hr&gt;".

It seems the source of the error is VersionCheck which uses hardcoded domain name to fetch XML version document at https://hazelcast.com/version.jsp?version=2.6.1.
This url redirects to a new domain. However, VersionCheck doesn't follow HTTP redirect and attempts to parse returned HTML document.
