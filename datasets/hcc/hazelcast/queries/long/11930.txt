I've added testing of backup count and content for ISet and IList in my split-brain healing PR (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/11677). Those checks spuriously fail. I have not figured out, if this just happens in split-brain scenarios, when migrations happen (which is a part of the split-brain healing) or even in a normal cluster state.

For the `CustomMergePolicy` the error looks like:
```
java.lang.AssertionError: backupSet should contain 25 items [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] 
Expected :25
Actual   :15
```
The initial items `item0` to `item9` are missing, just the merged values `0` to `14` are there.

For the `PassThroughMergePolicy` the error looks like:
```
java.lang.AssertionError: set should contain 40 items [item2, item3, item4, item5, item8, item10, item11, item16, item17, item19, item20, item21, item22, item23, item24, item25, item26, item27, item28, item29, item30, item31, item32, item33, item34, item35, item36, item37, item38, item39] 
Expected :40
Actual   :30
```
Some of the initial items `item0` to `item9` are missing. Also some of the merged values `item10` to `item39` are missing.

The split-brain healing uses the same backup operation like the normal set operations.
