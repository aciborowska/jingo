Other than `com.hazelcast.map.impl.operation.RemoveOperation`, all other remove operations (`RemoveIfSameOperation`, `DeleteOperation`, `TryRemoveOperation`, `TxnDeleteOperation`) return boolean status, instead of oldValue. Since Removed event raised inside the RemoveOperation, if that result is not used, we can simply return boolen status as well, which is already there.
