__Given:__
Every write to map/cache generates invalidations and they have a partition-sequence numbers to track missing ones.

__Example scenario:__
Think of a scenario that invalidations are generated previously for some other near caches and then later a new near cached map is created. Currently it assumes partition-sequences are starting from 1 but it may not be the case since there can be previously created invalidations for other near caches for the same map before. So partition-sequence can be a bigger number than 1 when new near cached map starts. In this case, when first reconciliation task runs, it can mark all near cached entries as stale even they are not stale.(because, for instance, reconciliation has sequence number 99 for partition-1 but near cache side has 0 for the same partition and reconciliation thinks there are missing invalidations)

__Effect:__
In a similar scenario above, all near cached entries before first reconciliation period will be removed.
After first reconciliation period, there will be no such problem. Default time for reconciliation period is 60 seconds.
