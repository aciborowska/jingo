Hello,

I am using the last release of hazelcast API (3.2). 
I am trying to setup a TTL in the hazelcast.xml config file. This TTL is quite a long one (we want to keep data in memory for 6 months this means 15778800 seconds !).
During my tests, I am just using the default configuration file with the TTL above-mentioned and no entries are stored in the Map. 
What is the problem? I think my value is still lower than the theoritical limit (Integer.MAX_VALUE). I also experience this issue with the version 3.1.5.

Thanks in advance.
