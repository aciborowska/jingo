If a request is sent with the `POST` method and does not include a hazelcast session cookie (or other pre-existing `requestedSessionId`), WebFilter will currently call `getParameter(HAZELCAST_SESSION_COOKIE_NAME)`.  As per the [ServletRequest documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html#getParameter%28java.lang.String%29), `getParameter` and `getInputStream` can interfere with each other.

In my particular case, I'm seeing problems with HazelCast 3.3.1, Jetty 8.1.16.v20140903, and REST-style POST requests (which will never have a session).  I have `deferred-write` set to `true`.
