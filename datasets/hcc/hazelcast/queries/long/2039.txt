In Hazelcast 3.1.5, DistributedExecutorService.execute() increments the pending task count, but never decrements it on RejectedExecutionException. After my cluster recovers from an overload situation, I have seen local executor stats show queue size=0 and pending count=140071. This seems quite counter-intuitive to me. Is this behavior intentional? More in general, is local pending task count ever supposed to differ from local queue size, and if so how/why?
