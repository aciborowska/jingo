HZ 3.8-SNAPSHOT 

Jenkins nightly build
https://hazelcast-l337.ci.cloudbees.com/view/shutdown/job/shutdown-map-txn-1phase/

Is regularly failing Validation,

e.g fail msgs 

```
HzMember1HZ validate hz.txn.map.validate.TxnAssert threadId=0 global.AssertionException: atomic[txnMap1phase16=2133] != map[txnMap1phase.get(16)=2134] 
```

here we can see that txnMap1phase0  to txnMap1phase15  was ok

```
HzMember1HZ validate hz.txn.map.validate.TxnAssert threadId=0 global.AssertionException: atomic[txnMap1phase53 1992] != map[txnMap1phase.get(53) 1993] 
```

hear we can see that txnMap1phase0  to txnMap1phase52  was ok

The configuration for this test can be found 
https://github.com/Danny-Hazelcast/hzCmd-bench/tree/beta/lab/hz/shutdown/map-txn-1phase

The test code running is 
https://github.com/Danny-Hazelcast/hzCmd-bench/tree/beta/src/main/java/hz/txn/map/validate

I note that this function https://github.com/Danny-Hazelcast/hzCmd-bench/blob/beta/lab/hz/shutdown/map-txn-1phase/txn
we mush ignore some exception thrown during the run 

```
txn1@ignore=com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstanceNotActiveException:com.hazelcast.spi.exception.TargetDisconnectedException:java.lang.IllegalStateException
```

however all other test under the cluster member shutdown scenario do not need to catch such exceptions to complete https://github.com/Danny-Hazelcast/hzCmd-bench/tree/beta/lab/hz/shutdown
