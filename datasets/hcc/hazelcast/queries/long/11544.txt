`GivenKeysLoaderTask` prepares `Future`s of `PutFromLoadAll` operations which execute the actual batch loading. Once these futures are done, the record store is considered as loaded. However when a new member joins the cluster and partitions are being migrated to new owners these `Future`s are not known to the new owner and their tracking is lost to the new owner. Versions 3.8.7 & 3.9 will include a workaround ( #11529 , #11473 ).
