Hi, 

I'm working on 2 caches and their configurations are described below.
cache2 works fine and loads only 70 entries out of 166 entries available but cache1 loads 842 entries out of 988 entries however max-size defined is 100. It's showing some random behavior. If I change max-size to 20 then it loads around 759 entries out of 988. 

Please guide me about the possible problem.

Environment:
Spring 3.1.1
Hibernate
hazelcast version 3.4

Cache 1 configuration:

```
 <hz:map name="cache1"
                    backup-count="1"
                    max-size="100"
                    eviction-percentage="20"
                    eviction-policy="LRU"
                    time-to-live-seconds="1200"
                    read-backup-data="true"
                    merge-policy="com.hazelcast.map.merge.LatestUpdateMapMergePolicy"
            >
</hz:map>
```

Cache 2 configuration:

```
<hz:map name="cache2"
                    backup-count="1"
                    max-size="70"
                    eviction-percentage="20"
                    eviction-policy="LRU"
                    time-to-live-seconds="1200"
                    read-backup-data="true"
                    merge-policy="com.hazelcast.map.merge.LatestUpdateMapMergePolicy"> 
</hz:map>
```
