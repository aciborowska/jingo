2 problems:
1. If configuration is updated in mancenter then new nodes with new configuration cannot join cluster
2. if configuration is updated in mancenter and mancenter is shut down then nodes joining with old configuration will have different conf than existing nodes.

Tescase:
1.  Run 2 nodes with map.maxSize=200
2.  Change map.maxSize=2000 in mancenter
3.  Check the logs. It really is 2000
4.  Restart one node to have hardcoded map.maxSize=2000
**5.    Node cannot join the cluster**
6.  Start the node with map.maxSize=200. Everything is normal â€“ actual map.maxSize is still 2000
7.  Stop management console
8.  Restart one node so that map.maxSize=200
9.  Join succeeds but **old node has map.maxSize=2000 and restarted node has map.maxSize=200** which causes map to behave **incorrectly**: map held approx 1000 entries (not 200 and not 2000)
