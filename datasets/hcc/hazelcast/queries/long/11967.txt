`fail HzMember2HZAA reliable_id_check hzcmd.id.reliable.CheckId threadId=5 global.AssertionException: id_Check_split0 duplicate id found `

its making 1 cluster split, starting with a 5 node,  split into 3 and 2 and then joined back to 5

no membership changes when the clusters are split
no members added/removed to any of the subclusters
the subcultures should be stable

the test being run  https://github.com/hazelcast/hzCmd-bench/tree/81c74608f8ed55cdf3aa06bb8a325273a42fe1d1/lab/hz/split/id

the logs of the run are 
http://54.82.84.143/~jenkins/workspace/split-x1/3.10-SNAPSHOT/2017_12_12-11_36_24/id/

the script is under `go`, these are the ops being run

i also run a stable version of the test, 
and a kill -9 version, both did not see the duplicate ID issue
