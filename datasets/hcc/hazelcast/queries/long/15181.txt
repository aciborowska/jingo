Jet defines -302 for `Object[]` - https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/blob/master/hazelcast-jet-core/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/impl/serialization/SerializerHookConstants.java#L32

If a cluster is upgraded from an IMDG cluster to an IMDG + Jet cluster, then pure IMDG clients hit issues deserializing `Object[]`. This is the case for `MultiAttributeProjection`.

The simple answer is obviously to change the client from IMDG to IMDG + Jet, but this means retesting for the user.

```
Caused by: com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.HazelcastSerializationException: There is no suitable de-serializer for type -302. This exception is likely to be caused by differences in the serialization configuration between members or between clients and members.

I have a (large) reproducer if need be.
