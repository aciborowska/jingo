Client side distributed objects does not deregister client side listener registration, hence there is a possible leak at
```java
ClientListenerServiceImpl.registrations
```

ClientProxy.destroy should clean the listener related resource to prevent the leak.

Member side proxies remove the listener registrations after destroy called. A fix will provide a behaviour match too.
