Currently, `LoadAllTask`, used by loadAll operation on client/server side caches, doesn't call `CompletionListener::onException` if received error is a `Throwable` but not an `Exception`.

`javax.cache.integration.CompletionListener::onException(Exception e)` takes `Exception` not `Throwable` so if received error is not an `Exception` but `Throwable` (such as `Error`), it should be wrapped inside an `Exception` as `Throwable` is cause and can be passed to `CompletionListener`.
