From the heap dump of user, we saw events packets are piling up on client side. This user goes the oome before queue size reached. This can be avoided by configuration. I am opening the issue, since user saw another behaviour. Here is the explanation of test:

When users deregister listeners when killing client and the problem seems to have gone away. So here is the latest finding:

In both 3.5.1 and 3.5.4: 
1. have clients only implementing entryEvictedListener, not de-registering of listeners
2. start the client, start application operations and kill it after 10 mins
3. repeat step 2 for 4 - 5 times and this client goes in OOME after 10 - 15 mins of run.

In only 3.5.4, have clients de-registering listeners before they are shutdown and the problem does not occur. 
3.5.1 was not tested for this.

I could not reproduce the issue yet. This behaviour has seen on user test.
