We discussed a problematic scenario with @ahmetmircik . 
Putting here the scenario to verify the problem later. 

Let us have 5 members A B C D E (member list version 5)
1 . Assume that they split into two cluster as A-B-C(member list version 6) and D-E(member list version 6) 
2. Client was listening the member list from D. Client updates its local as "D-E(member list version 6)"
3. E left the cluster. Client updates the local member list as “D (member list version 7)”
4. D also shutdown. Client will search for a new connection. Client has all the members in its configurations. Lets say client has picked member A first. 
 5. It gets following memberlist from the member A "A-B-C(member list version 6)" .
Local member list was “D (member list version 7)”. 

Since member list version is smaller, it will not be applied. 
Client will not reset its current member list anywhere in this scenario. One possible point was when cluster id is different when client is switching from D to A. This will not help since both cluster have same cluster id in split brain situations. 

From this point, client will not be able to update the member list. Therefore, it will not open connections to B and C. 

A possible solution to investigate (suggested by @ahmetmircik ).
Can we reset member list version every time we register a cluster view listener back to cluster ?
