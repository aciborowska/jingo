Hi ,
We are using hazelcast v3.3 on standalone jboss 7.2.
The application works fine and then all of a sudden we start seeing the following exception.
The owner of the lock is shown as _dc639862-6273-4b41-a337-2c818bf310b3_, however we couldn't find reference to this ID even in thread dumps. The thread which get into this exception is the same _thread with id: 1009_, still it complains as not owner of lock.
Exception:
2014-10-27 21:29:23,977 10.4.204.41 (trafficScheduleImportJobsManager-244) ERROR **_[com.omn.common.msg.MessageFactory] {MsfMessaging} Error occurred while Releasing Lock on: queue/ScheduleImportJobs Owner:trafficScheduleImportJobsManager-244
