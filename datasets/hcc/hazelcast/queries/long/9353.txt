Running a simple test application with Hazelcast 3.7.3 and Spring Boot 1.4.2.RELEASE. The HazelcastRunner class is instantiated by SpringBoot using a configuration XML found in the classpath.  When building and running the application, we get the following error.
```java
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: 
Error creating bean with name 'hazelcastRunner' defined in class path resource [springConfigs/hazelcast/hazelcastRunner.xml]: 
Bean instantiation via constructor failed; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.BeanInstantiationException: 
Failed to instantiate [com.bmudda.hazelcast.docker.test.HazelcastRunner]: Constructor threw exception; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: PortableFactory[-22] is already registered!
