I've noticed that sometimes the same lock is obtained by two different threads each one in a different machine with a very small time difference.

Example from my logs:

2013-10-01 17:31:28,830 INFO [RMI TCP Connection(22)-10.65.13.15] c.c.e.i.r.l.DistributedHazelcastLock [DistributedHazelcastLock.java:59] Lock on 3109959898963880556 acquired
2013-10-01 17:31:28,848 INFO [RMI TCP Connection(44)-10.65.13.14] c.c.e.i.r.l.DistributedHazelcastLock [DistributedHazelcastLock.java:59] Lock on 3109959898963880556 acquired

I've experienced the same flakyness with IMap.putIfAbsent, where it returns null even though another thread just put a value on it.

Sadly, I'm unable to reproduce it in a local environment. I thought it might have something to do with lost UDP messages so I switched to TCP, and I still see the issue.
