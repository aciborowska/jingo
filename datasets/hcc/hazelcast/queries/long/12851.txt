
I see random fail in the split heal test's, https://hazelcast-l337.ci.cloudbees.com/view/split/

after some re run the test do pass.

looking at 
https://hazelcast-l337.ci.cloudbees.com/view/split/job/split-atomic-long/

I am looking in to the logs but I do not see why it should have lost the data.

after some split heal cycle we see
`fail HzMember2HZAA split_validate_qA hzcmd.atomic.ilong.Size threadId=0 global.AssertionException: atomicLongsplit_atomicA303 size 0 != expected 1`

which means the atomic long `atomicLongsplit_atomicA303` was lost out of the cluster.


i set longer setting for 
-Dhazelcast.max.no.heartbeat.seconds=120
-Dhazelcast.max.no.master.confirmation.seconds=250

but the next run https://hazelcast-l337.ci.cloudbees.com/view/split/job/split-atomic-long/27/console 

also lost an atomic long.

I don't know why it should happen that we lost structures out of the split cluster ?


essentially the tests all have the same format:

  start a 5 node cluster,

  load some data/structs into the cluster

  split the cluster into a 2 and 3 node cluster

  heal the cluster into a 5 node cluster 

  check for the data / structs

after a few split/heal cycles we lose the data/structs.
