```
    private <V> V waitOnFutureInterruptible(Future<V> future, long timeout, TimeUnit timeUnit)
            throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException, TimeoutException {

        isNotNull(timeUnit, "timeUnit");
        long deadline = Clock.currentTimeMillis() + timeUnit.toMillis(timeout);
```

deadline should not be set to the current time (in ms) plus the timeout as it would be a huge number (currently set to 1,468,533,720,000) and the handling of TimeoutException only decreases it a small amount at the time

```
            long localTimeoutMs = Math.min(MIN_WAIT_ON_FUTURE_TIMEOUT_MILLIS, deadline);
...
            } catch (TimeoutException t) {
                deadline -= localTimeoutMs;
```

IMO deadline should have been set to the timeout 

```
        long deadline = timeUnit.toMillis(timeout);
```
