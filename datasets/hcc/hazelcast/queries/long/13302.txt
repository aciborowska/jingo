At the startup of a node, before joining any cluster (or forming a cluster by its own), `http://localhost:5701/hazelcast/health` results in a healthy state like following: 

```
Hazelcast::NodeState=ACTIVE 
Hazelcast::ClusterState=ACTIVE 
Hazelcast::ClusterSafe=TRUE 
Hazelcast::MigrationQueueSize=0 
Hazelcast::ClusterSize=1
```

Since we haven't joined/formed any cluster, `Hazelcast::ClusterSize=1` is a wrong information. Since there is no cluster, `Hazelcast::ClusterSafe=TRUE ` is also wrong. 

This behaviour creates problems when health check is used by automated deployment tools. 

We should return something other than `HTTP 200` (possibly 503) and should not output any health information.
