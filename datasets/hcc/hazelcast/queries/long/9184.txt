I have a class named Game:

``` java
public class Game implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = -6321023979310869132L;
    private int id = 0;
}
```

and it's serializer

``` java
public class Game implements StreamSerializer<Game> {
  // read and write int
}
```

I've put to the map value: map.put("game", new Game(id = 1));

now I use: `java map.replace("game", new Game(id = 2));`

But when I use `java map.get("game")` after replace, I get: game.id = 0.

It's a bug or I'm wrong? Please show me.
