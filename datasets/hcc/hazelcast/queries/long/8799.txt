Flattening during parsing SQL predicate (introduced in https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8250) may result in erroneous predicate parsing. For example:

```
public class Record {
  private String str1,str2,str3;
  // getters & setters follow
}

Record r = new Record();
r.setStr1("ONE");
r.setStr2("TWO");
r.setStr3("THREE");
```

An `SQLPredicate` for predicate `"str1 = 'ONE' AND str2 = 'TWO' AND (str3 = 'THREE' OR str3 = 'three')"` will match object `r` in 3.6 but not in 3.7.
