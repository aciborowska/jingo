When a selector fails to be opened, the AbstractSelector doesn't throw an exception, but logs it and then continues. Then the AbstractSelector is started with a null selector and the run method will just spin around the following:

```
 int selectedKeyCount;
                try {
                    selectedKeyCount = selector.select(waitTime);
                } catch (Throwable e) {
                    logger.warning(e.toString());
                    continue;
                }
```
