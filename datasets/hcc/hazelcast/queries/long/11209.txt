#### Current behavior
Backups' view of the Ringbuffer differs from the primary's in case of an exception is thrown by the store underlying the Ringbuffer.

##### Example
Add 5 items.
A client adds a 6th.
The primary will add it to its ringbuffer. It will then call store. If the store throws an exception the primary leaves the 6th item in its primary ring buffer but does not add it to the backup ring buffer and it is also missing from the store.

#### Desired behavior
Neither primary nor backups add item(s) in case of a store exception is thrown. Store is responsible for not adding the item(s) in case it throws exceptions. 

Also the contracts between the Ringbuffer and the RingbufferStore needs to be documented in the javadoc.
