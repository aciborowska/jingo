This is not the first time I complain about predicate on date field, the last time was
http://code.google.com/p/hazelcast/issues/detail?id=747

I don't understand why the value needs to be converted from a String in AbstractPredicate.getRealObject(). The conversion has loss of precision because the date format does not have the millisecond part.

Worse, when the date field is indexed (with order), the hashcode returned from Index.getLongValue() is compared. It's simply wrong.
