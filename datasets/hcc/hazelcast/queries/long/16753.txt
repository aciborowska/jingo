I'm using hazelcast 3.12.2 version. As per the project requirement I have created three MapConfig's by providing MaxsizeConfig as 20% of FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE. In each Map I'm trying to cache 10MB,15MB,20MB files of 10 in number. My total heap space while  running application is 450MB.
As per the documentation if heap size reaches to 80% eviction will trigger as per the probabilistic algorithm defined with mentioned free heap percentage configuration,but its not happening.

  
**Describe the bug**
Eviction is not triggering with FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE policy

**Expected behavior**
Expected behavior is When 80% of the heap space is utilized eviction should trigger automatically.
**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Attaching the sample program and heap dump
