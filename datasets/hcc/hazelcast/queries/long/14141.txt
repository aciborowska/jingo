I'm upgrading to Hazelcast 3.11 and when tried to update Management Center to version 3.11, deployed as ROOT app in Tomcat, login page breaks due to a JS issue, in the following code:

    <script type="text/javascript">
      // we need to get the mancenter prefix from JAVA env somehow
      window.MANCENTER_URL_PREFIX =
        document.querySelector("meta[name='ctx']").getAttribute('content')
        // and we need to trim `/`, router configuration adds them when needed
          .replace(/^\/|\/$/g, '')
    </script>

The reason is that the meta tag has no "content" attribute in this scenario:
<meta name="ctx"/>
