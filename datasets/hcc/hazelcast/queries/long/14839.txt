When the hot restart is enabled on the members, members keep their uuid's.
But they can start with different addresses. 

The problem arises when a member comes back with the same uuid and different address. 
If the client gets disconnected and reconnects back, its internal state gets broken. Client wrongly keeps the old address in the member list. This will cause the client to report the wrong member list from the `client.getCluster().getMembers()` method,  fire wrong events. And also client operations will be affected.
