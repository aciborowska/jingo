When using native client (Hazelcast 3.1.3) to interact with Hz cluster, I noticed some JMX MBean attribute value (on Hz cluster node) is not set/updated. For example, the IMap localTotalGetLatency is always 0 even if the native client is making a lot of calls like HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig).getMap(someMap).get(someKey) -- even if you click Refresh button in the jconsole. I observed the same in the management center -- the Avg Get Lat. is always 0.

I just used Hz out of the box and didn't add any listeners. Is that an issue? Or did I miss anything?
Thanks!
