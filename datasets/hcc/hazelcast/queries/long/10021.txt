There is a race condition in TestClientRegistry where the tests are calling blockFrom and blockTo before any connection was made (via createSocketConnection) - thus causing a NPE in those block* methods.

The test should wait for the connection to become available before calling block* and unblock* methods (or the methods should somehow not rely on the existence of a connection).
