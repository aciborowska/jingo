Create a QueryCache on an IMap (which triggers the IMap creation).
Destroy the IMap.
Get the IMap by name again.
Get the QueryCache from the IMap.

HZ returns a seemingly valid QueryCache.

Update the IMap.

The update event never gets fired to the QueryCache.

I expect either the QueryCache to get the event, or the QueryCache should be destroyed when the 1st IMap is destroyed, and any attempts to retrieve it after that fact should result in a `null`
