When `readMapP` has a projection to an object that doesn't implement `equals`, the cooperative emission can fail with 
```
java.lang.AssertionError: Different item offered after previous call returned false: expected=[Ljava.lang.Object;@71e5cb0a, got=[Ljava.lang.Object;@75da41ee
```
I think it works correctly if assertions are disabled, though I did not test.
