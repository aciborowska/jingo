Found an interesting problem when running a cluster with only one node on version 2.1.x.

A client can literally remove all known address of any nodes in the cluster and just sit trying to connect but with no address of which to connect to.

Repo steps:
1. create cluster with one node.
2. configure client to connect to one node.
3. start client 
4. check client connected properly.
5. stop cluster.
6. check client connection lost and is trying to re-connect.
7. start cluster up again.
8. notice client wont re-connect as has remove from know list of nodes all addresses.

problem lies at: See https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast-client/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/client/ConnectionManager.java#L232

ive managed to replicate this with more than one node in a cluster for instance if you have a cluster with 6 nodes and for what ever reason 3 die then another 2. The client will switch to the remaining node all is fine however if the final node goes down before you manage to bring any of the other back up you are in the same situation where the client has removed all address from its address list.
