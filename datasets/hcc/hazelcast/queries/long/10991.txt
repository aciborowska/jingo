This is an example case which makes the issue in the title visible.


  as far as `distDestroy()` vs. `destroy()`  testing,  they both work in there own however when run consecutively, the second one fails, each time,  and only for IMap.     the https://hazelcast-l337.ci.cloudbees.com/view/stable/job/stable-x/99/console

could there be some duplication of invalidation messages ? in the case of destroy on IMap or some thing like this ?

i can not see why it should fail in such a strange way.



actually there seem to be 1 to 2 invalidations coming in in my `destroy()` tests
I've added some debug logs to the `Invalidator` and my invalidation listener (edited)
but sometimes the second invalidation isn't received:


that's a race between
```        
        nodeEngine.getEventService().deregisterAllListeners(SERVICE_NAME, mapName);
        mapNearCacheManager.destroyNearCache(mapName);
```
in `MapServiceContextImpl.destroyMap()`
