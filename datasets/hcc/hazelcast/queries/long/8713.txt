Hi,
I am using Hazelcast-3.5 with Spring. I am having cluster configuration for all the Hazelcast. I am using programmatic configuration as follows:

```java
Config config = new Config("dev_instance");
        config.getGroupConfig().setName("dev").setPassword("dev-password");
        config.setProperty("hazelcast.client.invocation.timeout.seconds", "40");
        config.setProperty("hazelcast.client.shuffle.member.list", "true");
        config.setProperty("hazelcast.health.monitoring.level", "SILENT");
        config.setProperty("hazelcast.socket.connect.timeout.seconds", "5");
        config.setProperty("hazelcast.socket.server.bind.any", "false");
        config.setProperty("hazelcast.socket.bind.any", "false");
        config.setProperty("hazelcast.version.check.enabled", "false");

        config.getNetworkConfig().setJoin(prepareJoinConfig(config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin()));
        config.getNetworkConfig().getInterfaces().setEnabled(true);
        config.getNetworkConfig().getInterfaces().addInterface("192.168.1.2");
        config.getNetworkConfig().getInterfaces().addInterface("192.168.1.3");
        config.getNetworkConfig().getInterfaces().addInterface("192.168.1.4");
        config.getNetworkConfig().getInterfaces().addInterface("192.168.1.5");
        config.getNetworkConfig().setPortAutoIncrement(true);
        config.getNetworkConfig().setPort("5701");
        config.getNetworkConfig().setPortCount(5);
        config.getNetworkConfig().addOutboundPortDefinition("5702-5707");
        config.getNetworkConfig().setReuseAddress(true);
        config.getTcpIpConfig().setEnabled(true);
        config.getTcpIpConfig().addMember("192.168.1.2");
        config.getTcpIpConfig().addMember("192.168.1.3");
        config.getTcpIpConfig().addMember("192.168.1.4");
        config.getTcpIpConfig().addMember("192.168.1.5");
        config.getMulticastConfig().setEnabled(false);
        config.getTcpIpConfig().setConnectionTimeoutSeconds(5);

MapConfig mapCacheConfig = new MapConfig("dev_instance").setAsyncBackupCount(0).setBackupCount(1)
                .setInMemoryFormat(InMemoryFormat.OBJECT).setEvictionPercentage(25)
    .setEvictionPolicy(EvictionPolicy.LRU).setTimeToLiveSeconds(TTLSeconds).setMaxIdleSeconds(TTLSeconds).setMergePolicy("com.hazelcast.map.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy");
config.addMapConfig(mapCacheConfig);
```

The same set of configuration deployed for every node. When I start the servers i am getting logs as follows:

Now when the application is in ideal state for 3-4 days it started throwing "Too many open files" error in Jboss. Although the Linux "uname" configuration is already increased and set to some standard value for all our UAT and PROD environments. Also, there are other projects too deployed on the same nodes and they don't use Hazelcast. Other projects don'e have this error.

Also when i try to check in linux uing open files command :

`lsof -p <pid> | wc -l
`
its values goes beyond 13K.

Also i can see lots of 

> "can't identify protocol"

(ie. nearly more than 100) in 

> lsof -p <pid>

 command. I came to know that hazelcast is constantly trying to open connections but not closing properly, As "can't identify protocol" shouldn't appear for that <pid> of Jboss.

If i disable Hazelcast from my application i don't see this errors.
Can u please suggest :
1. Whether any issue with my hazelcast configuration.
2. Please suggest how do i fine tune hazelcast settings in my PROD environment.
3. Also want to know whether i am getting error because Hazelcast not closing connection properly.

Please help me to narrow down the issue.
Thanks in advance.
