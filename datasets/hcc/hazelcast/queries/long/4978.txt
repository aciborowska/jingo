The cache manager may have been created as a part of the lifecyle of a Spring application context so it is desirable to actually shutdown the cache manager that was created as part of it.

Unfortunately, `HazelcastCacheManager` offers no way to access the underlying `HazelcastInstance`. Could you please add a getter (look at other cache manager implementations for reference).

Thanks!
