I'm currently using the dockerized version of payara-micro, 171.1 in ECS/AWS.

I have an issue which, as far as I can tell, spawns randomly. While using 3 nodes, 1 container / node, nearly each time I try to build my environment, 2/3 containers fail to join the hazelcast cluster throwing some exceptions.

To tackle this, I stop the the faulty containers from ECS and when the autoscaler brings them back, the exceptions are gone and the cluster forms with all 3 nodes correctly; but not in 100% of the cases. 

If you need the logs of the failing containers or the hazelcast config, feel free to ask since I try to solve this issue I'm having.

Thx.
