I am using version 3.3.3.
I have such configuration: 

> 
    <map name="GROUP.CORE.SESSION_REGISTRY.*">
      <time-to-live-seconds>0</time-to-live-seconds>
      <max-idle-seconds>0</max-idle-seconds>
      <eviction-policy>NONE</eviction-policy> </map>

and one more:

>    
      <map name="USER.*">
      <time-to-live-seconds>0</time-to-live-seconds>
      <max-idle-seconds>0</max-idle-seconds>
      <eviction-policy>NONE</eviction-policy>
     </map>


I do not need eviction, because application have full control under all maps and entries. And all unused/old entries will be deleted by application.
But I detect that some entries disapeared. Setting listener on problem maps I get such row in log:.

> 2016-11-18T18:10:15,166  | EntryEvent{entryEventType=EVICTED, member=Member [10.0.2.15]:5701, name='GROUP.CORE.SESSION_REGISTRY.SESSION_TO_USER', key=af45263f-0333-498c-a2ee-f209fe0f2474, oldValue=test-admin@testdev.org, value=null}

And I have a log of such rows in log about eviction.

Is it wildcards are not applicable, or config is wrong? Why hazelcast instance is using some eviction policy? Size of these maps are not big, less than 100.
Do I need to set some additional options to prevent eviction.
