Hi guys. I'm using hazelcast 3.9.2 and one of new features as 'Dynamically Adding Configuration'. My application has a module structure: there are several modules and core. Instance of the hazelcast is created by core, others modules are able to add some maps dinamically after that. Also i use spring 5.0.

here is sample of creating a map in a module:

```java
    @Bean
    public ReplicatedMap<String, Compilation> compilations(HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance) {
        ReplicatedMapConfig config = new ReplicatedMapConfig(COMPILATION_MAP);
        config.setInMemoryFormat(InMemoryFormat.OBJECT);
        config.setAsyncFillup(false);
        hazelcastInstance.getConfig().addReplicatedMapConfig(config);
        return hazelcastInstance.getReplicatedMap(COMPILATION_MAP);
    }
```

when i only start one node, all works perfectly, but when second node is started i get an exception on him:

```
Failed to instantiate [com.hazelcast.core.ReplicatedMap]: Factory method 'compilations' threw exception; nested exception is com.hazelcast.config.ConfigurationException: Cannot add a dynamic configuration 'ReplicatedMapConfig{name='compilation.map'', inMemoryFormat=OBJECT', concurrencyLevel=32, replicationDelayMillis=100, asyncFillup=false, statisticsEnabled=true, mergePolicy='com.hazelcast.replicatedmap.merge.PutIfAbsentMapMergePolicy'}' as there is already a conflicting configuration 'ReplicatedMapConfig{name='compilation.map'', inMemoryFormat=OBJECT', concurrencyLevel=32, replicationDelayMillis=100, asyncFillup=false, statisticsEnabled=true, mergePolicy='com.hazelcast.replicatedmap.merge.PutIfAbsentMapMergePolicy'}'
```

But both configs are equals into text of exception and you can see that.

Is it a bug or i do something wrong?
