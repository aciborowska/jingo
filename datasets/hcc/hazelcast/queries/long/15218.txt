When you lock a key that does not exist in IMap, that lock is not included into the `localLockedEntryCount` metric counter which available in JMX API for Maps.

The most simple way to reproduce this issue is to run the following code (tested with IMDG OS 3.12.1):
```java
Config config = new Config();
config.setProperty("hazelcast.jmx", "true");

HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
IMap map = hz.getMap("test-map");
map.put("foo", "bar");
map.lock("foo");
map.lock("baz");
System.out.println(map.isLocked("baz")); // prints "true"
```

Then you should check the `localLockedEntryCount` and the value will be `1`, while it should be `2`.

Most likely MultiMaps are also affected.
