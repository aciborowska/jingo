Doing a predicate query on an IMap that has indexes sometimes returns stale data, while retrieving a value with IMap.get(key) always returns the most current value.  Once a node begins returning stale data, it will always return that same stale value for all future queries.  The problem seems to be triggered by another node joining the cluster while a query is in progress.

We have seen this issue in Hazelcast 2.1.3 and 2.4.

I will attach code to demonstrate the issue in a comment to this issue.
