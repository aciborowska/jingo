Hi, We have encounter a problem same as a post at here:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hazelcast/TtkPvcgYdf8

here is the threaddump in our own case:

I found it easy to happen when:
network is not stable:
for example we connect to a vpn, the server is running, when disconnect from the vpn, the network will have a reset, in this case, it will happen.

when a node join/leave the cluster.
