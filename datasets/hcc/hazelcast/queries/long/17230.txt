Hazelcast requires opening some java modules for reflective access on newer Java versions as described in https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0.2/manual/html-single/index.html#running-in-modular-java

We don't provide the proper argument in our `start.*` scripts so users still see warnings.

Possible solutions:
* first detect the Java version and then use correct arguments;
* try to directly run Hazelcast with the "module" arguments first and if it fails, then fallback to the current set of arguments.
