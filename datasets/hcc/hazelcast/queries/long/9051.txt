If `DurableExecutorService.retrieveResult(long)` is run from a client for a task that doesn't exist, two exceptions appear on 3.7.1.

In the server logs `StaleTaskIdException`. This shouldn't be logged to the server if re-thrown to the client.

On the client, `ExecutionException`. This should be a `StaleTaskIdException`
