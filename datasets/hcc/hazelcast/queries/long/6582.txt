If 2 clients are listening on entryEvicted of EntryEvictedListener only, a map.put on one client results in a callback ClientMapProxy$ClientMapEventHandler.creteEntryEvent() on other clients, which further leads to deserialisation of the entry on those clients. This causes GC and excess CPU issues on the clients which are not even actively making map calls. 

It requires lazy deserialization on clients when the event arrives. This will prevent excess CPU and memory usage spikes.
