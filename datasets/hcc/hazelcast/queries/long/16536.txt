**Describe the bug**
NPE is thrown in `ManagementCenterService#getCPMembers` under conditions described here:
https://github.com/hazelcast/management-center/issues/2643

Looks like it was broken by this change: https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/da0e9c24d62949d6a799eb644c1db05534cfef82#diff-8a89e39d2dd4b72cf7e706e150947674R798

As far as I understand, the problem is that `#getCPMembers` returns CP member UUIDs, not AP member UUIDs. Automated tests didn't catch this regression as CP member gets the same UUID as its AP UUID when CP Subsystem starts initially (at least that's what I've seen).

**To Reproduce**

See: https://github.com/hazelcast/management-center/issues/2643

**Additional context**

This regression affects MC 4.0.
