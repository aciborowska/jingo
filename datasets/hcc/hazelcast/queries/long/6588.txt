I am using Map store for a map in Hazelcast.I am modifying an object inside the Map store.My map store also implements PostProcessingMapStore interface.

I create a client which does a Map.put to the cache.This put triggers the store on MapStore.I have a listener to the Map on client side also.When I try to do a map.get, I get the modified object back(because of PostProcessingMapStore) , but the entry added method inside the listener shows the unmodified object.Am I missing some configuration?
