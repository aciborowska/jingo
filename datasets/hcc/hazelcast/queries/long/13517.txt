From issue #13305:

```java
import com.hazelcast.config.Config;
import com.hazelcast.config.MapConfig;
import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;

public class Member {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Config config = new Config();
        HazelcastInstance member = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
        member.getMap("my-map").put("k1", "v1");

        // "my-map" already exists, updating its config should fail immediately !
        member.getConfig().addMapConfig(new MapConfig("my-map").setBackupCount(3));
    }
}
```

Above code should fail at the line `member.getConfig().addMapConfig(new MapConfig("my-map").setBackupCount(3))`.

Currently, this doesn't fail because `my-map` is created using the default configuration.
