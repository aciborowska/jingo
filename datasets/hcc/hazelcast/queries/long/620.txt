Hello,

We are trying to use the new near caching functionality for native clients (Hazelcast version 2.6). However this does not work. According to me this is because of following reason:

com.hazelcast.client.MapClientProxy (line 53):
MapConfig mapConfig = config.getMapConfig(name);

-> Always returns "generic" Map config, because in the name of the map, you have the client prefix added:

com.hazelcast.client.HazelcastClient (line 163):
return (IMap<K, V>) getClientProxy(Prefix.MAP + name);

Therefore, near caching never works...

Or are we doing something wrong?

Kind Regards,
