__Scenario:__
One 3.8 client is working with one 3.8 member. Then member is closed, 3.8 member jar is replaced with 3.7.4 member jar and member restarted. Client re-connects but listeners are not re-registered here: https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast-client/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/client/spi/impl/listener/ClientSmartListenerService.java#L136

__Maybe Solution:__
Compare members according to uuids instead of addresses here: https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast-client/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/client/spi/impl/listener/ClientSmartListenerService.java#L122
