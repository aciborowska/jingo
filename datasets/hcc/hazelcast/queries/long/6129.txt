This is 3.5.

The following code causes large spike in CPU usage (90%) as soon as connected with Hazelcast server.

void connect()
{
ClientConfig cf;
cf.getGroupConfig().setLicenceKey("licencekey");
Address addr("192.168.1.2,5701);
cf.addAddress(addr);
HazelcastClient *hc = new HazelcastClient(cf);
IMap<long, std::string>mymap = hc->getMap<long,std::string>("mapname");
}

Is there a bug that is causing high cpu or is there something else that needs to be configured?
