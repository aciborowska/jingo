hazelcast-all-3.5.2-SNAPSHOT version has a specific implementation to update a session id with HA prefix.

So, "<%= session.getId() %>" will return a session id like HZ0169EFFEC6FA4A76BB7061A241FA628D.

When we open tomcat manager/html/sessions, we cannot find a session with HZ prefix, because tomcat ManagerBase does not know anything about hazelcast session wrapper.

In this case not easy to understand what session is used by a client, what data is in the session.
Also not easy to monitor the created session, etc.
