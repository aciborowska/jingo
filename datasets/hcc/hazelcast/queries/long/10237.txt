Using service commons-daemon, in the stop() method.

Please help to me to understand how to force a shutdown of the connections and of the initialization.

After the shutdown of the service, this 2 threads are still running, no matter if you run shutdown, onShutdown, thread.interrupt(), thread.close(). 

       HazelcastInstanceFactory.terminateAll();
        hazelcasts.stream().map(instance -> (HazelcastClientInstanceImpl)instance).forEach(client -> {
            client.getConnectionManager().shutdown();
            for (ClientConnection connection : client.getConnectionManager().getActiveConnections()){
                connection.close("shutdown relay", new ShutdownChannelGroupException());
            }
            client.doShutdown();
        });
        hazelcasts.forEach(HazelcastInstance::shutdown);

Threads still up and running.
