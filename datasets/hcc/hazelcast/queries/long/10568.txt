Hi

Scenario is, we keep key 'sync_complete' in hazelcast. and we poll it once per minute. If key is present or we received any exception like connection not active etc, we dont do resync.  but If key is missing, indicates us that Hazelcast cluster restarted and we lost required data from that. So we trigger sync again.

Problem what we observe is sometimes even if key is present, we get None in return. We are using Hazelcast-Python-Client version 3.8.1. Say we miss value for 1 in 10000 iteration. but this is critical for us. 

To reproduce just poll for a key consistently in a loop. we have reproduced it consistently like this. sometimes it happences 1/10,000 and sometimes 1/100,000. This is kind of unpredictable for us.
In scale test beds which has 175k entries in a map, Its observed very frequently. 

When I tried to reproduce, I kept only one key in map. I am happy to provide more information on this. This is a release blocker for us for next release. 

with regards
