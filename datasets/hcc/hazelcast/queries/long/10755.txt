As is:
```
UNKNOWN.isLessThan(V3_9) -> true
Version.of(0, 1).isGreaterThan(UNKNOWN) -> true
```

Proposed amendment:
- `UNKNOWN` is only equal to itself
- `is(Less|Greater)Than` method with an `UNKNOWN` operand must return false
- `is(Less|Greater)OrEqual` with an `UNKNOWN` operand must return false, unless both operands are `UNKNOWN` -> `true`
- `UNKNOWN.isUnknown(Less|Greater)(Than|OrEqual)` must return true
- `otherVersion.isUnknown(Less|Greater)(Than|OrEqual)` with an `UNKNOWN` argument must return false.
