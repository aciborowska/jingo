Since client module was merged to core, the [default configuration of `BounceMemberRule`](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/87a0a348262a49cbd13454dbbf0a376b26329be4/hazelcast/src/test/java/com/hazelcast/test/bounce/BounceMemberRule.java#L466) executes tests with a client-side `HazelcastInstance` as test driver, unless a driver type is explicitly configured. Bouncing tests should be reviewed to ensure they are properly executed.
