We have run into a memory leak when using Hazelcast 2.5 for HTTP session clustering under Jetty 8.1.7.  We have narrowed it down to where we think it's in `com.hazelcast.web.WebFilter`.  We have created a program to demonstrate the leak available at https://gist.github.com/joe-temboo/5165698

Preliminary heap analysis shows more instances than might be expected of `com.hazelcast.nio.Data` and `com.hazelcast.impl.DefaultRecord`, although we're not sure if this might be a symptom rather than a cause.
