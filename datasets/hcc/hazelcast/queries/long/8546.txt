Scenario:
- a new  `Invocation` with `PollOperation` is created
- the `container` field [is set](https://github.com/jerrinot/hazelcast/blob/b66f2987c2904c5f0063576ca6013cdc1bc49a8b/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/collection/impl/queue/operations/QueueOperation.java#L65-L65) on the `PollOperation` instance - > `shouldWait()` returns true
- `PollOperation` is put into WaitNotify queue
- the partition is migrated -> the operation responds with `RetryableException`
- the invocation is retried -> it will use the same instance(!)  of the `PollOperation` -> it will use the previously set instance of the `container`. However the could already be destroyed/recreated.

All operations should follow this rule: "If there is a state then always set it eagerly. Do not use `if-null-then-set` idiom for operation state. "
