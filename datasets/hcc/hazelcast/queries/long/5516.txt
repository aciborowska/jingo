When the eviction policy of a distributed IMap is set to heap percentage with a threshold of 1%, MaxSizeChecker will invoke isEvictableHeapPercentage when determining whether to evict entries. getApproximateMaxSize will then be invoked with a maxSizeFromConfig argument of 1.

Because the return type of getApproximateMaxSize is an int, the expression:
`maxSizeFromConfig * EVICTION_START_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT`
will be cast from 0.95 to 0, such that:
`maxSize < (1D * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT * usedHeapSize / total)`
will always evaluate to true, and entries will always be evicted.
