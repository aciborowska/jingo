Since a predicate is reused on each node by all query threads thready-safety issues may arise in the following scenario.
- the user supplies a comparable to a predicate
- there's no guarantee if calling `equals` or `compareTo` is thread safe on the user supplied Comparable instance.
- in fact even in-built types like `Date` can be tricky since `java.util.Date.equals()` method is not thread-safe!

IMHO, In order to solve this issue it would be best to supply each query thread with a dedicated instance of the predicate. It will also allow caching of the converted values which was introduces in this PR #7589 (caching is already used in InPredicate though)
