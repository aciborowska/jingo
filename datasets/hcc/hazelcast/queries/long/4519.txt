I'm trying to run Hazelcast with Spring and Hiberante 4. The problem is that when I'm starting an application I get error: _org/hibernate/cache/QueryResultsRegion_. Probably the problem is that in _hazelcast-all-3.4_ is dependecy to _hazelcast-hibernate3-3.4_. Also with _hazelcast-spring-3.4_ there is the same problem, because it depends on _hazelcast-hibernate3-3.4_ (i.e. look at this [this example](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/blob/master/hazelcast-integration/spring-hibernate-2ndlevel-cache/pom.xml)).

So is there any way to integrate _Hazelcast 3.4_ + _Spring 3.2_ + _Hibernate 4.3.6_?
