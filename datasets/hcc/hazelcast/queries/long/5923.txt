https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/08857da91e497365437700243db026fda4c5c31a/hazelcast/src/test/java/com/hazelcast/xa/HazelcastXATest.java#L152  seems to have two operational modes:
- fast mode (<10s) 
- slow mode - (>2 minutes)

There is nothing in between. My guess is either our transaction recovery or the test itself is racy - sometimes a transaction is recovered successfully, but sometimes it's waiting for a timeout (2 minutes)
