In 2.0.2-ee, using a group name that contains a hyphen, e.g., "seat-yourself", will confuse the Management Center. It will treat the name as two separate tokens, "seat" and "yourself", and offer to let the Management Center user connect to one of these rather than the full name.

Workaround is simple: Don't use hyphens in hazelcast group names. But it would nice to have this limitation documented somewhere (or removed).

``` xml
<hazelcast xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config hazelcast-config-2.0.xsd"
           xmlns="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <group>
        <name>seat-yourself</name>
    </group>
    ...
</hazelcast>
```
