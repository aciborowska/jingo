Greetings.

I'm running the following example with a single node on both IMDG 3.11.1 and latest master and get different results. I know that the config is a bit weird, but I still would expect that the node should be able to start.
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Config config = new Config("hz1");
    config.getNetworkConfig()
          .setPublicAddress("127.0.0.2")
          .setPort(5701)
          .setPortAutoIncrement(false);
    config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin().getMulticastConfig().setEnabled(false);
    config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin().getTcpIpConfig().setEnabled(true)
          .setMembers(Arrays.asList("127.0.0.1:5701"));

    HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
    System.out.println(">>> Started!!! <<<");
}
```

For 3.11.1 the node is able to start, while for latest master it outputs the following to the console in an infinite loop and does not start:
```

I'm curious whether it's a known issue or just a change in the default behavior?
