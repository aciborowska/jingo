Some legacy code (of mine, not yours) is calling:

```
session.removeAttribute("blah");
// a few lines of code later...
session.setAttribute("blah", "my new blah attribute");
```

What happens is that since "blah" is marked for removal, at the end of the request "blah" will never be propagated to be "my new blah attribute".
