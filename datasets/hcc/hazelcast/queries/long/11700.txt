#### Issue reproduces in the following scenario
1) Consumer application uses Hazelcast client to call _take_ method on _IQueue_ and gets blocked, _IQueue_ is empty
2) Consumer application stopped, no items received
3) Up to 10 sec. delay
4) Consumer application starts again and calls _take_ method
5) Producer application calls Hazelcast client API to populate _IQueue_ with 5 items
6) Consumer application receives only 4 items, **1st one gets lost**

10 sec. delay here is related to a system property _hazelcast.client.endpoint.remove.delay.seconds_ which specifies a delay which triggers client connection removal if it's not alive.

We probably should track which operations were applied since the moment when connectivity problem arrived and roll back them if we detected that client is not alive longer than _hazelcast.client.endpoint.remove.delay.seconds_.
