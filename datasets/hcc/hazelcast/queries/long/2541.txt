Hi

We are seeing an issue with the ClientService in cases when the clients are running before the nodes are started.

We have tested this using Hazelcast 3.2.1 and 3.3-EA.

To reproduce: Start a single node and a number of clients - I have tested using between 2 and 5 clients. The problem does not happen every time, but the more clients you have running the more often it happens.

When the clients are running and connected, shut down the node and restart it. According to the clients they all reconnect to the Node (the CLIENT_CONNECTED event is fired) but the ClientService will not always notify you of the connected clients and ClientService.getConnectedClients() returns anywhere between 0 and the correct number of clients. If I look a bit deeper into it and look at ClientEngineImpl, the "endpoints" map contains the right number of endpints, but some of the clients have their firstConnection flag set to true, causing the ClientService to disregard it. When the firstConnection flag is set incorrectly, the ClientEndpoint.authenticated seems to be called twice, first with firstConnection=false, and shortly after with firstConnection=true.

I have created a small test project at https://github.com/lbakman/hazelcast_reconnect to reproduce it. run the assembly/target/module-client/_run.cmd to start a client and assembly/target/module-node/_run.cmd to start a Node.

The Node will write out when receiving ClientListenerEvents and will write out the number of connected clients using CluentService.getConnectedClients() every 2 seconds. You will see that the number of connected clients does not change over time even when the client count is incorrect.
