I noticed that MulticastJoiner can be much slower than configuration parameters imply.

See the code below (MulticastJoiner.calculateTryCount()).
tryCount is adjusted by a value which can increase significantly the time a node is waiting to decide if is a master or not. 

For example, even if I set multicast timeout seconds to 1, it still takes 8 seconds for a node to decide that is a master node. In my case tryCount is initially 10 and then adjusted by 65 to a total value of 75. So even if the MulsticastJoiner is configured to make a decision in one second, it still takes 8 seconds to do so.

This is especially painful in tests where 1 or 2 seconds would be just fine and running tests faster is important.

``` java
private int calculateTryCount() {
        final NetworkConfig networkConfig = config.getNetworkConfig();
        int timeoutSeconds = networkConfig.getJoin().getMulticastConfig().getMulticastTimeoutSeconds();
        int tryCountCoefficient = 1000 / PUBLISH_INTERVAL;
        int tryCount = timeoutSeconds * tryCountCoefficient;
        String host = node.getThisAddress().getHost();
        int lastDigits;
        try {
            lastDigits = Integer.parseInt(host.substring(host.lastIndexOf('.') + 1));
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            lastDigits = RandomPicker.getInt(512);
        }
        lastDigits = lastDigits % 100;
        int portDiff = node.getThisAddress().getPort() - networkConfig.getPort();
        tryCount += lastDigits + portDiff * timeoutSeconds * 3;
        return tryCount;
    }
```
