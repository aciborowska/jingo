Hi all!

We're using Hazelcast in enterprise application. It is Spring+Hibernate web application (deployed as .war into tomcat) It is application with only 2 nodes and no clients for now, but we are constantly experiencing cluster break up due to unknown reason.

OS: CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810
Java: 
openjdk version "1.8.0_212"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_212-b04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.212-b04, mixed mode)
Tomcat: apache-tomcat-9.0.21

Main usages of Hazelcast cluster in our application are following things:
1) Hibernate 2nd level distributed cache with a lot of entities (10k per map, several dozen maps)
2) extensive use of a distributed map lock like IMap.lock(%lock_name%), where lock name is typically a uuid

Application works almost fine, but sometimes the cluster is broken apart and nodes are not able to form new cluster without a restart. 

Below are logs from both nodes.

It looks like that there is time leap between two servers, but there actually isn't. Two servers are synchronizing their time using another server and time difference between them is in fact a serveral nanos.

But, we see another log that speaks about time leap:
`21:17:23 WARN [node_2] HikariPool:616 - HikariPool-1 - Thread starvation or clock leap detected (housekeeper delta=1m31s44ms835µs655ns).`

What reasons could cause such behavior?

We cannot reproduce this issue, it just occurs in our production environment sometimes. It can be days between this issue occurrence or even weeks.
