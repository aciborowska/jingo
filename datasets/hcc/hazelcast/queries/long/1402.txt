Version: Community edition 3.1.3

Using the same configuration as issue #1401 and a setup of a producer (Hazelcast client library), two consumers (using hazelcast client library) and two Hazelcast nodes (using TestApp with QueueStore configuration) .  If the first Hazelcast node is exited using the 'quit' command the producer throws an exception on offer( with timeout ).  The consumers stall then return null from the poll( with timeout).  The remaining running Hazelcast node has a queue size of zero.  Restarting the first Hazelcast node continues to show a queue size of zero.  After full restart the Queue size is correctly loaded from the database.

Logs from second Hazelcast node:

QueueStore - delete
