After destroying a proxy, accessing the map again implicitly creates a new map, but it looks like there are no proxies registered for the map. 

Either there should be an exception thrown when accessing a destroyed proxy or if it is accessed again, it should be re-registered in the ProxyService. The same issue occurs with a client side proxy as well.

```
   @Test
    public void testDistributedObjects() throws InterruptedException {
        HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = hazelcastFactory.newHazelcastInstance();
        IMap map = hazelcastInstance.getMap("map");
        assertEquals(1, hazelcastInstance.getDistributedObjects().size());

        map.destroy();
        assertEquals(0, hazelcastInstance.getDistributedObjects().size());

        map.put("foo", "bar");
        assertEquals("bar", map.get("foo"));
        assertEquals(1, hazelcastInstance.getDistributedObjects().size());
    }
```
