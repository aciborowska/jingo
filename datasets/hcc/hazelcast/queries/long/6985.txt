hazelcast 3.6-EA2
hibernate 3.6.10.Final

I use the hazelcast as 2nd level cache for hibernate. It is simple 2 members cluster - 
one embedded member in tomcat and one standalone member for asynchronous backup. 
The cache works fine alone in the embedded member only but when I start the standalone server 
it starts to fire exceptions java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.hibernate.cache.entry.CollectionCacheEntry.

I prefer the data would not be deserialized on server from binary format just like in 3.5.4 version.
I had to switch from 3.5.4 to 3.6 version because the cluster sometimes (very often) locked application in put operations.
