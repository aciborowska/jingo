On 3.10.5, PNCounter is not replicating using the default configuration

Steps to recreate
(1) start a member with no PNCounter or CRDT configuration
(2) create an increment some PNCounters from a client
(3) wait a few minutes to be sure `replication-period-millis` has passed
(4) start a 2nd member
(5) wait a few minutes to be sure `replication-period-millis` has passed
(6) kill the 1st member

PNCounters are lost.
