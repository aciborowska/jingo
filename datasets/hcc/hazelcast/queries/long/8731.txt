Hi,
I had develop a application about hazalcast. Unluckily, we found that the application will be hanged on about about 4 hours,
I found that something in the log.
2016-08-17 06:28:01,445 DEBUG [OperationService]: {hz._hzInstance_1_dev.InvocationMonitorThread} [1.1.1.4]:5701 [dev] [3.6.4] Invocations:62 timeouts:0 backup-timeouts:0
in every 4 hours, Invocations number is not normal, 
in the application, Invocation number is 1 to 0, but after  that time, i,e. it show 62, abnormal start. (some times may hanged, may core dump...)
So,what is the meaning of those 3 numbers?
