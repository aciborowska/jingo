Hi folks,
i saw this test here that checks for mapper exceptions:

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/dc11f99107733f73319b63b2c478e142ba449810/hazelcast-client/src/test/java/com/hazelcast/client/mapreduce/ClientMapReduceTest.java#L82

But when i go ahead and modify the wordcount sample like this:
https://github.com/codemomentum/hz-map-reduce/blob/master/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/example/mapreduce/TokenizerMapper.java

I do not get the mappers exception, instead the execution just hangs. Callback is not executed as well. The only exception i can get is a Timeout from the future. What am i missing here?
