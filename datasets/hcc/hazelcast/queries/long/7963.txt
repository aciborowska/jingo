Unlike the serverside InvocationFuture, the ClientInvocationFuture will immediately propagate the InterruptedException if the calling thread gets interrupted. This can be a problem with both caller and callee need to agree on the fact that the operation did or did not get executed.

e.g. a lock acquire operation where the caller is interrupted and therefor the caller believes that the lock wasn't acquired, but actually on the serverside the lock is acquired since on the server there is no knowledge regarding the client interrupt status.
