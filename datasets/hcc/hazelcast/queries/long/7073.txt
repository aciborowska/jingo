Hi,
I'm using HazelCast. And I had performance test with it.
But CPU usage of 1 node among the cluster, is too high.
And when I check it with AppDynamics, it looks like try publish event on `publishEvent` function.
Q1) What kind of data is published(all of our published messages? or some hazel cast data)
Q2) If it publish our own data, can we load-balance it with proper way?
