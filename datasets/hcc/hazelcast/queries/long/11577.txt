Since the hazelcast-spring.xsd is at https://hazelcast.com/schema/spring/hazelcast-spring-3.9.xsd but the namespace is http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring you can't get it to load. 

If you try to load it all with http you get:
```
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; systemId: http://hazelcast.com/schema/spring/hazelcast-spring-3.9.xsd; lineNumber: 2; columnNumber: 35; s4s-elt-character: Non-whitespace characters are not allowed in schema elements other than 'xs:appinfo' and 'xs:documentation'. Saw '301 Moved Permanently'.
```
If you try to load it all with https you get:
```
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; systemId: https://hazelcast.com/schema/spring/hazelcast-spring-3.9.xsd; lineNumber: 23; columnNumber: 47; TargetNamespace.1: Expecting namespace 'https://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring', but the target namespace of the schema document is 'http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring'.
```

If you try and mix them i.e.
       xmlns:hz="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring"
and 
       http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring https://hazelcast.com/schema/spring/hazelcast-spring-3.9.xsd

Then you get:
```
org.springframework.beans.factory.parsing.BeanDefinitionParsingException: Configuration problem: Unable to locate Spring NamespaceHandler for XML schema namespace [http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring]
```
