This did not get any traction for several months: 
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/hazelcast/Anatoly/hazelcast/-ZFsDuH5iOU/1uj9P7mK5bAJ so I'll convert it to an issue.
## problem
1. Node A is started
2. Node A caches data in some maps and a multimap with about 30 million entries (0 backups for everything)
3. Uses 27GB of heap. All good.
4. Node B is started
5. Node A starts "Remaining migration tasks in queue..."
6. Nodes A and B are very chatty (DEBUG) about:
   - "Applying replica sync for partition..."
   - "Scheduling [500ms] sync replica request to..."
   - "Started Migration : MigrationInfo{ partitionId=109, source=Ad..."
   - "Sending sync response to..."
7. Node B heap goes up: expected.
8. Node A (!) heap grows about 500MB a second until it reaches 40+GB and is killed by OS
### other details
- Node B does not write anything to the cluster
- All values are in protobuf (e.g. byte[] with the "same" hashcode/equals)
- nodes are clustered via tcp-ip:

``` xml
<tcp-ip enabled="true">
  <interface>node-a</interface>
  <interface>node-b</interface>
</tcp-ip>
```

P.S. Until this is resolved, or another solution is in place, we are running two nodes in their own "one node clusters" (e.g. localhost), which of course is not what the system was originally designed for, since all the distributed (data reuse) benefits are not there: e.g. a "could just use a HashMap/Guava multimap" situation.
