Currently, JMX beans might be registered at an arbitrary time from virtually any thread, and registration is not synchronized with the instance lifecycle. See `JmxPublisher.createMBeanFunction` and it's callers. As a result, some JMX beans may remain registered after members stop. We observe it through random failures from the `JmxLeakHelper.checkJmxBeans` method, which ensures that there are no dangling JMX beans after the test is done. 

We need to review our JMX infrastructure and make sure that beans registration is always synchronized with owning instance lifecycle so that no beans are ever registered after instance shutdown.

As a part of this ticket, please re-enable the method `JmxLeakHelper.checkJmxBeans`.
