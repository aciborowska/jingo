Hi,
What changes do I have to make to the ldap-person example run in openLDAP instead of ApacheDS?
thank you,
Julio Cesar

Basically it should be sufficient to comment the line in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml which imports apacheDsContext.xml and edit ldap.properties in the same directory to point to the appropriate server.
Some data is expected to be present in the target LDAP server, defined in src/main/java/setup_data.ldif.

Yeah, I´ve done exactly that, but it didn´t worked. It gives me "Bad credential" error. My steps:
1. Comment import(apacheDS)
2. Populate openLDAP with base_data.ldif and setup_data.ldif
3. Replace user(cn=Manager) and password(secret).
4. Run...
5. "Bad Credentials"

Ah, right, you'll need to change in applicationContext-acegi-security.xml to run against your OpenLDAP server as well (in ContextFactory definition). That's nasty - it should be taken from the properties file. Might I ask you to post a Jira issue so we don't lose track of that problem.
