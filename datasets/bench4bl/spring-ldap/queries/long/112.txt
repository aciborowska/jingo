Issue LDAP-91 was opened to address spaces in a DN
The solution provided does not match up with RFC 4514, according to section 2.1:
"The encodings of adjoining RelativeDistinguishedNames are separated by a comma (',' U+002C) character."
And then section 3:
"Implementations MAY recognize other DN string representations. However, as there is no requirement that alternative DN string representations be recognized (and, if so, how), implementations SHOULD only generate DN strings in accordance with Section 2 of this document."
Also see all the examples in section 4.
Based on the RFC, spring-ldap should be able to parse DN string representations delimited by both command and space (or other whitespace characters, etc) but should only generate DN strings separated by commas.
While I agree that the version with spaces is more readable, the fact is that all LDAP servers are not required to recognize that as a DN string. Since spring-ldap writes the DN to the directory with spaces (e.g. uniquemember attributes using DNs) this needs to be changed.
I like the format method that was added for 1.2.2 which allows both COMPACT and NON_COMPACT representations, however, the default should be COMPACT.
