Apparently "apacheds-all" shades all its dependencies, so there is a nasty potential for conflict if you include it transitively with application code. See here for examples of side effects with an old version of slf4j: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22817959/deploying-springboot-to-standalone-glassfish-tomcat-renders-the-incompatible-slf. I'm not really sure what the best course is, but re-declaring the dependencies in Spring LDAP might help prevent other users from stumbling into similar problems.
