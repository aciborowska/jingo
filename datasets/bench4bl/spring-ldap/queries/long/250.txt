Including log4.properties in a library means that it may override an application's own settings (always in the case where an application uses log4j.xml for configuration, and at the classloader's whim when the application uses log4.properties).
This is a particular issue since the version packaged with this library restricts Spring logging to ERROR.
The only way to completely work-around this error is to rebuild the library JAR without the file, and save in a local repository.
