Firstly thanks for this great framework.
Reading the .pdf upgrade guide
#1 missing and. 
The transaction support is entirely new should not affect users of previous releases.
I think it should be "is entirely new and should not ..."
#2 use of described instead of documented (typical scandinavian)
To sort it out, some major restructuring was needed, as
described in the following sections.
I think it should be ",as documented in the following sections"
#3 ctrl
(such as "Ctr+Shift-O" in Eclipse)
Should it not be "ctrl+shift+0". 
#4 courier font
The table in 1.1 could use courier font so its more code like.
