Hello 
We have a remote service utilizing Spring-Ldap. We'd like to be able to return exceptions to the service caller, however they're not Serializable 
Perhaps it is the wrapped NamingException that is not Serializable. My preference is for the exceptions to be serializable (perhaps there are other points of view), therefore I'd suggest to wrap the stack trace and message from NamingException and discard the non-Serializable part. 
Regards, 
Jasper
