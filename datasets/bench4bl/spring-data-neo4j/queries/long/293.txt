This repository method works:
Item findByLayersNameAndHash(String layerName, String hash);
This repository method fails:
Item findByLayersNodeIdAndHash(Long layerId, String hash);
I have attached a sample project that demonstrates this.  Run the ItemRepositoryTest.  The first test succeeds and the second one fails.  As they both are finding an object by a referenced objects field value, and a 'local' field value, they both should work.
