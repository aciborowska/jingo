The ogm test harness module is not marked as a test scoped dependency . As a result, the released SDN modules pull in a transitive dependency to a test harness jar that can't be resolved, because the test harness is not part of the release train.
This does not result in unbuildable projects using SDN because the test-harness code is never called from the core product, but it does mean that mvn dependency:list shows unresolvable dependencies.
