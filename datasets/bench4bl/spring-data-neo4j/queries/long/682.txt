In SDN3 it was possible to pass an object in to a repository and the framework would use it's GraphID as an argument to a query. This no longer works and the caller has to provide the key to use.
This example works in SDN3 - the framework extracts the ID to use as the argument






    @Query(




            value = "MATCH (lhs:SomeNode) -[]->(rhs:OtherNode)"+




                    "        where id(lhs)={0} " +




                    "       return rhs")




    Set<OtherNode> findSomeNodes(SomeNode node);






Application method signature has to be altered to work with SDN4 






    Set<OtherNode> findSomeNodes(Long node);






This should be either fixed or documented. DATAGRAPH-656
