The findAll() methods of CRUDRepository don't support paging and sorting as stated in the javadocs. The existence these methods confuses users and is very likely to cause bugs. Could these behaviors be implemented? Or as an alternative, should they be deprecated as they don't offer what they imply?
I'm willing to do a PR for this, but I'll need some initial help from the core team.
