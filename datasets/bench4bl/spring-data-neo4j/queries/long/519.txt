Example 41. Cypher - Friend Recommendation on Repository






	start user=node({0})




	match user-[r:RATED]->movie<-[r2:RATED]-likeminded,




	  user-[:FRIEND]-friend




	where r.stars > 3 and r2.stars >= 3




	return likeminded




	order by count(*) desc




	limit 10






I am new to Cypher query, so correct me if I am wrong.
If we want to find users that like movies that we like and are not our friends yet, then query should be something like this:






	start user=node({0})




	match user-[r:RATED]->movie<-[r2:RATED]-likeminded




	optional match user-[f:FRIEND]-likeminded




	where r.stars > 3 and r2.stars >= 3 and f is null




	return likeminded




	order by count(*) desc




	limit 10
