I'm using SDN in the advanced mapping mode. Everything is working fine, except validation in a RelationshipEntity. It looks like this:






@RelationshipEntity(type = Vote.TYPE)




public class Vote extends Entity {




    




    public static final String TYPE = "LIKES";




 




    @StartNode




    private Person person;




 




    @EndNode




    private Post post;




 




    @Min(0)




    @Max(5)




    private int score;




 




...




}






When I create a relationship between two nodes with an invalid score, the validation isn't triggered. An example:






final Person john = new Person("John", "Doe").persist();




final Post post = new Post("SDN Example", "Description").persist();




new Vote(john, post, 20).persist();






For the record, validation works in the Person and Post NodeEntities. See reference URL above for the entire test project.
