Assume a node entity with a relationship defined as:






    @Relationship(type = "OWNS", direction = Relationship.INCOMING)




    private CompanyNode company;






When persisted, the relationship name is set to "COMPANY", not "OWNS" as specified by the type. The relationship direction is also ignored.
The only way to have an OWNS relationship is to change the variable name.
Type, if supplied, should override the property name
