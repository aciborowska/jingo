I have a partial node with a boolean instance variable that is stored in the relational DB.  When I attach the node after persistence, I always get a ConcurrentModificationException on the boolean property because call to retrieve the old value in DetachableEntityStateAccessors.checkConcurrentModification() returns null if there is no accessor for the field.  This null value doesn't match the new boolean value and I get the CME.  Attached patch is a hack, but may help illustrate the issue.
