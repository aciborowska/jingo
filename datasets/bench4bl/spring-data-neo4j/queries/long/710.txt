Neo4jTemplate is the only class that fires events around Session.save/delete etc.  However GraphRepositoryImpl, which is the implementation for what almost all repositories use, does not use Neo4jTemplate, nor does it fire its own events.  So as of right now the event lifecycle for repositories is missing.
