See the attached github issue reported against the getting started guide. It complains that "expected parameter 0", when @Param("name") is clearly defined.
NOTE: This same custom finder is in the JPA and MongoDB versions of this guide and work just fine. So something specific to Neo4j's back end must be wrong.
