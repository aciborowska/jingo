I'm using Spring Data Mongo together with Spring Data Neo4j in my project.
And now I had to use Neo4jConfiguration.setBasePackage(String...), but there's a small annoying "bug":
It scans for AnnotationTypeFilter(Persistent.class)
And Mongo's @Document annotation is also annotated with @Persistent. So I can't scan my whole classpath for Neo4j Entites, because it also finds all Mongo Entites, and then (of course) complains that it can't use them with Neo4j.
Wouldn't it be enough to just scan for @NodeEntity and @RelationshipEntity?
