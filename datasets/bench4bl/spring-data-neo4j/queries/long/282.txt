I ran into some weird issue when I test my code involving Neo4j with JMeter. I use Neo4j 1.7 and Spring Data Neo4j 2.1.0.RC1. I have a very simple example:
I have one node of type User, one node of type Car, and one relationship of type Loves. I have a repository for Car (GraphRepository<Car>). Here is my query:
@Query("start user=node:User(name=
{name}
) match user-[:Loves]->car return car limit 1")
public Car getSingleCar(@Param("name") String name);
In my db, I only have one user, one car, and one loves that connect the user and the car.
I spawn off 100 threads in JMeter to invoke this method, vast majority of the time, I got the car back. BUT, occasionally, I got "null" back as if no car is found.
When I reduce the thread down to 1 and run continuously, I did not see this problem. Every time, I got the car back.
First I tried this with Neo4j 1.7 and SDN 2.1.0.RC1. I also tried with Neo4j 1.8.M06 and SDN 2.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT. Same behavior.
