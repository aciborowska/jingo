Ran into an issue running a test that used EntityManager to persist something, because the EntityManager obtained by injection of @PersistenceContext in my test was no longer the same one passed into the constructor of PartialNeo4jEntityInstantiator. Attached patch to remove the constructor arg and use @Configurable and @PersistenceContext on PartialNeo4jEntityInstantiator got me past the issue.
