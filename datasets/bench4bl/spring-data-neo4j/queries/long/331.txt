I'm using the advanced mapping mode where by default all fields of an entity are persisted to the graph. When a property can't be persisted due to its type not being supported by the conversion service, an info message is logged:






INFO  o.s.d.n.f.DelegatingFieldAccessorFactory - No FieldAccessor configured for field: class org.joda.time.DateTime modifiedDate rel: false idx: false






I was wondering why this isn't a warning. I had some trouble around this area, but ignored the message the first time around due to its level. 
IMHO it should be a warning, as some data will simply be not persisted and thereby lost, which is not the expected behaviour. If it is intended not to persist a field, this intend should be made clear by declaring it transient.
