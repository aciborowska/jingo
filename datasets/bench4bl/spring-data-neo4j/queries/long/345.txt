Spring Data Commons will introduce support for countâ€¦By projections for derived query methods in repositories. PartTree now has an isCountProjection() method. Spring Data JPA (DATAJPA-231) and MongoDB (DATAMONGO-636) already implemented this feature so it would be cool if we added this capability to Spring Data Neo4j as well.
