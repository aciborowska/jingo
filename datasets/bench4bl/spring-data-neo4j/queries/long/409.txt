Default transaction configuration for repositories is currently handled by CRUDRepository which has a few drawbacks:

Users extending one of the more general base interfaces will not get transactional behavior
The declaration of delete(Long id) is missing so that these calls do not run inside a transaction by default.

We should rather move the default transaction handling to AbstractGraphRepository.
