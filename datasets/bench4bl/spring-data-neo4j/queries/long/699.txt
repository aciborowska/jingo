Hi maintainers,
I have upgraded from SDN 3.0.1 to SDN 3.3.1 and seems that the possibility to add properties to relationship is broken ?! Or did I miss something ? 
This entity was working properly before, but now I can see that when it is persisted, the createdDate and uuid are not saved anymore.






@RelationshipEntity




abstract class MyRootRelationship implements Serializable {




 




    // internal id for Neo4J




    @GraphId




    Long id




 




    // exposed API id




    @Indexed(unique = true)




    Long uuid = Math.abs(UUID.randomUUID().getMostSignificantBits())




 




    @Indexed(indexType = IndexType.SIMPLE, indexName = MyIndexNames.RELATIONSHIP_CREATED_DATE)




    Date createdDate = new Date()




 




}






Did something change or is it really a bug ? I have almost the same entity for Node and it's working correctly.
