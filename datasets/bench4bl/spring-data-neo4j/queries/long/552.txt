Given the classic film critic example:
User critic...
Movie film...
Rating rating = critic.rate(film, ...);
...where Rating is an @RelationshipEntity, the following code should retrieve the Rating that matches the specified relationship ID.
Rating loadedRating = ogmSession.load(Rating.class, ratingId);
However, the Session.load(...) code currently assumes that it's always going to be looking for a node entity and therefore isn't matching the ID correctly.
