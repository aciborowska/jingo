When doing something like
@Query("MATCH (d:Document)[:REL](o:Other) "
            + "RETURN  id(o) as docuid")
public List<RandomResultDomainWithId> getXXXXX();
@QueryResult
public class RandomResultDomainWithId 
{

    @ResultColumn("docuid")
    public int docuid;

}
I need to declare the variable docuid as int. Shouldn't that be long as the @GraphId is a long too?
