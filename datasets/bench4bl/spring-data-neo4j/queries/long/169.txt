We have a Gender Class annotated with @NodeEntity and a GenderRepository. 
When we do a findByPropertyValue("description", Gender.FEMALE) it works just fine, but if we do Iterable<Gender> gender = genderRepository.findByDescription(Gender.MALE) we get the exception:
"org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException: Error executing statement start gender=node:gender-description(
{0}
) return gender; nested exception is org.neo4j.cypher.SyntaxException: `(' expected but `-' found"
Unfortunately, this error message does not help us track down what broke, and whether it was our fault or SD's.
