In class RelatedToViaCollectionFieldAccessorFactory at line 103ff. you can find the method below:






protected Map<Node, Object> loadEndNodeToRelationshipEntityMapping(Object newVal, Node startNode) {




    if (!(newVal instanceof Set)) {




        throw new IllegalArgumentException("New value must be at least an Iterable, was: " + newVal.getClass());




    }




    return relationshipEntities.loadEndNodeToRelationshipEntityMapping(startNode, (Iterable<Object>) newVal, relatedType);




}






This cases that only Sets are allowed as Relationship, thus List for example will be rejected!
Please change the condition to if (!(newVal instanceof Iterable)) ...
