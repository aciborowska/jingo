ManagedFieldAccessorSet.update() calls fieldAccessor.setValue(entity, value) with the updated set, and it is performed when the ManagedFieldAccessorSet is updated. The only FieldAccessor that is ever used here is the OneToNRelationshipFieldAccessor. Possibly ManagedFieldAccessorSet could be made specific to that FieldAccessor and utilize a method for only setting?
