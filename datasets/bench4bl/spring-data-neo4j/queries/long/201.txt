Wrong results when using "findByPropOneAndPropTwo" in GraphRepository where propOne and propTwo both have @Indexed
Case 1
Without @Indexed on both fields, the result is correct
Case 2
With only one field having @Indexed, the result is correct
Case 3
When both have @Indexed, I found that the resulting cypher becomes
"start node=someindex(...), node=someindex(...)"
The result is not the output from a "And" operation in Case 1 and Case 2.
