Sub project spring-data-neo4j4-demo is a port of spring-data-neo4j-demo.
I changed the annotations to the new OGM annotations.
UserRepository.findByUserId doesn't find a user.
AuditEntryRepository.findByAuditTypeAndAuditTimeGreaterThanAndAuditTimeLessThanOrderByAuditTimeDesc
leaves one date as text but translates second date to long.
LocationUpdateRepository.findByDeviceAndLocTimeGreaterThanAndLocTimeLessThan
leaves one date as text but translates second date to long.
This works in the Neo4j 3.x sub project.
Executing the following will reproduce the problem:






gradlew -Dtest.neo4j.bugs=true :spring-data-neo4j4-demo:check
