I recently found an issue where when using Java 8 parallelStream() to concurrently manage internal DB objects Vs graph objects, that the API would return back a different graph object than the one requested. If I change to use stream() instead then it is working correctly. 
I have attached a sample code to recreate it. To run this you just need to set your graph details in com.crowdmobile.test.Neo4JConfiguration and then run as a spring boot app. In class Neo4JTestService you can see domains.parallelStream() call and if you run this once it will show that each domain object has been updated once which is correct. If you run it again you will see that it is not consistent what is updated. If you change this to stream(), then it will correctly update each by one each time.
