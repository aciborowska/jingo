The spring data neo4j and spring-data-neo4j-aspects Maven poms depend on slf4j-log4j and log4j as scope=compile, which makes it transitive.
It should:
1. depend on slf4j-api
2. either:
   a. make slf4j-log4j and log4j dependencies as optional=true
   b. make  slf4j-log4j and log4j dependencies as scope=provided
As workaround I exclude those dependencies in my project but this should not be needed.
Thank you.
