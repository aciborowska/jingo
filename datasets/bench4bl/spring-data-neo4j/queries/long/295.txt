When using a RepositoryImpl and a Service both autowiring in the Repository, creation of the spring context fails with a NullPointerException. I've followed the instructions in the documentation for composing repositories.
I have attached a small test case that simply tries to instantiate an ApplicationContext, which triggers the exception.
If I remove the @Autowire annotation from either PersonRepositoryImpl or PersonService the problem goes away.
The test case uses java configuration but it is possible to recreate the error using an xml configuration too.
