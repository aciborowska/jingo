I was experimenting with the spring-data-neo4j-4 to see what was possible. For a particular undirected relationship I set the getter method's return type to a generic like so <? extends SomeCommonParentClass>
this caused the subString() call inside the method:  
(line:50) org.neo4j.ogm.metadata.ClassUtils.getType(String descriptor)  
to throw an ugly StringIndexOutOfBoundsException 
because: when using generics as the return type of a the getter method the parsed descriptor string arg begins with a '+' like ("+Lcom/my/class") and NOT ("Lcom/my/class")
Now I am not requesting to allow generics to be used in relationships but this scenario threw an ugly StringIndexOutOfBoundsException because no logic was written to handle the descriptor string beginning with a "+". So it took me a while to troubleshoot and figure out what actual issue was... and I think this fix is a trivial one to avoid the ugly StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.
