spring-neo4j-2.0.xsd does not validate anymore. Eclipse raises the following error:

The errors below were detected when validating the file "spring-neo4j-2.0.xsd" via the file "module-context.xml".  In most cases these errors can be detected by validating "spring-neo4j-2.0.xsd" directly.  However it is possible that errors will only occur when spring-neo4j-2.0.xsd is validated in the context of module-context.xml.
src-resolve: Cannot resolve the name 'repository:repository' to a 'type definition' component. line 32.

The referenced schema file for the namespace "repository" (see here) has changed. spring-repository.xsd now seems to be the same as spring-repository-1.4.xsd. This version 1.4 does indeed not contain the "repository" type anymore that was present in version 1.0.
spring-neo4j-2.0.xsd should point explicitly to the versioned schema location http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/repository/spring-repository-1.0.xsd for the repository namespace.
