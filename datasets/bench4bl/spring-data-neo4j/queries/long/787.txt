If a derived finder is defined in this manner:






public interface CrudGraphRepository<T extends Entity> extends GraphRepository<T> {




    T findById(String id);




}




 




public interface UserRepository extends CrudGraphRepository<User> {




 




}







UserRepository.findById assumes that the return type is Entity and the label to match is also based on Entity. It should be User instead.
Workaround: override the derived finder in UserRepository.
