I have a fulltext index called nodefull.
I have a NodeEntity of type Example with a property called name:
@NodeEntity
public class Example {
    @Indexed(indexname = "nodefull", fulltext = true)
    private String name;
}
I'm using a repository to query the data over the REST API:
@Repository
public interface ExampleRepository extends GraphRepository<Example>, NamedIndexRepository<Example> {
}
I'm using the findByPropertyValue() method on the repository:
exampleRepository.findByPropertyValue("nodefull", "name", "Some value");
The RESTful query that gets generated is:
index/node/nodefull/name?query=Some%20Value
This is not a valid REST API call as far as I can tell, and is returning null results.
The correct query would be either:
index/node/nodefull/name/Some%20Value
or
index/node/nodefull?query=name:Some%20Value
as far as I can tell.
The bug appears to be in the org.springframework.data.neo4j.rest.index.RestIndex class and its public IndexHits<T> query( String key, Object value ) method (first two lines).
