I'm trying to send a mapped Neo4j query result object (a @MapResult Interface, proxied by QueryResultProxy) over to another JVM using Spring Remoting. Seems the QueryResultProxy object graph is not Serializable. I'm not really sure how the QueryResultProxy works - but I think Spring AOP proxies are serializable. Should the QueryResultProxy be Serializable?
