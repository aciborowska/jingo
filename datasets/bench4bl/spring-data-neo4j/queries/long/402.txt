As of the M4 milestone of Neo4J 2.0, it is mandatory to execute all database operations from within a transaction; previously, Neo recommended using transactions for reads, but this was optional. Now attempting a read outside a transaction throws NotInTransactionException.
The Neo4jTemplate can't even construct with the current milestones, because DelegatingGraphDatabase:132 attempts to read index information outside of a transaction, and there are probably a number of other instances of non-transactional reads.
This is a blocker for any use with Neo4J 2.0.
