I have a node entity that has a String property which holds an email address. 
E.g.:
@NodeEntity
public class AccountEntity extends BaseEntity
{
	/**

User name of this account
	 */
	@Indexed(unique = true)
	private String userid = null;
...
}

and a repository interface with a derived finder:
public interface AccountRepository extends GraphRepository<AccountEntity>
{
	AccountEntity findByUserid(String userid); 
}
However if the value for userid is something like: test@t-online.de
it will always return null. The derived finder has an issue with the dash character and/or the "." character.
