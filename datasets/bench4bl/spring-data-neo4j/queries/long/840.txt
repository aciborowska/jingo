I have a Set<Long> (no @Relationship) in a @NodeEntity class. When it is persisted somehow the Long is getting converted to Integer. I have to reload this class and populate other classes(not @NodeEntity) with values from this class. I use reflection to get fields from @NodeEntity class to find fields in other class and populate those fields. In doing so the code tries to populate Set<Integer> to Set<Long> and I get a ClassCastException. This has become a huge roadblock for me. Any help would be appreciated. I could not find anything related to this in the internet.
