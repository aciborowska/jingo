When I use: User user = template.findOne(id,User.class)
if a an id is provided that doesn't belong to a node representing a user but a to a different class (e.g car) the method returns a not null result. 
More specifically it returns a user objecthaving all its fields filled with null.
Shouldn't this throw a casting error ? (form car to user?).
Both User and Car nodes have a property named _type_ (with values my.domain.User and my.domain.Car respectively)
