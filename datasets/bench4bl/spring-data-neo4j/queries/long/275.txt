Autowiring an SDN GraphRepository<T> using SDN-REST fails when the remote graph has zero nodes.
It looks like a call to retrieve the reference node returns a null object which causes an exception to be thrown.
If the remote graph has no node with id=0, but has other nodes, this does not fail.
Detailed build log attached.
