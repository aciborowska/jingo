In the current version CSVFormat#withHeader is only used by CSVParser. It would be nice if CSVPrinter also supported it. Ideally, the following line of code



CSVPrinter csvPrinter

  = CSVFormat.TDF

    .withHeader("x")

    .print(Files.newBufferedWriter(Paths.get("data.csv")));

csvPrinter.printRecord(42);

csvPrinter.close();



should produce



x

42



If you're alright with the idea of automatically inserting headers, I can attach a patch.
