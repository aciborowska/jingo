CSVLexer.nextToken carefully saves leading whitespace in wsBuf if leadingSpacesIgnored is true.
Later on, if leadingSpacesIgnored is false, it adds the contents of wsBuf to the token content field.
It's not entirely clear what this was intended to do, but at present it achieves nothing; tests pass without it.
