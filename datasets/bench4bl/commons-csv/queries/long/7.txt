If you are parsing a stream (for example stdin) and you call CSVParser.getLine() I would it to expect to block until a eol or eof is encountered.  Instead the method blocks until it has recieved a char after the eol.  This seems to be because ExtendedBufferReader blocks on lookaheadchar in read().  It should check to see if there the underlying input stream is ready before blocking to read the lookaheadchar.
