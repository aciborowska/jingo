A CSV-field with the contents "This is text with a \""quoted"" string" gives the error
"invalid  char between encapsualted token end delimiter". If the backslash is not immediately before the double quote, everything is fine.
The same error occurs when the backslash is the last character in the field (directly before the delimiter), like:
"This is a text with a backslash \".
Here the reason might be that the backslash also works as an escape character like in
"This is a field with a \"quoted\" text" (no error, just the quotes in the resulting field)
