All the descriptions of the CSV format that I've seen state that:

Double quotes (") are escaped using two double quotes (""), rather than a backslash (\").
Embedded line breaks are allowed and don't need to be escaped... just enclose the field in double quotes.
Because backslashes are not used to escape double quotes or line breaks, the backslashes themselves do not need to be escaped.

CSVPrinter#escapeAndQuote(String) breaks these rules. Why?
