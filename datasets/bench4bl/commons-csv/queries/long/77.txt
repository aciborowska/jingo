According to the RFC [1]:
Section 2.4

... Spaces are considered part
of a field and should not be ignored.
Also, the RFC does not mention that blank lines are to be ignored.
However, some of the alternate CSV "specifications" referenced by RFC 4180 do say that spaces are ignored.
I've not yet found a mention to say that blank lines are to be ignored.
