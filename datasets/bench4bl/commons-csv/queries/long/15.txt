original line: My line is containing ", symbols
line in CSV file after "Save as CSV" in Excell: "My line containing "", symbols"
line is CSV file as output from CSVPrinter with EXCELL_STRATEGY: "My line containing \", symbols"
as a result when you will try to open that file in the excell you see text inside two cells:
1 cell: My line containing \
2 cell: symbols
is it again Microsoft "features", that are "improving" RFC?
