The CSVFormat methods isEscaping() and isEncapsulating() are package protected, whereas the other 3 isXXX() methods are public.
There seems no reason for this difference.
These are external settings - they are defined by the user - so I don't see why the methods should not be public.
AFAICT making them public would not commit the API to anything new.
