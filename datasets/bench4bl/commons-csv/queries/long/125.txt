Hi,
Commons-csv doesn't have a release yet, and this week the snapshot builds stopped working on java 6. Digging into the documentation I become aware that project only works with java 7. It worked fine on java 6 last week.
I understand that for some reason the project needs java 7 code.
Said all this, I ask if it is possible to make a release based on last week code as a milestone for java 6? Or if not possible, delay requirement for java 7, make the 1.0 release and then make the next version java 7?
Best regards,
Bruno Marinho
