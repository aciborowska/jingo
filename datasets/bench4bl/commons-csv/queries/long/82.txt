The CSVRecord#get(String) method has inconsistent behaviour.
If no header mapping was provided, then it throws IllegalStateException.
If the header name is not found, null is returned.
Apart from being inconsistent, it might be useful in the future to be able to return null as a column value (as distinct from the empty string).
It should throw IllegalArgumentException for a missing header name, instead of returning null.
