FileUtil.copy(inputFs, snapshotDir, outputFs, initialOutputSnapshotDir, false, false, conf);

      if (filesUser != null || filesGroup != null) {

        setOwner(outputFs, snapshotTmpDir, filesUser, filesGroup, true);

      }

      if (filesMode > 0) {

        setPermission(outputFs, snapshotTmpDir, (short)filesMode, true);

      }



It copy snapshot manifest to initialOutputSnapshotDir, but it set owner on snapshotTmpDir. They are different directory when skipTmp is true.
Another problem is new cluster doesn't have .hbase-snapshot directory. So after export snapshot, it should set owner on .hbase-snapshot directory.
