It seems fairly easy getting a region stuck "inTransitions" (See recent filings of mine).  Also, with addition to ClusterStatus of intransitions content, you can see this state now when you do analysis.  I want to roll RC2.  0.20.0 still has issues and we even know now what the worst of them are but the fixes can wait till 0.20.1.  Meantime, I need a means of bumping stuff that is stuck from the intransistions....  for 0.20.0 release in case we trip over this scenario for then we can effect a repair at least.  Otherwise, requires restart of cluster.
