Working on a customer case where the following was given for verifyrep:



--starttime=1456790400000 \ 

--stoptime=1456876800000



Customer complained that the timestamp of a (sample) row reported as ONLY_IN_PEER_TABLE_ROWS corresponded to time outside the time range.
The code says:



final String endTimeArgKey = "--endtime=";



It turns out that usage String was wrong:



    System.err.println("Usage: verifyrep [--starttime=X]" +

        " [--stoptime=Y] [--families=A] <peerid> <tablename>");
