Clint Morgan noticed that the current HTable#getStartKeys implementation isn't correct when there are more than one table, or the table you're trying to get the start keys of isn't the only table. I believe that the solution is making sure that the scanner starts at the key that should lead off your table. We should create a TestGetStartKeys test to verify this behavior.
