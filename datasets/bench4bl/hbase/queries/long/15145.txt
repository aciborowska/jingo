In secure clusters, we protect znodes with the server principal in zk. However, if a user wants to add a replication peer or run HBCK, then she will get Auth exception. This was not a problem due to an earlier bug. 
For replication, the long term fix is HBASE-11392. However, we should still have a way to launch zkcli with the server principals for manual inspection / manipulation. 
HBCK should always assume the server principals. 
Thanks Koelli Mungee for reporting this.
