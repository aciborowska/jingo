The change in HBASE-16570 modified the balancer to compute block distributions in parallel with a pool of 5 threads.  However, because it does this every time Cluster is instantiated, it effectively bypasses the cache of block locations added in HBASE-14473:
In the LoadBalancer.balanceCluster() implementations (in StochasticLoadBalancer, SimpleLoadBalancer), we create a new Cluster instance.
In Cluster.<init>, we call registerRegion() on every HRegionInfo.
In registerRegion(), we do the following:



        regionLocationFutures.set(regionIndex,

            regionFinder.asyncGetBlockDistribution(region));



Then, back in Cluster.<init> we do a get() on each ListenableFuture in a loop.
So while we are doing the calls to get block locations in parallel with 5 threads, we're recomputing them every time balanceCluster() is called and not taking advantage of the cache at all.
