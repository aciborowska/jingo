Hbase Shell is a basic, command-line, interactive 'shell' for manipulating tables in HBase. It has support for a small set of SQL-inspired operations. Results are presented in an ASCII-table format. 
The HBase Shell aims to be to HBase what the mysql client command-line tool is to mysqld and sqlplus is to Oracle.
