Some of the filter RPC serialization still requires that code -> class mappings be added to HbaseObjectWritable.  FilterList in particular requires this for it's child filters, since it calls HbaseObjectWritable.writeObject() on each.  This makes developing custom filters a big pain, as HbaseObjectWritable must be modified and the hbase core jar re-staged to the cluster.
We should fix this so that all filters can be written as a class name + data if no code exists.
