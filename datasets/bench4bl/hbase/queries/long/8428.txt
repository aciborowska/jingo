Currently, filter that looks for IntegrationTests is broad.  Reports loads of errors as we try to parse classes we don't care about.  Let me tighten it up so it doesn't scare folks away.
It is particular bad when being run against a distribute cluster when the test context is not all present; here there are lots of ERROR reports about classes not found.
