Jaymin Patel reported the following.
In hbase cluster, adding a peer for replication, incorrectly defined zookeeper znode does not fail new peer creation. However, replication breaks down.
For example, 
below string incorrectly defines zookeeper znode as "hbase" instead of "/hbase"...



> add_peer '1', "host1.com,host2.com,host3.com:2181:hbase



This left replication broken, even after we dropped and added a new correct entry for the peer.
It wasn't until we bounced the cluster that the issue was fixed.
