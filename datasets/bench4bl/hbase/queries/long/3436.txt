When starting the master, the jars of the users maven repos get injected into the classpath as a convenience to developers. This can cause quite a debugging headache when hadoop jars don't match what's on the cluster.
We should change the start scripts to not do this if the jars exist in the lib dir. Or better yet, we would only include maven repos jars if an optional param exists in hbase-env.sh.
