In trying to solve HBASE-12285, it was pointed out that tests are writing too much to output again. At best, this is a sloppy practice and, at worst, it leaves us open to builds breaking when our test tools can't handle the flood. If Nicolas Liochon would be willing give me a little bit of mentoring on how he dealt with this problem a few years back, I'd be happy to add it to my plate.
