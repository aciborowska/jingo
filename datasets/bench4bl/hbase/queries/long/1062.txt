Given a large table, > 1000 regions for example, if a cluster restart is necessary, the compactions undertaken by the regionservers when the master makes initial region assignments can overwhelm DFS, leading to file errors and data loss. This condition is exacerbated if write load was heavy before restart and so many regions want to split as soon as they are opened.
