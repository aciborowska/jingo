right now a region may get larger then the max size set in the conf 
HRegion.needsSplit
Checks the largest column to see if its larger then max region size * 1.5 and then desides to split or not 
But  if we have more then one column the region could be vary large
example
Say we have 10 columns all about the same size lets say 40MB and the max file size is 64MB we would not split even thought the region size is 400MB well over the 96MB needed to trip a split to happen.
