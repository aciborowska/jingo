As Matteo Bertozzi comments on HBASE-16464,  there maybe race condition between SnapshotManager and SnapshotCleaner.  We should use one lock when create snapshot,  and cleanup should acquire the lock before take action.
One method is pass HMaster as param into Cleaner through FileCleanerDelegate.getDeletableFiles,  suggestions are welcomed.
