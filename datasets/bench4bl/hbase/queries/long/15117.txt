In findbugs output of recent build, we could see ICAST warnings (Result of integer multiplication cast to long) on Compactor and ExportSnapshot
From the code I guess the design is to avoid multiplication result to overflow, however current implementation cannot achieve the goal. For example, output of below codes



int i = 1000000;

long a = i * i;

long b = (long) i * i;

System.out.println(a);

System.out.println(b);



will be

-727379968

1000000000000



Will make some minor changes to resolve this issue.
