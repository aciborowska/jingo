Just noticed that both hlog_roll and compact_rs are broken in shell (at least in 0.98).
The hlog_roll broken 3 times: (1) calls admin.rollWALWriter, which no longer exists, and (2) tries to pass a ServerName, but method takes a string, and (3) uses unqualified ServerName to get a server name, which leads to an  uninitialized constant error.
compact_rs only has the latter problem.
Patch upcoming.
