It looks like whats going on is that the close flag has been set so the sleeper.sleep in below is not having an effect â€“ but looking in code, I see the close flag unset as part of initialization so I'm not sure whats up.
  private void watchMasterAddress() {
    while (!stopRequested.get() && !zooKeeperWrapper.watchMasterAddress(this)) 
{

      LOG.warn("Unable to set watcher on ZooKeeper master address. Retrying.");

      sleeper.sleep();

    }
  }
