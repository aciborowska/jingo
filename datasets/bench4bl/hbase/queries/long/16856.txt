A very small bug, a typo in exception message:



if (syncFutureSequence > currentSequence) {

              throw new IllegalStateException("currentSequence=" + syncFutureSequence

                  + ", syncFutureSequence=" + syncFutureSequence);

            }



It should print currentSequence and syncFutureSequence, but print two syncFutureSequence
