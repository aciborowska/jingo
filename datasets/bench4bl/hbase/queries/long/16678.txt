Was inspecting a perf issue, where we needed the scanner metrics as counters for a MR job. Turns out that the HBase scan counters are no longer working in 1.0+. I think it got broken via HBASE-13030. 
These are the counters:



	HBase Counters

		BYTES_IN_REMOTE_RESULTS=0

		BYTES_IN_RESULTS=280

		MILLIS_BETWEEN_NEXTS=11

		NOT_SERVING_REGION_EXCEPTION=0

		NUM_SCANNER_RESTARTS=0

		NUM_SCAN_RESULTS_STALE=0

		REGIONS_SCANNED=1

		REMOTE_RPC_CALLS=0

		REMOTE_RPC_RETRIES=0

		RPC_CALLS=3

		RPC_RETRIES=0
