Region normalizer failed to trigger merge action where expected
Steps to reproduce:

Pre-split the test table into 5 regions with keys 1,3,7,8
Insert some data for each of the split. 27K rows for regions starting with key 1, and 100K rows for each of the regions with start key 3,7 and 8
Scan the test table, and verify that these regions exists -  1) STARTKEY => ‘' ENDKEY => ’1’  2)  STARTKEY => ’1’ ENDKEY => ’3’
Turn on normalization, verify normalization switch is enabled and that normalization is true for test table
Run normalizer a few times
Scan test table again, verify that regions don’t exist anymore  1) STARTKEY => ‘' ENDKEY => ’1’  2)  STARTKEY => ’1’ ENDKEY => ’3’, but instead a new region is created with  STARTKEY => ’’ ENDKEY => ’3’
The test now fails, with the last step failing at assertion. 

Looking into the Master log, I see that normalization plan was computed for the test table but it decides that no normalization is needed for the test table, and that the regions look good.
