HClient.startUpdate establishes a lot of state for subsequent put, delete, commit and abort calls. If startUpdate is called a second time before the first update is committed or aborted, it could easily cause the first update to fail if the row associated with the second update was on a different region server, for example.
Similarly, openTable could destroy the state if it were called after a startUpdate and prior to a commit or abort.
