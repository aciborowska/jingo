A while back I'd added zoo.cfg to the hbase jar.  I added it at top-level.  Turns out that was wrong location.   It couldn't be found unless it was in a conf subdir.  Fellas trying to build unit tests that depended on hbase were getting this:



21:31 < cwensel> adding zoo.cfg to cp gets me this: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Forked Java VM exited abnormally. Please note the time in the report does not reflect the time until the VM exit.



So, I moved zoo.cfg down into conf but also moved hbase-default.xml there.  The latter was a mistake.  It should stay at top level.  In its new location, fellas were getting NPEs out of ZK Quorum Main.
