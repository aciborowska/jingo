In-house, hadoop is installed into one location and the desire is that hbase can be installed elsewhere as its own distinct component that can be revved independent of base hadoop. The wrapper scripts give the impression that this is currently possible with support for separate HADOOP_HOME/HBASE_HOME, HADOOP_CONF_DIR/HBASE_CONF_DIR, etc, only trying it this evening the scripts fail; key settings are not being forwarded out to remote regionservers on the cluster.
