Trying to run IT on a cluster shared with an other, the monkeys give up because they error out trying to kill the other fellows daemons:
Failure looks like this:



16/01/29 09:07:09 WARN hbase.HBaseClusterManager: Remote command: ps aux | grep proc_regionserver | grep -v grep | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f2 | xargs kill -s SIGKILL , hostname:ve0536.halxg.cloudera.com failed at attempt 3. Retrying until maxAttempts: 5. Exception: stderr: kill 115040: Operation not permitted

, stdout:



The operation is not permitted because there is a regionserver running that is owned by someone else. We retry and then give up on the monkey.
Fix seems simple.
