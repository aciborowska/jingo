There exists a little window during which we can lose data.  During a memcache flush, we make an inmemory copy, a 'snapshot'.  The memcache is then zeroed and off we go again taking updates.  Meantime, in background we are supposed to flush the snapshot to disk.  If this process is interrupted – e.g. the HDFS is yanked from under us or if an OOME occurs in this thread – then the content of the snapshot is lost.
