1. MLOCK_AGENT points to the wrong path in hbase-config.sh
When the mlock agent is build, the binary is installed under $HBASE_HOME/lib/native  and not under $HBASE_HOME/native
2. By default we pass $HBASE_REGIONSERVER_UID to the agent options which causes the mlock agent to attempt to do a setuid in order to mlock the memory of the RS process. We should only pass that user if specified in the environment, not by default. (the agent currently handles that gracefully)
