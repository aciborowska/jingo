This is a follow up to HBASE-11460
Josh Elser found that in 0.98, the synchronized block below should have been taken out (as was done for branch-1 +):



      synchronized (masterAndZKLock) {

        if (keepAliveZookeeperUserCount.decrementAndGet() <= 0 ){



keepAliveZookeeperUserCount is an AtomicInteger. There is no need for the synchronized block.
This issue is to remove the synchronized block.
