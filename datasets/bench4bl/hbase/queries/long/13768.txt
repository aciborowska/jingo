A logic error causes HBase in most secure configuration deployments to handle its coordination state in ZooKeeper via insecure ACLs. Anyone with remote unauthenticated network access to the ZooKeeper quorum, which by definition includes all HBase clients, can make use of this opening to violate the operational integrity of the system. For example, critical znodes can be deleted, causing outages. It is possible to introduce rogue replication endpoints. It is possible to direct the distributed log splitting facility to split arbitrary files in HDFS.
