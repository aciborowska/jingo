In a HA cluster, region server got stuck in reportForDuty retry loop if the active master is restarting and later on master switch happens before it reports successfully.
Root cause is same as HBASE-13317, but the region server tried to connect master when it was starting, so rssStub reset didnt happen as



  if (ioe instanceof ServerNotRunningYetException) {

	LOG.debug("Master is not running yet");

  }



When master starts, master switch happened. So RS always tried to connect to standby master.
