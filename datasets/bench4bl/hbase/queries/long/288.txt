Bigtable provides two in-memory caches: one for row/column data and one for disk block caches.
The size of each cache should be configurable, data should be loaded lazily, and the cache managed by an LRU mechanism.
One complication of the block cache is that all data is read through a SequenceFile.Reader which ultimately reads data off of disk via a RPC proxy for ClientProtocol. This would imply that the block caching would have to be pushed down to either the DFSClient or SequenceFile.Reader
