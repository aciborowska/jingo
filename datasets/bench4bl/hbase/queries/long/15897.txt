The following comment is wrong.
It should be 'normal_QOS < replication_QOS < replay_QOS < QOS_threshold < admin_QOS < high_QOS'
hbase-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/HConstants.java


// normal_QOS < QOS_threshold < replication_QOS < replay_QOS < admin_QOS < high_QOS

public static final int NORMAL_QOS = 0;

public static final int QOS_THRESHOLD = 10;

public static final int HIGH_QOS = 200;

public static final int REPLICATION_QOS = 5;

public static final int REPLAY_QOS = 6;

public static final int ADMIN_QOS = 100;

public static final int SYSTEMTABLE_QOS = HIGH_QOS;
