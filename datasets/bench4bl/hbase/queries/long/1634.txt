I have a .META. from bryan duxbury that has a row with only historian data.  List does whole row, not just info, so if only historian entries, a row is returned.  We then try and get a regioninfo from this row and NPE.
As to why this happens, jd suggests that since we moved to async historian updates, row may have been deleted already.  Confirm.
