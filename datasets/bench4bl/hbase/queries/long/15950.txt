While testing something else, I was loading a region with a lot of data. Writing 30M cells in 1M rows, with 1 byte values. 
The memstore size turned out to be estimated as 4.5GB, while with the JFR profiling I can see that we are using 2.8GB for all the objects in the memstore (KV + KV byte[] + CSLM.Node + CSLM.Index). 
This obviously means that there is room in the write cache that we are not effectively using.
