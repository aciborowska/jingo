I noticed moving regions was slow and due to the wait for the bucket cache to clear.  I tried setting hbase.rs.evictblocksonclose and it did not help.
I see the HStore::close method has evictonclose hard coded to true instead of letting the config dictate:
// close each store file in parallel
CompletionService<Void> completionService =
   new ExecutorCompletionService<Void>(storeFileCloserThreadPool);
for (final StoreFile f : result) {
   completionService.submit(new Callable<Void>() {
     @Override
     public Void call() throws IOException 
{

       f.closeReader(true);

       return null;

     }
   });
}
