The current os-maven-plugin may export the profile with quote on certain versions of centos/RHEL, and it introduces the error when building shade file. The error message is shown below.



    [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-shade-plugin:2.4.3:shade (default) on project hbase-protocol-shaded: Error creating shaded jar: The name "os.detected.release.like."centos"" is not legal for JDOM/XML elements: XML names cannot contain the character """. -> [Help 1]





The error is caused by the /etc/os-release which contains some quote. The os-maven-plugin 1.4.1.final+ had fixed it. Therefore, we ought to update the os-maven-plugin to 1.4.1.final+ for the user who canâ€™t change the content of the /etc/os-release.
Any comment? Thanks.
