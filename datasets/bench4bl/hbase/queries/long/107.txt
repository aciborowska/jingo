Nightly failed in TestTable (though 'patch available' build passed and it passes all tests locally).  The nightly failure has been reproduced on a machine here so looking into it (DFSClient leaseChecker thread is staying up though minidfs has been shutdown â€“ it then goes on to complain it can't connect to the destroyed 'remote' minidfs).
