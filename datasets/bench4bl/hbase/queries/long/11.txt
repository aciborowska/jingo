When a RegionServer exits unexpectedly, it often leaves its DFS files open. In the case of the redo log, this can result in a zero-length file, which a newly started RegionServer will be unable to read, causing it to exit again. It also causes DFS corruption, requiring the admin to run a dfs fsck -delete before HBase can be restarted.
