Since append will be published to RingBuffer and handled asynchronously, it's possible that one append (say append-X) of the region handled by RingBufferEventHandler between startCacheFlush and getNextSequenceId, and reset FSHLog#oldestUnflushedStoreSequenceIds which we just cleared in #startCacheFlush. This might disturb ServerManager#flushedSequenceIdByRegion like shown below (assume region-A has two CF: cfA and cfB)
1. flush-A runs to startCacheFlush and it will flush both cfA and cfB, oldestUnflushedStoreSequenceIds of regionA got cleared
 2. append-X on cfB handled by RingBufferEventHandler, oldestUnflushedStoreSequenceIds set to 10, for example
 3. flush-A runs to getNextSequenceId and returned 11
 4. ServerManager#flushedSequenceIdByRegion for regionA set to 11
 5. flush-A finishes
 6. flush-B starts and only flush cfA, getNextSequenceId returned 10, and flushedSeqId will return 9, and cause warning in ServerManager
Since this append-X will also got flushed, we should clear the oldestUnflushedStoreSequenceIds again to make sure we won't disturb
 ServerManager#flushedSequenceIdByRegion.
