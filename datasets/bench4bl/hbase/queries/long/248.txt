settings:
hbase.regionserver.optionalcacheflushinterval = 300000 (5 mins)
hbase.hregion.memcache.flush.size = 67108864 (64MB)
I am attaching a log for this everything works fine until the first flush of the memcache. but once it flushes the first time correctly it flushes back to back many times even when it does not exceed one of the two limits above.
I have not found but one spot where we update the variable LastFlushTime except when the server starts so this could be the problem but I may be missing it in the code somewhere. If it is getting updated then we need to look if something could be blocking it from updating after a memcache flush.
