For what i'm doing I found it necessary to extend HRegionServer/HRegion/HClient for some custom functionality.
Following good Java practice I see that the HBase code as been programmed defensively, keeping stuff private as much as possible.
However, for extensibility it would be nice if the servers/client were easy to extend.
Attached is a patch that makes several methods protected instead of private, adds getters to fields of inner classes, and some other modifications i found were useful for some simple extension code.
