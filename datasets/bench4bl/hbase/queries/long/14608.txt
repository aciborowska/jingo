After HBASE-14600,  we catch runtime exception if dn recover slowly,  but it has some risk to assert failed.
For example, https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK/6907/testReport/
The reason is we catch the exception, but in WALProcedureStore, it will still stop the Procedure. So when we assert stop.isRunning, it will failed.
