With the current code if an executor failure before the HFile is close it will cause problems.  This jira will have the files first write out to a file that starts with an underscore.  Then when the HFile is complete it will be renamed and the underscore will be removed.
The underscore is important because the load bulk functionality will skip files with an underscore.
