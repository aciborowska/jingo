On region split, the daughter regions are deployed on the same host as served the split parent.  This makes it so currently (unless the cluster is restarted), as a table grows, all its regions remain on the one server.
Instead, jurisdiction over who serves daughter splits should be passed to the master.  If possible, before making a determination, the master should take into consideration current cluster loadings and region distribution.
