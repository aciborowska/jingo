Binary keys, specifically ones where the first byte of the key is nul '\0' don't work:

Splits happen
Logfile indicates everything normal

But the .META. doesnt list all the regions.  It only lists the 'basic' regions: 'table,,1234'.  The other regions with the binary keys in the middle just dont seem to be in .META....
