In HBaseResources.scala :



case class RegionResource(relation: HBaseRelation) extends ReferencedResource {

  var connection: Connection = _

  var rl: RegionLocator = _

...

  override def init(): Unit = {

    connection = ConnectionFactory.createConnection(relation.hbaseConf)



Connection is created per RegionResource.
This is not necessary.
Caching of Connection's should be provided to reduce the number of concurrent Connection's.
