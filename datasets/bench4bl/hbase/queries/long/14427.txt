Over in HBASE-14421, TestFastFail has been failing assertions that talk of events that 'should' be happening. Fix. For now HBASE-14421 has disabled the 'should' assertions. They seem fine on apache jenkins build but fail fairly reliably for me on alternate HW.
To address, get familiar with the test. Change the commented out asserts to be yes/no instead of a 'likely' (On a cursory scan, it is possible that a test run may not involve preemption and it is these runs that are throwing asserts).
