In Cell interface (hbase-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/Cell.java)
(1) We have the following comment for "qualifier"



/**

  * Contiguous raw bytes that may start at any index in the containing array. Max length is

  * Short.MAX_VALUE which is 32,767 bytes.

  * @return The array containing the qualifier bytes.

  */



But getQualifierLength() returns int



int getQualifierLength();



(2) We have the following comment for "value"



  /**

   * Contiguous raw bytes that may start at any index in the containing array. Max length is

   * Integer.MAX_VALUE which is 2,147,483,648 bytes.

   * @return The array containing the value bytes.

   */



Integer.MAX_VALUE is not 2,147,483,648 (2^31), but 2,147,483,647 (2^31-1)
