Lars George found a missing bit in HBASE-15971 "Regression: Random Read/WorkloadC slower in 1.x than 0.98" Let me fix here. Let me quote the man:



BTW, in constructor we do this



```    String callQueueType = conf.get(CALL_QUEUE_TYPE_CONF_KEY,

        CALL_QUEUE_TYPE_FIFO_CONF_VALUE);

```

but in `onConfigurationChange()` we do



```    String callQueueType = conf.get(CALL_QUEUE_TYPE_CONF_KEY,

      CALL_QUEUE_TYPE_DEADLINE_CONF_VALUE);

```
