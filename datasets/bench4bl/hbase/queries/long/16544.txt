reference guide at https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#amazon_s3_configuration
(1) the title 'Using Amazon S3 Storage' is confusing.From my point of view, I think this title means that we can use S3 storage to replace HDFS, I really tried this ,   always give me errors and hbase even can not start, see error mentioned in jira HBASE-11045.
(2) And the details in this section are more about deploying HBase on Amazon EC2 cluster, which has nothing to do 'using Amazon S3 storage'
(3) In all, I think we need to remove this section, or at least clarify this section if someone fully test HBase on S3.  see HBASE-15646 for more details about this doc.
