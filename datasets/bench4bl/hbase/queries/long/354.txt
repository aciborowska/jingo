HADOOP-1644 '[hbase] Compactions should take no longer than period between memcache flushes' is about making compactions run faster.  This issue is about making splits faster.  Currently splits are done by reading as input a map file and per record, writing out two new mapfiles.  Its currently too slow.  ~30 seconds to split 120MB. Google hints in bigtable that splitting is very fast because they let the split children feed off the split parent.  Primitive testing has splitting mapfiles using raw streams running 3 to 4 times faster than splitting on mapfile keys.
