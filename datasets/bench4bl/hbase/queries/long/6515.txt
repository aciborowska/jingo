While running replication on upstream code, I am hitting  the size-limit exception while sending WALEdits to a different cluster.



com.google.protobuf.InvalidProtocolBufferException: IPC server unable to read call parameters: Protocol message was too large.  May be malicious.  Use CodedInputStream.setSizeLimit() to increase the size limit.



Do we have a property to set some max size or something?
