Sequence of call  got reverse while merging.  In code we are first doing the secure login ( which needs keytab/pricipal in config ) and then doing param parsing.  Call should be other way round



    // loading the generic options to conf

    new GenericOptionsParser(conf, args);

    

    AuthUtil.launchAuthChore(conf);
