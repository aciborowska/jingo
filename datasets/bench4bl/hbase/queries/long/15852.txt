There is a bug in HBaseFsck's adoptHdfsOrphan function.At the last of this function will create a region,which want to cover all the orphan regions.But the end key of this new region was set incorrectly.Correct region's boundary should be [startKey,endKey),but this function create a region with boundary of [startKey,endKey],this bug will leads to scan operation omit some data.
I think we should create the region like bellow,



    // create new region on hdfs. move data into place.

    HRegionInfo hri = new HRegionInfo(template.getTableName(), orphanRegionRange.getFirst(),

        Bytes.add(orphanRegionRange.getSecond(), new byte[1]));



This is to backport HBASE-15125 to branch-1.1.  HBASE-15827 could not do it due to a bug in TestHBaseFsck test suite (see HBASE-15850)
