Default mapfile index interval is every 128 entries.  Basic tests show PerformanceEvaluation mapfile test random reading 100k records in 60plus seconds.  If index interval is set to 1 so we don't have to next around looking for our record, then 100k random reads take 7 seconds.  This is using local filesystem.  If I set it to 16, then takes 12 seconds. 
Testing doing PerformanceEvaluation random reads against hbase, with interval set to 16, we run 50% faster (hdfs is in the picture).
