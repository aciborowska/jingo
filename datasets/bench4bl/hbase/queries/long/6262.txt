The problem is the key is printed raw without filtering for control codes/non-displayable characters. Consequently, row 264000's row key includes the data <ESC>P (hex: 1B 50) which initiates a VT100/ANSI DCS sequence, which normally must be terminated by a DCS string terminator code, <ESC>\ (hex: 1B 5C) (cf.
At row 264000, <ESC>P appears, but is not followed by the <ESC>\ termination code â€“ so instead of data being output to the display, it is getting buffered by the terminal to complete the DCS command. Result: the data is not displayed (xterminal) or the terminal locks up (gnome-terminal).
Note that this is a potential for abusing this "feature" to hide/alter information displayed on the screen, since an arbitrary terminal control codes could potentially be constructed and injected into a rowkey.
If you open a VT100-emulating terminal window can cat the attached file, as-is, it would hang after displaying the starting portion of the line for row 264000.
