After trying to figure out whether shortcircuit reads would work on my system, I studied the book and found conflicting information.
It's suggested in section 92.2, that dfs.client.read.shortcircuit is an option in hbase-site.xml, but the supposedly complete default configuration in section 7 does not include this setting. This leads to confusion on whether it's sufficient to enable this setting in hdfs-site.xml, or whether it needs to be added to both configurations.
