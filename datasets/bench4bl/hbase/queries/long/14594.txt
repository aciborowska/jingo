HADOOP-12437 introduced a new API to org.apache.hadoop.net.DNS: getDefaultHost(String, String, boolean).
The purpose of this method (the boolean argument really) is to change the functionality so that when rDNS fails, InetAddress#getCanonicalHostName() is consulted which includes resolution via the hosts file.
The direct application of this new method is relevant on hosts with multiples NICs and Kerberos enabled.
Sadly, this method only exists in 2.8.0-SNAPSHOT, so to benefit from the fix without great pain, some reflection is required.
