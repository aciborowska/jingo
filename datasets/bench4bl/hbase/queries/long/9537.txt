I was using HBase complete bulk load to transfer the output of ImportTsv to a table in HBase, and I noticed that it copies the output instead of cutting. This takes long time for my gigabytes of data.
In HBase documentation (http://hbase.apache.org/book/ops_mgt.html#completebulkload) I read that the files would be moved not copied. Can anyone help me with this?
I use Hbase 0.94.11 and Hadoop 1.2.1. The file system of bulkload output directory and hbase cluster are the same, too.
I've also coded a MapReduce job using HFileOutputFormat. When I use LoadIncrementalHFiles to move the output of my job to HBase table, it still copies instead of cut.
