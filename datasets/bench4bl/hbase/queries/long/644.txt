RegionServer was carrying ROOT and having trouble writing HDFS.  RegionServer judged that a flush failed and reported a DroppedSnapshotException.  Usually, the filesystem check would fail and set all the abort flags but it in this case filesystem somehow returned healthy and the flags were not set.  The code path shutdown the RPC only and exited then we exited the Flusher.  All the rest of the RegionServer stayed up and kept reporting the master.  The master thought it alive and kept trying to scan the unreachable ROOT.  Cluster was hosed until manual intervention 20 minutes later.
