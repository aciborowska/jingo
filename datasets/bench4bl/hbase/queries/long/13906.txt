During my investigation of HBASE-13833, I made this comment

One other thing: should we somehow handle NeedUnmanagedConnectionException similarly to DoNotRetryIOException? It's too late to wire them up thusly, but for the case of bulk load when the bug is expressed, we go through the full 35x retry loop before eventually failing the RPC. This would be applicable to branch-1.
This would apply only to branch-1 as master no longer has unmanaged connections. Probably we cannot change the inheritance hierarchy due to compatibility guarantees, but maybe we can do something like everywhere we look for DNRIOE, we do the same for NUCE.
