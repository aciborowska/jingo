testRegionSplit and testRegionMerge were temporarily disabled by HBASE-16975.
HBASE-9465 has an assumption that when we split a region, two daughter regions are in same RS with the parent region. But after HBASE-14551 went in, daughter regions may be assigned to other RS directly.  
This issue is to handle the new behavior and reenable the tests.
