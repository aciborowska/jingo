ClassFinder logs a bunch of errors about some random classes it cannot load. This is not useful. Ideally it should only log the classes if they satisfy the other criteria, such as the name filter, but as far as I remember the organization of code that is checked after the class is loaded. 
Also maybe IntegrationTestTool should have a list command that will list the tests that can be run, and tell ClassFinder to list the JARs/directories examined.
