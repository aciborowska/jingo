The newly added global switch to enable the new normalizer functionality is never used apparently, meaning it is always on. The hbase-default.xml has this:

  <property>

    <name>hbase.normalizer.enabled</name>

    <value>false</value>

    <description>If set to true, Master will try to keep region size

      within each table approximately the same.</description>

  </property>



But only a test class uses it to set the switch to "true". We should implement a proper if statement that checks this value and properly disables the feature cluster wide if not wanted.
