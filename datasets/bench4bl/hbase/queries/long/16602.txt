Here is the TODO item:



    // TODO: LogCleaners do not have a way to get the Connection from Master. We should find a

    // way to pass it down here, so that this connection is not re-created every time.

    // It is expensive



We can utilize the facility added by HBASE-16490:
retrieve connection from MasterServices passed in init() method.
