Currently there are two LoadIncrementalHFiles#doBulkLoad() methods.
One returns a Map:



  public Map<LoadQueueItem, ByteBuffer> doBulkLoad(Map<byte[], List<Path>> map, final Admin admin,



The other one is void return type.
This issue makes both methods record return value which is used by the run() method.
