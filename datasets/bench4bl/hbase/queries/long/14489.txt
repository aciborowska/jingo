During an unrelated test I found that when scanning a tall table with CQ only and filtering most results at the server, 50% of time is spend in postScannerFilterRow, even though the coprocessor does nothing in that hook.
We need to find a way not to call this hook when not needed, or to question why we have this hook at all.
I think ramkrishna.s.vasudevan added the hook (or maybe Anoop Sam John). I am also not sure whether Phoenix uses this hook (James Taylor?)
