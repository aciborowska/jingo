See testScanAcrossSnapshot in TestMemStore around #126:



        // Row count is same as column count.

        // On snapshot, need to reseek our scanner.  TODO: HBASE-

        // assertEquals("count=" + count + ", result=" + result,

        //   rowCount, result.size());



The code is commented out.
This is a new bit of code aded by me fixing hbase-1738.   Its meant to verify we are getting out the right number of columns.  Well, after adding in new data after a snapshot, we're failing to return first record because we're seeked to what used to be first on this row â€“ not the value that was just uploaded.   Means we may skip value on occasion scanning.  Need to fix but don't think it critical for RC2 (We used to skip volumes before hbase-1738 in same circumstance).
