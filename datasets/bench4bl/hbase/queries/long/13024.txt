61.1. Cluster Connections

The API changed in HBase 1.0. Its been cleaned up and users are returned Interfaces to work against rather than particular types. In HBase 1.0, obtain a cluster Connection from ConnectionFactory and thereafter, get from it instances of Table, Admin, and RegionLocator on an as-need basis. When done, close obtained instances. Finally, be sure to cleanup your Connection instance before exiting. Connections are heavyweight objects. Create once and keep an instance around. Table, Admin and RegionLocator instances are lightweight. Create as you go and then let go as soon as you are done by closing them. See the Client Package Javadoc Description for example usage of the new HBase 1.0 API.
