As HBASE-11386 mentioned, the parse code about replication table-cfs config will be wrong when table name contains namespace and we can only config the default namespace's tables in the peer. It is a bug for all branches which support namespace. HBASE-11393 resolved this by use a pb object but it was only merged to master branch. Other branches still have this problem. I thought we should fix this bug in all branches which support namespace.
