If there are two bulkloaded hfiles in a region with same seqID and duplicate keys*, get and scan may return different values for a key.
More details:

one of the rows had 200k+ columns. say row is 'r', column family is 'cf' and column qualifiers are 1 to 1000.
hfiles were split somewhere along that row, but there were a range of columns in both hfiles. For eg, something like - hfile1: ["",  r:cf:70) and hfile2: [r:cf:40, ....).
Between columns 40 to 70, some (not all) columns were in both the files with different values. Whereas other were only in one of the files.

In such a case, depending on file size (because we take it into account when sorting hfiles internally), we may get different values for the same cell (say "r", "cf:50") depending on what we call: get "r" "cf:50" or get "r" "cf:".
I have been able to replicate this issue, will post the instructions shortly.

not sure how this would happen. These files are small ~50M, nor could i find any setting for max file size that could lead to splits. Need to investigate more.
