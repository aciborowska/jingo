IntegrationTestBulkLoad failed on us one time, but the reducers are throwing ClassNotFoundException instead of the log statements. We should fix to get some more information. 
Also re-running the verify helps a lot in IntegrationTestIngest and ITBLL. We should do that here as well. It helps us with differentiating ephemeral issues (like scan visibility, etc) than real data loss issues.
