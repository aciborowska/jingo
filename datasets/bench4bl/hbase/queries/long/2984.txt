I changed the replication on a family that was also VERSIONS => 1 and COMPRESSION => LZO. I forgot that you have to respecify everything everytime you alter a family, so both were reset to 3 and NONE. Then the regions were compacted... and it has been splitting for about 20 minutes now. Fortunately this is our MR environment so our web site isn't affected, but it's still a major pain. Oh and also the table cannot be disabled to be re-altered since split parents are always present (I hope it'll stop splitting before midnight).
The shell should use the old values for attributes that aren't changed.
