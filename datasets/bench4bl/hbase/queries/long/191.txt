TableInputFormat.TableRecordReader.next has the following:
  if (m_endRow.getLength() > 0 && (tKey.getRow().compareTo(m_endRow) < 0))
          hasMore = false;
It should be:
  if (m_endRow.getLength() > 0 && (tKey.getRow().compareTo(m_endRow) >= 0))
          hasMore = false;
TestTableMapReduce test passes because it tested map-reduce on a single-region table.
The problem only shows on a multi-region table. The patch includes changes to TestTableMapReduce
so map-reduce is tested on a multi-region table as well. The multi-region table is created
in a similar way as done in TestSplit.
