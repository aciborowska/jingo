Following on from HBASE-9007 (where we disabled the test) and HBASE-9008 (where we reenabled it w/ debugging), TestReplicationKillMasterRSCompressed.killOneMasterRS failed here: http://54.241.6.143/job/HBase-TRUNK-Hadoop-2/org.apache.hbase$hbase-server/421/testReport/junit/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication/TestReplicationKillMasterRSCompressed/killOneMasterRS/
Jean-Daniel Cryans Does it have your debugging going on?
