In listValidReplicationPeers(), we're creating the peer Configuration based on the source connection configuration and simply applying the peer ZK cluster key.  This causes any additional properties present in the ReplicationPeerConfig configuration to not be applied.
We should instead be using the configuration returned by ReplicationPeers.getPeerConf(), which we already call in that method.
