Operation step:
1, startup cluster with HA master
2, the active master crashed while it is creating table with region 
3, backup master become active.
4, I want to drop the table
5, the active master crashed
So the issue is that if a region was closed and disabled when the first master was running, it won't be assigned anywhere and won't be in transition either (it's called being in RIT in the code). When the new master comes around, and disable is called, it does a check to see if the region is in RIT but not if it was already disabled, and fails on NPE because it's not assigned to anyone.
