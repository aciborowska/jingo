Currently if try to locate region when underlying connection is closed, we will retry and wait at least 10s for each round until exhausted (refer to the catch clause of RpcRetryingCallerImpl#callWithRetries and RegionServerCallable#sleep for more details), which is unnecessary and time-costing.
The issue is caused by user incorrectly manipulating connection, which shows the disadvantage of force user to handle connection life cycle and proves the necessity to support auto-managed connection as we did before, as indicated in HBASE-17009
In this JIRA we will make it fail fast in the above case.
