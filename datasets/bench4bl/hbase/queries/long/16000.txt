The docs for our CAS operations that accept a CompareOp are too vague. They're copied from the part that implies CompareOp.EQUAL, which means they don't tell you how your op, the provided value, and any present value are compared.
Only by digging into HRegion.java can I see that the operation is, for example with CompareOp.GREATER, we get value.compareTo(existingKeyValue) > 0. Javadocs should be explicit about the order of operands.
