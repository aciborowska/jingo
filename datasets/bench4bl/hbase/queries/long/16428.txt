Compiling a Spark application using Spark 2.0.0 will fail when the HBaseContext is referenced as this module references spark.Logging. In Spark 2.0.0 this was moved to a private location as it was never intended to be used outside of the Spark API.
The actual error code is:

[ERROR] error: missing or invalid dependency detected while loading class file 'HBaseContext.class'.
[INFO] Could not access type Logging in package org.apache.spark,
[INFO] because it (or its dependencies) are missing.
See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13928 for details on this change to Spark.
