Just now, cheddar up on IRC had table of 2k regions.  A disable and drop gave him 2k rows in meta of historian info.  He couldn't progress.  Had to make below script for him:



meta = HTable.new(".META.")

historian = "historian:"

scanner = meta.getScanner([historian].to_java(java.lang.String))

while (result = scanner.next())

      meta.deleteAll(result.getRow())

end

exit 0



This flakey disable/enable/drop is frustrating users.  Need to fix.
