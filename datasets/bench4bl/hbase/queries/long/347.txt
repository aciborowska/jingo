The less configuration needed starting a regionserver the better.  Currently the regionserver needs to read hadoop-site mainly so it knows which filesystem to go against.  If it could get this info from the master instead when it gets the response to its reporting-for-duty message, then the dependency on hadoop-site.xml could mostly go away.
Looking at regionserver, it looks like it would just take a little reorganization so that the hlog opening and the startup of worker threads doesn't happen until after we get our first response from the master.
