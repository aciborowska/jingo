What i observed was



try {

      ZKAssign.asyncCreateNodeOffline(watcher, state.getRegion(),

        destination, cb, state);

    } catch (KeeperException e) {

      if (e instanceof NodeExistsException) {

        LOG.warn("Node for " + state.getRegion() + " already exists");

      } else {

        server.abort("Unexpected ZK exception creating/setting node OFFLINE", e);

      }

      return false;

    }

return true;



The asyncCreateNodeOffline just always returns true because it does not wait for the callback to take action. Also the callback does not throw NodeExistsException.
In short the catch block is a dead code.
