I use hbase0.941 and hadoop-0.20.2-cdh3u5 version.
The HBase support checksums in HBase block cache in HBASE-5074 jira.
The  HBase  support checksums for decrease the iops of  HDFS, so that HDFS
dont't need to read the checksum from meta file of block file.
But in hadoop-0.20.2-cdh3u5 version, BlockSender still read the metadata file even if the
 hbase.regionserver.checksum.verify property is ture.
