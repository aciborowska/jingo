On the 90-branch, you can run region_mover.rb without having FS-related configurations set (i.e. fs.defaultFS, fs.default.name, hbase.rootdir).
This is not the case against 0.92+.  The reason is that region_mover.rb calls:



r.getTableDesc().getName()



where r is an HRegionInfo.  In 0.92+ this actually reads off the filesystem, which is unnecessary to just get the table name.
I think copy_table.rb has the same issue, but haven't looked into it enough.
