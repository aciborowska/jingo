hbase tests failed in the nightlies and in a few previous patch builds.  Suspect is use of TextSequence in place of creating new Text instances every time (though, it passed its patch build and a nightly succeeded with TextSequence in place).  I reviewed the patch.  Looks like all TextSequence uses should be safe.   Looking at console for last night failures, at least one seems to be complaint about hdfs accesses.   Will wait till hudson starts working again building patches regularly before trying experiments â€“ e.g. backing out TextSequence patch to see if it makes a difference.
