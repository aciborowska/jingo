scan will always broken if we set LIMIT more than 1 with rs  hbase.client.rpc.codec set to org.apache.hadoop.hbase.codec.KeyValueCodecWithTags.
How to reproduce:
1. 1 master + 1 rs, codec use KeyValueCodecWithTags.
2.  create a table table_1024B_30g，1 cf and with only 1 qualifier, then load some data with ycsb，.  Use Diff DataBlockEncoding
3. scan 'table_1024B_30g', 
{LIMIT => 2, STARTROW => 'user5499'}
, STARTROW  is set any valid start row.
4. scan failed.
this should be bug in KeyValueCodecWithTags, after some investigations, I found some the key not serialized correctly.
