While performing Grant command to a specific column family in a table - to a specific group does not produce needed results. 
However, when specific user is mentioned (instead of group name) in grant command, it becomes effective
Steps to Reproduce : 
1) using super-user, Grant a table/column family level grant to a group
2) login using a user ( part of the above group) and scan the table. It does not return any results
3) using super-user, Grant a table/column family level grant to a specific user ( instead of group) 
4) login using that specific user and scan the table. It produces correct results.
