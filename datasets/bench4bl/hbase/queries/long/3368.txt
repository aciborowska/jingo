Another good one.  Look at these excerpts from master log:



2010-12-16 00:49:45,749 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.ServerManager: Received REGION_SPLIT: TestTable,0078922610,1292373363753.490b382bae33642d12cd717b5785698b.: Daughters; TestTable,0078922610,1292460584999.c8b95dfc9a671083bafdaa0341279777., TestTable,0078933586,

2010-12-16 00:49:46,132 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.handler.OpenedRegionHandler: Opened region TestTable,0078922610,1292373363753.490b382bae33642d12cd717b5785698b. on XXX185,60020,1292460570976



... so the split will have cleared the parent from in-memory data structures and then the open handler will add them back (though region is offlined, split).
Then the balancer runs....... only no one is holding the region thats being balanced.
Over on XXX185 I see the open and then split at these times:

So, the fact that it takes the Master a while to get around to the zk watcher processing messes us up.
Root problem is that we're using two different message buses, zk and then heartbeat.  Intent is to do all over zk and remove hearbeat but looking at what to do for 0.90.0.
