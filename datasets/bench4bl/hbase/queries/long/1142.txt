Ambiguous issue name.. sorry.
The thrift server has loads of getText(..) calls. Which is a local function that checks for utf8 compliance, we don't need them anywhere, because we don't use Text anymore.
There is probably other things we missed last time we updated the api, that we should also clean up while we're at it. Open to suggestions.
