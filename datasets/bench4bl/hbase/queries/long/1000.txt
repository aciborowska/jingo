When interrupted, the Sleeper.sleep method should exit if the stop flag was given, otherwise it should continue sleeping. Currently it seems to exits regardless, which means the stop flag is meaningless.
Here is the relevant code, from src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/util/Sleeper.java:

  public void sleep(final long startTime) {
    if (this.stop.get()) {
      return;
    }
    long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long waitTime = this.period - (now - startTime);
    if (waitTime > this.period) {
      LOG.warn("Calculated wait time > " + this.period +
        "; setting to this.period: " + System.currentTimeMillis() + ", " +
        startTime);
    }
    if (waitTime > 0) {
      try {
        Thread.sleep(waitTime);
        long slept = System.currentTimeMillis() - now;
        if (slept > (10 * this.period)) {
          LOG.warn("We slept " + slept + "ms, ten times longer than scheduled: " +
            this.period);
        }
      } catch(InterruptedException iex) {
        // We we interrupted because we're meant to stop?  If not, just
        // continue ignoring the interruption
        if (this.stop.get()) {
          return;
        }
      }
    }
  }


Essentially, the 'if (waitTime > 0)' portion needs to change to a while loop so that the sleeping will continue after an interruption occurs. I'll attach a patch when I get around to fixing it.
