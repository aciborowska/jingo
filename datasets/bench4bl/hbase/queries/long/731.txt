The HBase shell has several issues with the delete and deletefc commands.  Both commands give some form of error message when the correct arguments (according to the help text) are entered.  After a first glance at the code and some discussion with Stack, it looks like delete can be fixed and deletefc will be removed from the shell (the underlying method call does not provide the functionality described in the help text).
