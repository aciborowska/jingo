HBase needs to provide a combination of FuzzyFilte rand CompareFilter to be able to compare based on part of the key.
Something like:
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxYYYYxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And we want to filter all rows where YYYY is greater than a certain value.
Fuzzy filter can do the test on YYYY but only on exact match
CompareFilter can to GREATER but on the entire key...
