testScanSplitOnRegion was test added to fix hbase-810, puts happening while an outstanding scanner and then a split.  We used to wait on the scanner to finish so was possibility of deadlock.  We no longer wait so this condition that we fixed no longer happens.  I'm going to just remove the test since whats happening now is that on split, the concurrent puts are just failing with NSRE, which is what you'd expect if a split under them.
