InclusiveStopFilter only works with non-reversed Scans, it will not filter for reversed Scans, because it doesn't flip the cmp-operand in the reversed case. In fact, it doesn't even use the Filter.reverse flag.
it should be something like this:
if (reversed) {
            if (cmp > 0) 
{

                done = true;

            }
        }
        else {
            if (cmp < 0) {
                done = true;
            }
        }
