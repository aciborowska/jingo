The description in the following is wrong:

  <property>

    <name>hbase.dynamic.jars.dir</name>

    <value>${hbase.rootdir}/lib</value>

    <description>

      The directory from which the custom filter/co-processor jars can be loaded

      dynamically by the region server without the need to restart. However,

      an already loaded filter/co-processor class would not be un-loaded. See

      HBASE-1936 for more details.

  </property>



The DynamicClassLoader is not used for coprocessors, but only for filters, comparators, and exceptions. Fix.
