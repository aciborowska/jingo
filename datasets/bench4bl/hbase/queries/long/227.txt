HADOOP-2056 encoded region names so they could be used safely as names of directories on the filesystem.  Needs to be a means of going from actual region name to its encoded on-disk representation; currently its missing.  At a minimum, have logs list both the region name and its hashed representation when iterating .META. table content: i.e. add hash representation to HRegionInfo.
