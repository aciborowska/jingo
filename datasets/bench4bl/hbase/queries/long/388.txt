HScanner has a non-functional support for filters.  Upon writing scanner tests for filters in TestScanner2, I discovered that HScanner only increments each of its sub-scanners when the filtering decision is false.  Until now this has not been a problem, because none of the other processes that use HScanner also use filters.  The patch to be posted will fix the HScanner incrementation problem, and add testing for filters to TestScanner2.
