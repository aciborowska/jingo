While looking to see if there was a standard method in the code base for testing for the empty start and end row, I noticed some cases that are using unsafe reference equality checks and thus may have incorrect behavior in boundary cases:
ScanQueryMatcher.checkPartialDropDeleteRange
StripeStoreFileManager.findStripeForRow
It looks like both are intended to support stripe compaction
