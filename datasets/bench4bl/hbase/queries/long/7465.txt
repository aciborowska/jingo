CleanerChore has the following lines:



    // if all the children have been deleted, then we should try to delete this directory. However,

    // don't do so recursively so we don't delete files that have been added since we checked.

    return canDeleteThis ? fs.delete(toCheck, false) : false;



has a race condition where the directory can have a file added underneath of it between being determined 'ok to delete' and not. As the comment mentions, we don't do a recursive delete to avoid deleting those files. However, the non-recursive delete of the directory throws an IOException.
