Suppose we have two tables T1 and T2

Create full backup T1 with backup id = B1
Create full backup T2 backupId = B2
New data arrived into file WAL1
Create incremental backup of T1 with backupId = B3
Create incremental backup of T2 with backupid = B4

The directory structure for backup site after this steps
BACKUP_ROOT/WALs/B3
BACKUP_ROOT/WALs/B4
BACKUP_ROOT/T1/B1
BACKUP_ROOT/T2/B2
File WAL1 may end up either in BACKUP_ROOT/WALs/B3 or in both: 
BACKUP_ROOT/WALs/B3 and BACKUP_ROOT/WALs/B4 location. Both are bad: in first case we lose data for backup B4 in second case we have duplicate copies of WAL1
