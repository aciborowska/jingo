As reported by 鈴木俊裕 up on the mailing list – see "Performance degradation between CDH5.3.1(HBase0.98.6) and CDH5.4.5(HBase1.0.0)" – our unification of sequenceid and MVCC slows Increments (and other ops) as the mvcc needs to 'catch up' to our current point before we can read the last Increment value that we need to update.
We can say that our Increment is just done wrong, we should just be writing Increments and summing on read, but checkAndPut as well as batching operations have the same issue. Fix.
