Sometimes, builds fail mysteriously and leave lots of tests hanging. This makes  flaky list go crazy.
This patch adds that feature to specify build ids to exclude in report-flakies.py.
If we find that a build screwed up, we can exclude it using "exclude=" option in --urls param and rerun the job to fix the flaky list.
