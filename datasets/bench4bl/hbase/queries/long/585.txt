When connecting to thrift, using the mutateRow() or mutateRowTs() functions, if the column specified belongs to a non-existent column family, thrift just hangs, and the caller eventually gets a TException due to socket timeout.
I would have expected to get a more hbasey exception along the lines of "Column family 'foo' does not exist for table 'bar'".
