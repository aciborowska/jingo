I am running a mapreduce job (~400 simultaneous map tasks) that makes random reads from hbase.  I have put a varnishd reverse proxy cache in front of a single rest server.  The single rest server's jetty appears to be running out of threads:
2008-02-01 23:17:16,971 INFO org.mortbay.http.SocketListener: LOW ON THREADS ((256-256+1)<2) on SocketListener0@0.0.0.0:61234
2008-02-01 23:17:17,116 WARN org.mortbay.http.SocketListener: OUT OF THREADS: SocketListener0@0.0.0.0:61234
2008-02-01 23:17:19,255 INFO org.mortbay.http.SocketListener: LOW ON THREADS ((256-256+1)<2) on SocketListener0@0.0.0.0:61234
The default for jetty is to use a thread pool of 256 threads.  But I'd like to be able to specify (preferably in hadoop-site.xml) how large the thread pool should be â€“ in this case it needs to have as many threads as I have simultaneous map tasks.
