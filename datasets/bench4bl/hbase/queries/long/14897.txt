It comes from email list which stack post.
This is the some relates QA information.
https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Trunk_matrix/512/jdk=latest1.8,label=Hadoop/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master/TestTableLockManager/testReapAllTableLocks/
The reason is here.



    writeLocksObtained.await();

    writeLocksAttempted.await();



writeLocksAttempted maybe count down to 0 before created node on ZK,  and main thread will go on to run lockManager.reapWriteLocks(),  And after that node was created on ZK,  so relates lock acquire will timeout.
I upload a patch which can reproduce this issue.
