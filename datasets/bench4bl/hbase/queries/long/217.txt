HADOOP-1338 introduced a critical problem in region server shutdown.

when a region server is told by the master to quiesce, closing a region can cause a concurrent split to fail, possibly corrupting the region.

In addition, the master may never transition from quiesce to full shutdown, leaving some region servers still running in quiesce state.
