consider this scenario: rs A/B/C, A dies, B and C race to lock A to help replicate A's left unreplicated hlogs, B wins and successfully creates lock under A's znode, but before B copies A's hlog queues to its own znode, B also dies, and C successfully creates lock under B's znode and helps replicate B's own left hlogs. But A's left hlogs can't be replicated by any other rs since B left back a lock under A's znode and B didn't transfer A's hlog queues to its own znode before B dies.
