TestDFSAbort failed in nightly #253.  It seems to have been the same failure mode as seen in HADOOP-1924 where the rpc Client is stuck on a flush.  It actually happened twice during the build, once in TestDFSAbort and then again in a slight variation where this time the test client hung on the flush in TestRegionServerAbort.  Jim managed to provoke a couple of thread dumps.  See http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/253/console.
