A simple test below



    byte[] bytes = {'a','b','c','d','e','f'};

    ImmutableBytesWritable writable1 = new ImmutableBytesWritable(bytes, 1, bytes.length);

    ImmutableBytesWritable writable2 = new ImmutableBytesWritable(writable1);

    Assert.assertTrue("Mismatch", writable1.equals(writable2));



would fail with AssertionFailedError.
The reason for this is 



  public ImmutableBytesWritable(final ImmutableBytesWritable ibw) {

    this(ibw.get(), 0, ibw.getSize());

  }



the constructor would always assume 0 as the offset while it can get it from ibw.getOffset() method.
