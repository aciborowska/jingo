I use hbase 0.98.12.1. it is not CDH or HDP but apache package. 
well, regionserver make lots of CLOSE_WAIT connection. 
on inquiry, hdfs-client 2.2 has connection leak (HDFS-5671)
default hdfs client version of hbase 0.98 is 2.2
I have resolved it building hbase package with hadoop 2.7.1.
I wish upgrade hdfs-client version at pom.xml
