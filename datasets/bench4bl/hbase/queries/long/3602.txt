Just had a case of what looked like lost edits from .META. resulting in overlapping regions up in .META.  Needed online merge tool to fix (didn't have it).  Also, finding the bad regions wasn't as easy as it could have been.  hbck printed out cryptic message about count of regions not being right, not enough 'edges'.  ./bin/check_meta.rb actually wrote out the problem issues saying a hole in table.  Move this into hbck and kill bin/check_meta.rb.
