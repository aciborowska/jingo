Getting this error in Eclipse for Stargate build.xml:
Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
Default target archives does not exist in this project	build.xml	/hbase/src/contrib/stargate	line 1	Ant Buildfile Problem
It's complaining because of this line:
<project name="stargate" default="archives" basedir=".">
There is no target named "archives" in the Ant build file.
