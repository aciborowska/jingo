The KeyValueCodec's Decoder makes NoTagsKeyValue. The WalCellCodec also makes this Decoder and so while reading Cells after RS crash, we will loose all tags in Cells.  (While writing to WAL using WALCellCodec, we are preserving Cell tags.)
In case of SecureWALCellCodec, we are not even writing Cell tags to WAL.
