I was using the HBase Spark Module at a client with Kerberos and I ran into an issue with the Scan.  
I made a fix for the client but we need to put it back into HBase.  I will attach my solution, but it has a major problem.  I had to over ride a protected class in spark.  I will need help to decover a better approach
