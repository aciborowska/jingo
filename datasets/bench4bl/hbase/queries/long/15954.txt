One of the surprising findings of one of the HBaseCon presentations from Nitin Verma, Pravin Mittal, Maxim Lukiyanov was that REST server is logging every request in DEBUG which is enabled by default. This obviously causes out-of-the-box experience to be pretty bad in terms of throughput unless DEBUG logging is turned off. 
We should bring REST server to be on par with the RS level log conventions. Individual requests to be only logged at the TRACE level.
