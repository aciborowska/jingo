Found the following list of typos/misspellings on the book.html page, and thought I would make corrections to the appropriate src/main/asciidoc files in which they are located. (This is just a good opportunity for me to become familiar with submission of fixes/patches as a prelude to beginning to make some coding contributions. This is also my first submission to the JIRA system, so corrections to content/conventions are welcome!)
[Note: I see that Misty Stanley-Jones  may be in the midst of a reformatting task – HBASE-14823 –  that might involve these same asciidoc files. Please advise if I should wait on this task to avoid a possibly cumbersome Git reconciliation mess. ]
Here is the list of typos/misspellings. The format of each item is (a) the problem is presented in brackets on the first line, and (b) the phrase (as it currently appears in the text) is on the second line.
===================
["you" should be "your", and "Kimballs'" should be "Kimball's" (move the apostrophe) in the following:]
A useful read setting config on you hadoop cluster is Aaron Kimballs' Configuration Parameters: What can you just ignore?
[Period needed after "a"]
a.k.a pseudo-distributed
["empty" is misspelled]
The default value in this configuration has been intentionally left emtpy in order to honor the old hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.upperLimit property if present.
[All occurrences of "a HBase" should be changed to "an HBase" -- 15 occurrences found]
["file path are" should be "file paths are"]
By default, all of HBase's ZooKeeper file path are configured with a relative path, so they will all go under this directory unless changed.
["times" -- plural required]
How many time to retry attempting to write a version file before just aborting. 
["separated" is misspelled]
Each attempt is seperated by the hbase.server.thread.wakefrequency milliseconds.
[space needed after quotation mark (include"limit)]
Because this limit represents the "automatic include"limit...
[space needed ("ashbase:metadata" should be "as hbase:metadata")]
This helps to keep compaction of lean tables (such ashbase:meta) fast.
[Acronym "ide" should be capitalized for clarity: IDE]
Setting this to true can be useful in contexts other than the other side of a maven generation; i.e. running in an ide. 
[RuntimeException missing an "e"]
You'll want to set this boolean to true to avoid seeing the RuntimException complaint:
