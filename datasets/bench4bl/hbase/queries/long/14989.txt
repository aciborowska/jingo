The implementation of the deprecated getWriteToWAL is backwards. It should return true if this.durability == Durability.SYNC_WAL:



/**

   * @deprecated Use {@link #getDurability()} instead.

   * @return true if edits should be applied to WAL, false if not

   */

  @Deprecated

  public boolean getWriteToWAL() {

    return this.durability == Durability.SKIP_WAL;

  }



For example, if mutation.durability is Durability.SYNC_WAL and the following code is called clonedMutation.setWriteToWAL(mutation.getWriteToWAL()), it will disable writing to the WAL for clonedMutation.
