Based on a user discussion, I think as the user pointed out rightly, when a PutSortReducer is used any visibility attribute or external attribute set on the Put will be lost as we create KVs out of the cells in the puts whereas the ACL and visibility are all set as Attributes. 
In TextSortReducer we tend to read the information we tend to read the information from the parsed line but here in PutSortReducer we don't do it. I think this problem should be in all the existing versions where we support Tags. Correct me if am wrong here.
