Currently there're two CompactionThroughputControllerFactory in our branch-1 code base (one in o.a.h.h.regionserver.compactions package, the other in o.a.h.h.regionserver.throttle) and both are in use.
This is a regression of HBASE-14969 and only exists in branch-1. We should remove the one  in o.a.h.h.regionserver.compactions, and change the default compaction throughput controller back to NoLimitThroughputController to keep compatible with previous branch-1 version
Thanks Gary Helmling for pointing out the issue.
