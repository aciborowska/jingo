The SimpleRegionNormalizer has this:



     if ((smallestRegion.getSecond() + smallestNeighborOfSmallestRegion.getSecond()

          < avgRegionSize)) {

        LOG.debug("Table " + table + ", smallest region size: " + smallestRegion.getSecond()

          + " and its smallest neighbor size: " + smallestNeighborOfSmallestRegion.getSecond()

          + ", less than half the avg size, merging them");



It does not check for "less than half the avg size" but only "less than the avg size", that is, drop the "half". Fix message.
