Running javadoc on fresh checkout from trunk causes the following error:
 [javadoc] /home/adrian/workspace/hadoop-trunk/src/contrib/hbase/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/shell/CreateCommand.java:77: warning - @param argument "table" is not a parameter name.
This is causing Hudson to report a -1 for all patches, even though they have nothing to do with this.
