As of HBase 1.0 we no longer have binary artifacts that are tied to a particular hadoop release. The current section of the ref guide for getting started with standalone mode still refers to them:

Choose a download site from this list of Apache Download Mirrors. Click on the suggested top link. This will take you to a mirror of HBase Releases. Click on the folder named stable and then download the binary file that ends in .tar.gz to your local filesystem. Be sure to choose the version that corresponds with the version of Hadoop you are likely to use later. In most cases, you should choose the file for Hadoop 2, which will be called something like hbase-0.98.3-hadoop2-bin.tar.gz. Do not download the file ending in src.tar.gz for now.
Either remove the reference or turn it into a note call-out for versions 0.98 and earlier.
