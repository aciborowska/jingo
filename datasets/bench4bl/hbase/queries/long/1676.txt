I have 200 regions per server in my cluster.  When I take one down, then bring it back up, I only end up with about 30 regions assigned to it.  This is highly reproducible.
Furthermore, the assignment algorithm will do silly things like assign all regions of a table to one regionserver - even if it's the best server.  We need to be smarter about optimizing how regions are assigned if we want to achieve maximal performance on our clusters.
