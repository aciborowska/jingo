Scenario:
1. Add a peer 'p1' and enable table replication for a table 't1'
2. Put some data in the table 't1' and its gets replicated to peer 'p1' as expected.
3. Remove peer 'p1' and truncate the table 't1' in both source and peer cluster.
4. Now add peer 'p2' , there is no data in source cluster in table 't1' but in peer cluster 'p2' where table 't1' already exists, existing WAL data of table 't1' is getting replicated in 'p2'.
Expectation: Table 't1' in peer cluster 'p2' should only have data which is inserted in source cluster table 't1' after adding peer 'p2'
