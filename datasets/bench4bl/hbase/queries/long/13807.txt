When the file format is V2, it has no support for tags and so cells will be with 0 tags length. For such cells we make NoTagsKeyValue which avoid getTagsLength parsing overhead in KeyValue. Still HFileReaderV2 creates KeyValue.
This is a 0.98 issue only.
Also in case of DBE, we can consider the tags length and return KeyValue/NoTagsKeyValue
