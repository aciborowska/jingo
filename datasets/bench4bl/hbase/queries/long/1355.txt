Profiling I see we are calculating max versions each time:



      String value = getValue(HConstants.VERSIONS);

      this.cachedMaxVersions = (value != null)?

        Integer.valueOf(value).intValue(): DEFAULT_VERSIONS;



Caching it should improve things.  Seeing that its 10% of memory when writing and about 10% of CPU.  Reading its 10% of CPU according to profiler.
