TimeRange's constructor with a min/max came in HBASE-14355. The
constructor changed from IOException in the case of min > max to
IllegalArgumentException. That's probably a more accurate exception,
but it's a substantial source compat and behavior change for
downstream. I've flagged the issue as incompatible and asked for a
release note. For some reason the javadocs for TimeRange claim it's
"for internal use only" so maybe it shouldn't have been IA.Public in
the first place.


Jon:

A user could trigger the TimeRange constructed exception change by with the Get#setTimeRange/Scan#setTimeRange/Increment#setTimeRange apis.  The signature in these classes don't change. (master [1], branch-1.2[2], tag 1.1.3[3])
Doing a little digging, it is worth noting that no public APIs take time range as an argument (HRegion, TimeRangeTracker do but they are private), however a few public metrics return it (Get, Scan, Increment).  The comment also basically says don't use the constructor.
