I noticed while adding tests to replication_admin_test.rb for HBASE-12940 that it creates an HBase table "hbase_shell_tests_table" that is never used in any of the suite's tests. Removing the table creation statements speeds up the suite locally from 1min 10s to 2s. 
Note that until HBASE-14562 is worked, this test suite doesn't run as part of the automatic test runs.
