TestTableIndex failed in two nightly builds.
The fancy trick of passing around a complete configuration with per column indexing specification extensions inside in a Configuration value is biting us.  The interpolation code has an upper bound of 20 interpolations.
Looking at seeing if I can run the interpolations before inserting the config.  else need to move to have Configuration.substituteVars made protected so can fix ... or do config. for this job in another way.
