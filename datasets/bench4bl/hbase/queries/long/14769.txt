HBaseAdmin is marked private, so removing the functions not being used anywhere.
Also, the javadocs of overridden functions are same as corresponding ones in Admin.java. Since javadocs are automatically inherited from the interface class, we can remove these redundant 100s of lines.
Link to discussion, if it was okay to remove the functions: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hbase-dev/201512.mbox/%3CCAAjhxrovmK8AYQBA9YJJYBEgTZamav4nOtzrcWsdUiisX69qMA%40mail.gmail.com%3E
