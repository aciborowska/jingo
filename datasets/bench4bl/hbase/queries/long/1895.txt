the max length of a row has to fit into a signed short. That is 32k.  The constant is incorrect, but in the depths of KeyValue it does the right thing:
    if (rlength > Short.MAX_VALUE) 
{

      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Row > " + Short.MAX_VALUE);

    }

so your Put wont fail and instead it will fail in the KeyValue constructor.  So far only that 1 line in Put uses this constant, but we should have a correct value here.
