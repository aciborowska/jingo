Currently we have the following in XXTableBackupProcedure:



          } catch (Exception e) {

            // fail the overall backup and return

            failBackup(env, backupInfo, backupManager, e, "Unexpected BackupException : ",

              BackupType.FULL, conf);

            return Flow.NO_MORE_STATE;



However, failBackup() doesn't propagate the exception to procedure V2.
This issue is to add setFailure() calls for the propagation.
