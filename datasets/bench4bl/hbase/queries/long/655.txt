From HADOOP-2292:
> What you might do is open a HTable on the META region (HConstants.META_TABLE_NAME) and scan HConstants.COL_REGIONINFO_ARRAY which will give you back HRegionInfo objects (as bytes).
> Find the table in question by comparing your table name to regionInfo.getTableDesc().getName()
> If adding or deleting columns, check regionInfo.getTableDesc().hasFamily()
> If changing table on/off line check regionInfo.isOffline()
> If any of the regions don't meet the criteria, close the scanner, sleep and rescan.
This is a bit too complicated for me.  If you won't make enableTable/disableTable synchronous, we should at least have a HTable.isTableDisabled method.
