The check_compatibility.sh tool in dev_support uses the Java API Compliance Checker to do static analysis of source/binary incompatibilties between two HBase branches. One problem, though, is that the script has a few instances where it may return an exit code of 1 (e.g. if Maven steps fail), but this is the same exit code that the Java ACC tool itself uses to denote that the tool succeeded, but found incompatibilities.
