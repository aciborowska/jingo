So, in backup usage, the backup root dir is called backup_root. In restore, it is called backup_path. I presume these are meant to refer to the same thing?
In restore, the id for the backup is the backup_id but in describe when I am to pass a backup id, it is called backupId. Ditto on delete. In the dump of the history, the backup id is called 'ID'.
Suggest you use same name for the arg everywhere. The inconsistency makes the tool appear untrustworthy.
