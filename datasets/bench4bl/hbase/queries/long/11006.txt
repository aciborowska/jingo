Starting with HBase 0.96, it is not possible to create a table named 'data'. When a user tries to create a table named 'data', the table is added to the metastore but the region server fails to open the region.
To reproduce, I just run “hbase shell” and type in:
create ‘data’, ‘cf’
This was also verified on Apache HBase trunk by Enis from the Hortornworks forums. His comment on the bug:
There has been a change in the directory layout in HBase 0.96 for introducing namespaces. The HBase root directory now keeps all table data under the sub-directory “data”. I suspect the error is somewhere there.
