I thank we addressed this here
HADOOP-2295
but I have found it showing up again
my hlog size is set to 250,000
so on a recovery from a failed region server the recovery of scanning the logs takes longer then the 
hbase.hbasemaster.maxregionopen default of 30 secs
and the master is thinks the region is open but the region server closes the region when done recovering becuase the master sent a 
MSG_REGION_CLOSE_WITHOUT_REPORT to the region server.
I was able to get my table back online completely by adding 
hbase.hbasemaster.maxregionopen  with a value of 300000 mili secs to my hbase-site.xml file
and restart.
