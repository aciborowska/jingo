Earlier versions of the online documentation seemed to have more material around the split options available in the HBase shell - but these seem to have been omitted in the process of various updates. 
Presplitting has minimal matches and only brings up references to presplitting from code. 
However there are a number of options relating to creation of splits in tables available in the HBase shell
For example :

create table with set of split literals
create table specifying number of splits and a split algorithm
create table specifying a split file
