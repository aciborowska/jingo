Testing found two bugs using the hql page in the webapp:
+ In the html table formatter, if the select result is a single cell, the xmlenc was throwing an exception because no xhtml tags wrapping the output
+ If more than one column family in a table, the describe table output was messed drawing the column descriptions horizontally rather than vertically
