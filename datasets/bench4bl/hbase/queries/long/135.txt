HADOOP-1747 fixed an obvious failure in assignment code where regions were being handed out to multiple hosts by the twos and threes but a bug remains.  Over 260 assignments in a recent upload to a cluster of 4 machines, two regions were assigned to two different hosts.  Here's log snippet from master showing region being assigned to two different hosts:
