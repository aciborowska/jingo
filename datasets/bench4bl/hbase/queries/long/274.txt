The list of regions that make up a table in hbase are effectively kept in a mapfile.  Regions are identified by the first row contained by that region.   To find the region that contains a particular row, we need to be able to search the mapfile of regions to find the closest matching row that falls just-before the searched-for key rather than the just-after that is current mapfile getClosest behavior.
