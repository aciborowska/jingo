When processing table create and modification requests we should check the supplied schema options for settings that require mentioned classes to be available from the regionserver classpath (split policies, etc.). If we can't find the class on the classpath when processing the admin request RPC, fail the operation immediately and return an exception rather than allow problems later, such as aborts.
