The exact method I'm talking about is:



@Deprecated

  @Override

  public long incrementColumnValue(final byte [] row, final byte [] family,

      final byte [] qualifier, final long amount, final boolean writeToWAL)

  throws IOException {

    return incrementColumnValue(row, family, qualifier, amount,

      writeToWAL? Durability.SKIP_WAL: Durability.USE_DEFAULT);

  }



Setting writeToWAL to true, Durability will be set to SKIP_WAL which does not make much sense unless the meaning of SKIP_WAL is negated.
