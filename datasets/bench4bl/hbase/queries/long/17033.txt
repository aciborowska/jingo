I was looking at the other allocations for HBASE-17017. Seems that log roller thread allocates 200MB for ~7% of the TLAB space. This is a lot of allocations. 
I think the reason is this: 



while (true) {

        if (this.safePointAttainedLatch.await(1, TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS)) {

          break;

        }

        if (syncFuture.isThrowable()) {

          throw new FailedSyncBeforeLogCloseException(syncFuture.getThrowable());

        }

      }



This busy wait is causing a lot allocations because the thread is added to the waiting list.
