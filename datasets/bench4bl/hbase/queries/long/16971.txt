We should pass the “effectiveDurability” to the doWALAppend() metohd.
HRegion.java


private Result doDelta(...) {

        Durability effectiveDurability = getEffectiveDurability(mutation.getDurability());

        Map<Store, List<Cell>> forMemStore =

            new HashMap<Store, List<Cell>>(mutation.getFamilyCellMap().size());

        // Reckon Cells to apply to WAL --  in returned walEdit -- and what to add to memstore and

        // what to return back to the client (in 'forMemStore' and 'results' respectively).

        WALEdit walEdit = reckonDeltas(op, mutation, effectiveDurability, forMemStore, results);

        // Actually write to WAL now if a walEdit to apply.

        if (walEdit != null && !walEdit.isEmpty()) {

          writeEntry = doWALAppend(walEdit, durability, nonceGroup, nonce);

        } else {

}
