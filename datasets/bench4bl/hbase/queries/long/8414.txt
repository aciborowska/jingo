In the current ROOT-less trunk, hbck still tries to fix meta by looking its location in the .ROOT. table. This happens if there is no .META. assigned when hbck is ran.
HbaseFsck.java:



boolean checkMetaRegion() {

      HRegionLocation rootLocation = connection.locateRegion(

        HConstants.ROOT_TABLE_NAME, HConstants.EMPTY_START_ROW);

...

}



Running hbck while meta is in transition:



bin/hbase hbck

Version: 0.95.0-SNAPSHOT
