groupName = groupNames[counter.getAndIncrement() % groupNames.length];



Theoretically, counter can overflow and becomes negative then causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
But in practice, we need 2 billions different identifiers to make this happen, and before the overflow we will run into OOM because of a huge groupNameCache...
So not sure if it is worth to fix
