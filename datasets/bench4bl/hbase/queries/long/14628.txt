I noticed that (at least in 0.98 - master is entirely different) we create ByteBuffer just to create a byte[], which is then used to create a KeyValue.
We can save the creation of the ByteBuffer and hence save allocating an extra object for each KV we find by creating the byte[] directly.
In a Phoenix count(*) query that saved from 10% of runtime.
