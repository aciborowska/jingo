TestSnapshotFromMaster#testSnapshotHFileArchiving assumes that all hfiles will be compacted and be moved to “archive folder” after cleaning. But not all hfiles will be compacted if there are large number of hfiles.
The above may be happened if changing the default config like smaller write buffer(hbase.client.write.buffer) or ExponentialClientBackoffPolicy.
TestSnapshotFromMaster.java


// it should also check the hfiles in the normal path (/hbase/data/default/...)

public void testSnapshotHFileArchiving() throws Exception {

  //...

  // get the archived files for the table

    Collection<String> files = getArchivedHFiles(archiveDir, rootDir, fs, TABLE_NAME);



    // and make sure that there is a proper subset

    for (String fileName : snapshotHFiles) {

      assertTrue("Archived hfiles " + files + " is missing snapshot file:" + fileName,

        files.contains(fileName));

    }

  //...

}
