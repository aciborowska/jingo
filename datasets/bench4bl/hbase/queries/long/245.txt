HTable.getRow(Text) is several orders of magnitude slower than
HTable.get(Text, Text), even on rows with a single column.
This problem can be observed by the attached patch of
PerformanceEvaluation.java which changes SequentialRead to use getRow,
and prints out the time for each read. 
The test can the be run with:
bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.PerformaeEvaluation sequentialRead 1
On my laptop, the original test (using get()) produces reads on the order of 5-20
milliseconds. Using getRow(), the reads take 50-2000 ms.
