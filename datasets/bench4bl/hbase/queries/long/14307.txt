Considering that read() is not guaranteed to read all bytes, 
I'm interested to understand this particular piece of code and why is partial read treated as an error :
https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/master/hbase-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/io/hfile/HFileBlock.java#L1446-L1450
Particularly, if hbase were to use a different filesystem, say WebhdfsFileSystem, this would not work, please also see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-8943 for discussion around this.
