getclosestatorbefore was not converted to deal with the new delete types.  It only knows how to process old style deletes.  Usually all is well as edits come in but its possible to get into state where you have persisted in one file a deletefamily for all in meta and in the file behind it, there are entries on the info family.  Since closest doesn't understand deletefamily, it will return the Put rows only for the subsequent getfull, which knows how to work with deletefamilies fail.
Once this happens, table is hosed.  Seen on Bradford Stephens upload and at Powerset.  "Fix" is flush and major compact.  Gives impression that hbase is 'delicate'.  Fixing.
