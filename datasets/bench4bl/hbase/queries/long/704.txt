From the help screen on the new shell

[root@s2 hbase]# hbase shell
HBase Shell; enter 'help<RETURN>' for list of supported commands.
Version: 0.2.0-dev, r670701, Wed Jun 25 02:27:19 CDT 2008

hbase(main):001:0> create 't1' {NAME => 'f1', VERSIONS => 5}
SyntaxError: (hbase):2: , unexpected tLCURLY


The help menu gives the above example on creating table in hbase but it does not work!
If we release this for the new shell examples need to be more clear. I have not been able to create a table using the new shell yet,
Also might be worth adding the old shell back in and remove it after we release 2.0 or at lease until we work out the bugs in new client. If it would not require much updating to keep it current with the new api.
