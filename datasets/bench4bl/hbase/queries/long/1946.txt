While starting hbase I get following exception:

java.lang.NullPointerException
  at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegionServer.run(HRegionServer.java:459)
   at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)
in region server's log on the second machine whereas at first machine all going well.
We've discussed with larsgeorge this problem at IRC channel and seems problem is in HRegionServer implementation.
Patch which fixies that problem attached to this message, but it should be not a final variant, because I cannot stop hbase with this fix.
