HbaseRPC, which (to my understanding) is used whenever there is a need to connect to a server, enters an infinite loop to continually retry the connection until it succeeds.  This makes sense for server-to-server interaction, but it doesn't necessarily make sense for all client-to-server interaction.
The problem I first observed was in doing fast restarts of HBase.  When I attempted to reload the UI after a restart, it would infinitely try to re-contact the cached server location from before the restart.  The correct behavior would be to break out of the loop as soon as possible in situations like the one above.  I think that throwing a RetriesExhaustedException would be the best way to do this, although if anyone has any suggestions please let me know.
