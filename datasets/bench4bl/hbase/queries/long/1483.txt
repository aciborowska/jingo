HLog:803
                  queue.push(new HLogEntry(val, key));
The same val and key references are used in the iterator, so they keep changing their contents as we .next() through the loop.
Thus, when we are done, all the HLogEntries in logEntries will have the same HLogEdits and HLogKeys! I don't think this would have ever worked unless there is only one region in the log being split.
