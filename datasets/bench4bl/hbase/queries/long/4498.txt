HBase RPM packaging was done prior to completion of ZooKeeper RPM packaging.  In update-hbase-env.sh, it expects ZooKeeper environment script to exist in /etc/default/zookeeper-env.sh.  After several revision of ZOOKEEPER-999, it was decided to remove /etc/default/zookeeper-env.sh by ZooKeeper community.  Hence, update-hbase-env.sh should not depend on /etc/default/zookeeper-env.sh.  Instead, update-hbase-env.sh should assume ZooKeeper exists in /usr for RPM/deb packages.
