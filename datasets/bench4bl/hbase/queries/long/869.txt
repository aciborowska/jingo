On pset cluster – running 0.2.0 – I saw the following:
+ Deadlock on server carrying .META. made the .META. table inaccessible (deadlock has been fixed)
+ Out on a regionserver, we split; two new daughters are created and parent region is closed.
+ Regionserver fails to update the .META. with change in parent state and addition of two new daughter regions
Restarting the server carrying .META. got us over the deadlock but subsequently, the parent region is no longer online nor its replacements.
Attempting restart of regionserver to see if parent will come back on line (since it was not 'offlined' in .META. should come back on line again and resplit).  Ugly will be the fact that the filesystem has some trash in it – the new daughter regions.
To consider: Do not close the parent until the .META. has been successfully updated.  Also, if .META. update fails, remove daughter regions.
