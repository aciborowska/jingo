Using Base64.URL_SAFE generates URL and file name friendly format as described in Section 4 of RFC3548. http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3548.html
Using Base64.ORDERED generates URL and file name friendly format  that preserves lexical ordering as described in  http://www.faqs.org/qa/rfcc-1940.html
The default is RFC3548 format
