TestLogRollingNoCluster fails from time to time on a rig I have running here.
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: ignoring option MaxPermSize=256m; support was removed in 8.0

The test itself is a bit odd. We apparently have seen NPEs around close of a WAL while trying to sync... which I suppose makes sense if two threads involved.
Attached patch just fails the sync silently if stream is null... lets presume it a close. Adds a sync on write of trailer too... 
This patch seems to have gotten rid of the odd failure seen on a particular box here if I keep cycling the test.
