When trying to access a Thrift sever that is kerberized, a HTTP 413 full HEAD error is received. In that case, tcpdump shows http header size exceeded 4k.
This seems related to the issue outlined in  @HADOOP-8816.
The default header size limit is 4k, follow the fix for @HADOOP-8816, propose to increase the header size limit to 64k.
