In section 96.4. Bloom Filters:
 Since HBase 0.96, row-based Bloom filters are enabled by default. (HBASE-)  --> in HBASE-8450
In section 94.4.3. Configuring Server-Wide Behavior of Bloom Filters: 
io.hfile.bloom.enabled  --> io.storefile.bloom.enabled  Master switch to enable Bloom filters
io.hfile.bloom.max.fold  --> io.storefile.bloom.max.fold
io.hfile.bloom.error.rate --> io.storefile.bloom.error.rate
io.storefile.bloom.block.size --> default is 128*1024 = 131072
These properties are probably not tuned usually, but should still be fixed in the doc.
