In some of our bash scripts we are piping command in hbase shell and then parsing response to define variables.  Since 'hbase shell' output format is changed we are picking wrong values from output Here is example form gracful_stop.sh:



HBASE_BALANCER_STATE=$(echo 'balance_switch false' | "$bin"/hbase --config "${HBASE_CONF_DIR}" shell | tail -3 | head -1)



this will return "balance_switch true" instead of previous balancer  state.
