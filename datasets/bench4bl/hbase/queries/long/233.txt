Currently, hbase bin scripts and conf are present in the hadoop 'package' product  but only under the src subdirectory; scripts are non-executable.   If you try to run hbase from this location, it basically works if you chmod the scripts to make them executable but there are a few issues such as our not being able to find hbase stylesheets and logo.  
Hbase should be easier to find and run inside of a hadoop package (as long as it lives inside hadoop).   I'd suggest that packaged, hbase scripts are installed into $HADOOP_HOME/bin and that hbase-*.xml and hbase-env.sh get installed into $HADOOP_HOME/conf.  Later we might add doc too.
