TestAdmin1#testHFileReplication has been failing against hadoop-1 since (at least) this build:
https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-0.98-on-Hadoop-1.1/1082/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client/TestAdmin1/testHFileReplication/
The cause is that the following method is absent in hadoop-1 (in FSUtils#create()):



          return (FSDataOutputStream) (DistributedFileSystem.class.getDeclaredMethod("create",

            Path.class, FsPermission.class, boolean.class, int.class, short.class, long.class,

            Progressable.class, InetSocketAddress[].class).invoke(backingFs, path, perm, true,



The following fallback doesn't take replication parameter:



    return create(fs, path, perm, true);



leading to DFS replication being 3 for the column family which should have DFS replication of 1
