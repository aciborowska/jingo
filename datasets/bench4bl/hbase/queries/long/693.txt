After HADOOP-3472, MapFile.getClosest(.., ..., true) gives the correct value.
In the unit test, we have 
10
20
30
35 <== deleted
40 
in the MapFile. so in HStore.java's rowAtOrBeforeFromMapFile(MapFile.reader, bytes, ...)
readkey = (HStoreKey)map.getClosest(searchKey, readval, true);
it gets the deleted key 35. So it can not be added into candidateKeys.
The next key is 40, which is after the search key 38. So, we ends up 
with empty candidateKeys. Therefore, we lastKey() is null. cause TestGet2.java
line 236 failed with NPE.
Since MapFile.Reader has no prev(key) method, not sure what's the best
to do in HStore.java.
