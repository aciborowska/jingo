If we upgrade to JUnit 4.x we can get access to @BeforeClass annotations... that allows us to start up DFS & Hbase only once per test class.  This should improve the speed of our unit tests substantially.
We will also need an ability to reset the hbase state between tests however.  Drop all tables for example.
