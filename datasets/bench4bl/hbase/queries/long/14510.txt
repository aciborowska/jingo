I was able to set coprocessors for table by shell normally, but it didn't worked now.
Here's the shell output (omit really jar path and coprocessor classname)ï¼š



HBase Shell; enter 'help<RETURN>' for list of supported commands.

Type "exit<RETURN>" to leave the HBase Shell

I checked the recent commits and found HBASE-14224 is related to. It's an important improvement, but made a mistake in alter() of admin.rb, line 587. As the value is coprocess spec string but not only class name, here should use htd.setCoprocessorWithSpec instead of htd.setCoprocessor.
