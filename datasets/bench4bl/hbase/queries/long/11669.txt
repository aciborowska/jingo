HMaster uses the same port with the HRegionServer.
In the constructor of HMaster, it has to run super(conf, csm) which is HRegionServer. In this method, the rpc service is instantiated, and HMaster and HRegionServer will use the same rpc configuration. If users start the HMaster and HRegionServer in the same server, the error "Address already in use" occurs when HRegionServer starts up.
