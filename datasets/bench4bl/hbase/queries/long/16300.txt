in current master LruBlockCache,  CACHE_FIXED_OVERHEAD is calculated as this:



  public final static long CACHE_FIXED_OVERHEAD = ClassSize.align(

      (3 * Bytes.SIZEOF_LONG) + (10 * ClassSize.REFERENCE) +

      (5 * Bytes.SIZEOF_FLOAT) + (2 * Bytes.SIZEOF_BOOLEAN)

      + ClassSize.OBJECT);



after some investigation. I think there are some wrong here, class LruBlockCache, except static varible(which is belongs to class), there are 4 long varibles(maxBlockSize,maxSize,blockSize and overhead), 9 reference varibles and 2 boolean varibles, so the above code will not calculate LruBlockCache instance size correctly.
current related ut not failed mostly due to the result is 8 bytes aligned.
