Running latest trunk plus Jim's patch for HBASE-543: Setting 'info:server' to null in META does not reliably cause the master to reassign the region. I can see the meta scanner running, but no messages regarding 'info:server' being null. I wonder if the recent change to enable blockcache for ROOT and META has something to do with this.
