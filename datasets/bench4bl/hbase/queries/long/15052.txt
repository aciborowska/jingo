ReplicationSource is passing System.currentTimeMillis() to MetricsSource.setAgeOfLastShippedOp() which is subtracting that from EnvironmentEdgeManager.currentTime().



// if there was nothing to ship and it's not an error

// set "ageOfLastShippedOp" to <now> to indicate that we're current

metrics.setAgeOfLastShippedOp(System.currentTimeMillis(), walGroupId);



public void setAgeOfLastShippedOp(long timestamp, String walGroup) {

    long age = EnvironmentEdgeManager.currentTime() - timestamp;



 we should just use EnvironmentEdgeManager.currentTime() in ReplicationSource
