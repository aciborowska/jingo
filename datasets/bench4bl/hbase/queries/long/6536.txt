As we know in hbase 0.94.0 we have a configuration below
  <property>
    <name>hbase.regionserver.wal.enablecompression</name>
         <value>true</value>
  </property>
if we enable it in master cluster and disable it in slave cluster . Then replication will not work. It will throw unwrapRemoteException again and again in master cluster because slave can not parse the hlog entry buffer.
