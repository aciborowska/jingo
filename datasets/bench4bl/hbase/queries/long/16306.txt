I am working on adding Hybrid Logical clocks to HBase. As part of it, I wish to add TimestampType file in hbase common. Spark has some types defined in - org.apache.spark.sql.types, all of which are being imported. It also has a TimestampType defined. As currently in this file, all of the hbase common is imported, creating a namespace clash. I have changed to only import specific hbase common classes that are required in this file.
