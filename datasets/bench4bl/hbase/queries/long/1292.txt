I've been played with thrift recently, and observed an unexpected behavior: when getRow() encounters an non-existent row key, it throws an exception like this:
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'getRow failed: unknown result' in pear/thrift/packages/Hbase/Hbase.php:715
Stack trace:
#0 pear/thrift/packages/Hbase/Hbase.php(666): HbaseClient->recv_getRow()
#1 htdocs/hbase/DemoClient.php(174): HbaseClient->getRow('demo_table', '00100-XXXX')
#2 
{main}
 thrown in pear/thrift/packages/Hbase/Hbase.php on line 715
I would expect when we pass a non-existent key, it can throw something like NotFound (as in scanner) or one can test with RowResult.isEmpty() just like in java api.
