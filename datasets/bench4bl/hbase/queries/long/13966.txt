In table.jsp, for tables with very wide keys like URLs, the page can be very wide. On my own cluster, this page is 8 screens wide, almost un-usable.
Might be good to have a way to resize the columns, or wrap the long keys or truncate them, or anything else. When we want to look at the last colums, this is a big difficult.
