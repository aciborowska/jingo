Moved ./hbase-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/TestRegionServerMetrics.java  to  ../regionserver/TestRegionServerReadRequestMetrics.java.
I think it's great that these tests for checking metrics of a particular feature are contained in separate file.
If we put all metrics' tests in one file, it might become monolithic. The overhead of setting/destroying separate cluster (12-15 sec) doesn't seem much to me since we run multiple forks.
