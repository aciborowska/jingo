HBase dose not close a dead connection with the datanode.
This resulting in over 30K+ CLOSE_WAIT and at some point HBase can not connect to the datanode because too many mapped sockets from one host to another on the same port:50010. 
After I restart all RSs,  the count of CLOSE_WAIT will increase always.
$ netstat -an|grep CLOSE_WAIT|wc -l
2545

netstat -nap|grep CLOSE_WAIT|grep 6569|wc -l
2545
ps -ef|grep 6569

I aslo have reviewed these issues:
HBASE-9393
HDFS-5671
HDFS-1836
I found HBase 0.98/Hadoop 2.4.0 I uesed which source codes are not different from these patches.
But I donot understand why HBase 0.98/Hadoop 2.4.0 also have this isssue. Please check. Thanks a lot.
