Generally, regionserver automatically aborts when isHealth() returns false. But it sometimes got blocked while aborting. I saved the jstack and logs, and found out that it was caused by datanodes failures. The "regionserver60020" thread was blocked while closing WAL. 
This issue doesn't happen so frequently, but if it happens, it always leads to huge amount of requests failure. The only way to do is KILL -9.
I think it's a bug, but I haven't found a decent solution. Does anyone have the same problem?
