A few (Irfan on the list and jgray) report that a single node zk seems insufficient supporting small cluster < 20 nodes.  This seems odd (though, yeah, we're recommending serious deploys must have a quorum of >= 3 zk nodes).  Also, reports that all connections fill up and don't time out though job is done (on IRC).  Take a look.
(Check zk stat to see if it'll dump connections)
