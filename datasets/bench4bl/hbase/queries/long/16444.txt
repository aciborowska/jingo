Currently CellUtil#getSumOfCellKeyElementLengths() considers 



    return cell.getRowLength() + cell.getFamilyLength() +

    cell.getQualifierLength() +

    KeyValue.TIMESTAMP_TYPE_SIZE;



It can consider the 2 byte ROWLEN and 1 byte FAMILY_LEN also because with the current way of things we are sure how our key is structured.
But pls note that



    // This will be a low estimate.  Will do for now.

    return getSumOfCellKeyElementLengths(cell);



It says clearly it is going to be a low estimate. But in the write path there should be no harm in adding the complete KEY_INFRA_SIZE.
