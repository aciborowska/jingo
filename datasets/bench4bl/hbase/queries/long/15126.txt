HBaseFsck's checkRegionBoundaries function set the 'currentRegionBoundariesInformation.storesFirstKey'  was incorrect.I think it should be set like below,
currentRegionBoundariesInformation.storesFirstKey = keyOnly(storeFirstKey);
but current the 'currentRegionBoundariesInformation.storesFirstKey ' is just set to 'storeFirstKey',which will cause to comparator.compare(currentRegionBoundariesInformation.storesFirstKey,
            currentRegionBoundariesInformation.metaFirstKey)  get a wrong result.  Because it just compared the rowkey's length.
