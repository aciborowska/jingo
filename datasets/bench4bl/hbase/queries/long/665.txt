I have a large table.  If I create a scanner with a stop row near the beginning of the table, the last hasNext call hangs for a while.  If I do the same with the stop row near the end of the table, the last hasNext call is pretty quick.
I suspect that the server side scanner isn't terminating early, and is actually scanning through the whole table returning nothing.
