As part of the hollowing out of the old HBaseTestCase in preparation for removal, this patch purges the old Incommon trick that made it so you could pass an Interface to a method to do loading or testing and the implementation could be an HTable or a Region.  Instead, replace it with a RegionTable, a Regoin that has the Table Interface as a decoration so you can use same loading code and same test both on top of the Region or on other side of network via HTable.
