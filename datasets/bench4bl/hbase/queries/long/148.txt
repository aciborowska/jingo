Changes to TestCompaction introduced in hadoop-1768 passed an hudson build (#722) but reports on the hadoop irc have them failing on an an hp+ubuntu box:

cutting>	it's nothing fancy. /proc/cpuinfo shows "Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.20GHz".
<buenaventura>	Thats single-cpu...
<cutting>	yep
<cutting>	1GB of ram. bog standard pc.
<cutting>	running java 5, not java 6, if that matters.


(Failed also w/ java6).
The assertion that fails is count of row versions after a compaction and flush.  There are usually 4 – the 3 from stores and one that is in a flush that happened 'concurrent' to the compaction – but there can be 3 only (the maximum for a column) if non-intuitively the compaction thread starts after the flush finishes which can happen with certain jvm schedulers (hudson is one such).
I commented out the assertions to get the build working again.  This issue is about adding them back in again in a manner that has them working on hudson and the bog-standard hp+ubuntu.
