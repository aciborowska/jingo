We have seen in the tests through the IntegrationTestRSGroup that we may miss assigning a region. 
It is a simple logic error here: 



        if (server != null && !assignments.containsKey(server)) {

          assignments.put(server, new ArrayList<HRegionInfo>());

        } else if (server != null) {

           assignments.get(server).add(region);

         } else {



in the first condition, we are not adding the region to the newly created ArrayList.
