Noticed out public client.Future interface extends Netty, which means our public API is bound to a specific Netty API and release. IIRC we were minimizing our public-facing surface area and asserting ownership over the whole of it so as to control our compatibility. Ie, we've done this with Protobuf as well. Not sure if this has made it back to other branches.
