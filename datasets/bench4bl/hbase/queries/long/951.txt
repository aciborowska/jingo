When HMaster is called from the command line, don't try to issue a shutdown request if it is already in the process of shutting down.
The problem is that HBaseAdmin is trying to connect to the master, and the master has already shut down its server
threads, so it cannot respond to the HBaseAdmin.shutdown() request. 
It is harmless with respect to data retention/loss, but obviously annoying from the user's point of view.
HBaseAdmin trys to contact the master for HMaster -stop, but if the 
master is already shutting down, HBaseAdmin does not know that and keeps retrying as follows:
