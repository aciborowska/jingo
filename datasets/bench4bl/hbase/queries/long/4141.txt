Currently the DEBUG message looks like this:

2011-07-26 04:21:52,344 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.LruBlockCache: LRU Stats: total=3.24 MB, free=391.76 MB, max=395 MB, blocks=0, accesses=118458, hits=0, hitRatio=0.00%%, cachingAccesses=0, cachingHits=0, cachingHitsRatio=ï¿½%, evictions=0, evicted=0, evictedPerRun=NaN



Note the double percent on "hitRatio", and the stray character at "cachingHitsRatio".
The former is a added by the code in LruBlockCache.java:



...

"hitRatio=" +

  (stats.getHitCount() == 0 ? "0" : (StringUtils.formatPercent(stats.getHitRatio(), 2) + "%, ")) +

...



The StringUtils already adds a percent sign, so the trailing one here can be dropped.
The latter I presume is caused by the value not between 0.0 and 1.0. This should be checked and "NaN" or so displayed instead as is done for other values.
