Introduced by HBASE-14085. The problem is, for example, in hbase-common/pom.xml, we have
pom.xml


<plugin>

          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>

          <artifactId>maven-source-plugin</artifactId>

          <configuration>

            <excludeResources>true</excludeResources>

            <includes>

              <include>src/main/java</include>

              <include>${project.build.outputDirectory}/META-INF</include>

            </includes>

          </configuration>

        </plugin>



But in fact, the path inside <include> tag is relative to source directories, not the project directory. So the maven-source-plugin always end with

No sources in project. Archive not created.
