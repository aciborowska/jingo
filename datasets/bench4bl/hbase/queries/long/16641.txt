[INFO] --- maven-surefire-plugin:2.18.1:test (secondPartTestsExecution) @ hbase-client ---

[INFO] Tests are skipped.



The first part passed fine,  but second parts is skipped. 
Notice hbase-client/pom.xml 



 <executions>

          <execution>

            <id>secondPartTestsExecution</id>

            <phase>test</phase>

            <goals>

              <goal>test</goal>

            </goals>

            <configuration>

              <skip>true</skip>

            </configuration>

          </execution>

        </executions>



If i change the 'skip' to be false,  the second part could be triggered.  But this configuration existed for a long time,  is the cmd line on build box updated recently?
