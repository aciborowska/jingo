A few fellows have reported this issue.  I see it myself if I restart the cluster.   You'll see:



ZooKeeperWrapper: Failed to create out of safe mode in ZooKeeper: org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$NodeExistsException: KeeperErrorCode = NodeExists for /hbase/safe-mode



... over and over again in master log.
