HBASE-16423 added re-comparison feature to reduce false positive rate.
However, before logFailRowAndIncreaseCounter() is called, GOODROWS counter is not incremented. Neither is GOODROWS incremented when re-comparison passes.
This may produce inconsistent results across multiple runs of the same verifyrep command.
