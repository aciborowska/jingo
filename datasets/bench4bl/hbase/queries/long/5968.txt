I noticed that we are not doing html escaping for the rs/master web interfaces, so you can end up generating html like: 



<tr>

  <td>ci,,\xEEp/<T\xBE\xC0,1336471826990.fc5a943e75ce8521b1ccdaf72d2c96c8.</td>

  

  <td>

    <a href="hostname">hostname</a>

  </td>

  

  <td>,\xEEp/<T\xBE\xC0</td>

  <td>-n\xA8\xE0\x15\xDD\x80!</td>

  <td>2966724</td>

</tr>



This obviously does not render properly. 
Also, my crazy theory is that it can be a security risk. Since the region name is computed from table rows, which are most of the time user input. Thus if  the rows contain a "<script onload=" or similar, then that will be executed on the developer's browser having possibly access to dev environment.
