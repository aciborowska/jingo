In RsRPCServices.scan, most of IOE are thrown as a ScannerResetException, even when the hfile is corrupt or it cannot be found. The ClientScannr.loadCache will keep retrying when the exception is ScannerResetException. We could throw CorruptHFileException and FileNotFoundException directly from server and don't retry the scan in the client.
