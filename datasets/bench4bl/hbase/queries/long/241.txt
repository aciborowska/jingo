A mismatch in the code on the cluster revealed an infinite loop.  The .META. scanner is doing a socket timeout trying to contact a borked region server (The borked server was having trouble contacting hdfs because of of code version mismatch â€“ it was sort-of-working).  We retry the timeout up to the retry limit but then rather than try and redeploy the unreachable .META. we just drop back into scanning at the old location.... I'll attach a log that illustrates the goings-on.
I think this likely a trivial issue since it shouldn't really ever happen....
