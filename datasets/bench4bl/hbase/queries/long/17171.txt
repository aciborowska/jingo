Just noticed an odd error message that cropped up in some $dayjob internal testing.
Sometimes, executions of IntegrationTestTimeBoundedRequestsWithRegionReplicas would result in an error:

Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Please configure hbase.TimeBoundedMultiThreadedReader.runtime

  at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.test.IntegrationTestTimeBoundedRequestsWithRegionReplicas$TimeBoundedMultiThreadedReader.<init>



After digging into the test a bit more, I realized that this is actually failing because the remaining time left after the writers finish (that is, hbase.IntegrationTestTimeBoundedRequestsWithRegionReplicas.runtime minus the time the writers took) was negative. So, the test harness passed a value which always caused this error.
We should catch when the time available for the readers is negative and throw an appropriate error instructing the human to either increase the amount of time for hbase.IntegrationTestTimeBoundedRequestsWithRegionReplicas.runtime or decrease the amount of data written.
