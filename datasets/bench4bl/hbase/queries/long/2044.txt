The scope of HBASE-1822 was to remove deprecated APIs but some methods removed weren't even deprecated in the first place. For example from Scan:



-

-  /**

-   * Parses a combined family and qualifier and adds either both or just the 

-   * family in case there is not qualifier. This assumes the older colon 

-   * divided notation, e.g. "data:contents" or "meta:".

-   * <p>

-   * Note: It will through an error when the colon is missing.

-   * 

-   * @param familyAndQualifier

-   * @return A reference to this instance.

-   * @throws IllegalArgumentException When the colon is missing.

-   */

-  public Scan addColumn(byte[] familyAndQualifier) {

-    byte [][] fq = KeyValue.parseColumn(familyAndQualifier);

-    if (fq.length > 1 && fq[1] != null && fq[1].length > 0) {

-      addColumn(fq[0], fq[1]);  

-    } else {

-      addFamily(fq[0]);

-    }

-    return this;

-  }



There's more than 1 method and the same applies for Get. Also o.a.h.h.io.Cell was cleaned but not removed.
