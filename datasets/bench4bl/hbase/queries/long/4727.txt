Unconditionally deleting an UNASSIGNED ZNode when master processes RS2ZK_REGION_OPENED (from the toDo queue) for a region has caused multiply assigned regions or unassigned regions. One proposed fix is to check whether the ZNode is actually in the state RS2ZK_REGION_OPENED before deleting it. Another fix is to not delete the ZNode at all.
