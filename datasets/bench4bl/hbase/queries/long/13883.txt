65.7.2. MemStore Flush
A MemStore flush can be triggered under any of the conditions listed below. The minimum flush unit is per region, not at individual MemStore level.
 // SKIPPED
    3. When the number of WAL per region server reaches the value specified in hbase.regionserver.max.logs, MemStores from various regions will be flushed out to disk to reduce WAL count. The flush order is based on time. Regions with the oldest MemStores are flushed first until WAL count drops below hbase.regionserver.max.logs.

Section 3. requires clarification (reference to HBase version which supports this). Is it MultiWAL feature in 1.0?
