We just did some experiments on some larger clusters and found that while using IncreasingToUpperBoundRegionSplitPolicy generally works well and is very convenient, it does tend to produce too many regions.
Since the logic is - by design - local, checking the number of regions of the table in question on the local server only, we end with more regions then necessary.
