The Lars' import is a little messy; he's not sure how many records were imported.  Running a select takes a couple of hours.  He happens to have an idle MR cluster standing by.  An example MR job that just did a count of records would be generally useful.  Could even output row keys so you'd have a list of what made it in.   Later, if this tool becomes popular with derivatives and similiars, we can bundle a jar of MR jobs to run against your tables that can answer common queries and that are amenable to subclassing/modification.
