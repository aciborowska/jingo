perform the following opertions in HBase shell prompt.
1. create a table with one column family.
2. insert some amount of data into the table.
3. then perform increment operation on any column qualifier.
eg: incr 't', 'r1', 'f:c1'
4. then queried the get counter query,
it is throwing nocounter found message to the user.



eg:

 hbase(main):010:0> get_counter 't', 'r1', 'f', 'c1'

 No counter found at specified coordinates



=====================================================
and wrong message is throwing to user, while executing the get_counter query.



hbase(main):009:0> get_counter 't', 'r1', 'f'



ERROR: wrong number of arguments (3 for 4)



Here is some help for this command:

Return a counter cell value at specified table/row/column coordinates.

A cell cell should be managed with atomic increment function oh HBase

and the data should be binary encoded. Example:



  hbase> get_counter 'ns1:t1', 'r1', 'c1'

  hbase> get_counter 't1', 'r1', 'c1'



The same commands also can be run on a table reference. Suppose you had a reference

t to table 't1', the corresponding command would be:



  hbase> t.get_counter 'r1', 'c1'






problem:

   In example they given 3 arguments but asking 4 arguments

   If run with 3 arguments it will throw error.

   if run with 4 arguments "No counter found at specified coordinates" message is throwing even though counter is specified.
