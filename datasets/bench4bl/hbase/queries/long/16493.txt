ScanMetrics were introduced in the HBASE-4145. These metrics were able to work even in a parallel environment such as MapReduce.
The TableRecordReader creates a Scanner with a copy of the given "scan", called "currentScan". The ScanMetrics are captured by the Scanner and modifies the given Scan instance, "currentScan". The TableRecordReader, after reading the last value, updates the job counters to aggregate them. 
But since HBASE-13030, the TableRecordReader reads the scanMetrics from the object "scan" instead of using the "currentScan"
