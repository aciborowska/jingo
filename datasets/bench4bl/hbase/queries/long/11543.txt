            for (TableName tableName : tableNames) {

                admin.disableTable(tableName);

                admin.deleteTable(tableName);

            }

After the above, some systemspace table is messed up as the shell client won't function well anymore.
Same codes working fine in 0.98.3-hadoop1.
