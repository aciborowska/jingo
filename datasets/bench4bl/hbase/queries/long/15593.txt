In RSRpcServices.scan, we will set a time limit equaling to Math.min(scannerLeaseTimeoutPeriod, rpcTimeout) / 2, and will response heartbeat message if we reach this limit. However, two timeout settings (hbase.client.scanner.timeout.period and hbase.rpc.timeout) are read from RS's configure, which may be different from client's. If client's setting is much less than server's, there may still be timeout at client side.
