Looking at the hudson console logs, the region server with ROOT region went away.  Usually this is not the region server that goes down.  Its usually the one hosting other regions.  I noticed a while ago that we don't recover from this ROOT gone situation (where once we used to).  Chatting with Jim, a shutdown event gets queued and is supposed to be run after a 1/2 lease has expired.  I noticed that shutdown's getDelay always returned 1/2 a lease.  Reading DelayQueue, the queue will not return elements on poll unless the queue'd items getDelay returns a value of <= 0.
