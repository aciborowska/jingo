HBASE-11536 fixes a case where on a very rare occasion, the meta updates may be processed out of order. The fix is to use the RS's timestamp for the server column in meta update, but that actually opens up a vulnerability for clock skew (see the discussions in the jira). 
For the region replicas case, we can reproduce a problem where the server name field is eclipsed by the masters earlier update because the RS is lagging behind. However, this is not specific to replicas, but occurs more frequently with it. 
One option that was discussed was to send the master's ts with open region RPC and use it.
