If you have multiple masters, you should be able to kill the primary and have the backups assume control within seconds instead of having to wait the default 3mins before an ephemeral znode expires.  
The expected behavior is similar to how region servers when killed (not -9) trigger the servers shutdown handler and quickly pass of its regions for reassignment.  In this case, a master that is killed is removes the znode and allow another to become the primary.  A related follow on feature could be the ability to failover to another primary without taking the orignal primary down.
