I ran into this:
1. RegionServer started to split a region(R), but the split was taking a long time, and hence the split was aborted
2. As part of cleanup, the RS deleted the ZK node that it created initially for R
3. The master (AssignmentManager) noticed the node deletion, and made R offline
4. The RS recovered from the failure, and at some point of time, tried to do the split again.
5. The master got an event RS_ZK_REGION_SPLIT but the server gave an error like - "Received SPLIT for region R from server RS but it doesn't exist anymore,.."
6. The RS apparently did the split successfully this time, but is stuck on the master to delete the znode for the region. It kept on saying - "org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.SplitTransaction: Still waiting on the master to process the split for R" and it was stuck there forever.
