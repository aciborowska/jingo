After master-RS colocation, now the pseudo dist-mode does not work as documented since you cannot start a region server in the same port 16020. 
I think we can either select a random port (and info port) for the master's region server, or document how to do a pseudo-distributed setup in the book. 
Jimmy Xiang wdyt?
