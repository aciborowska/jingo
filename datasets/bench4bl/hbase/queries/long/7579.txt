HTableDescriptor's compareTo function compares a set of HColumnDescriptors against another set of HColumnDescriptors. It iterates through both, relying on the fact that they will be in the same order.
In my testing, I may have seen this issue come up, so I decided to fix it.
It's a straightforward fix. I convert the sets into a hashset for O(1) lookups (at least in theory), then I check that all items in the first set are found in the second.
Since the sizes are the same, we know that if all elements showed up in the second set, then they must be equal.
