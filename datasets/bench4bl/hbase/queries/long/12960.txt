I've just downloaded and unzipped hbase 0.99.2 and tried to run this command:



C:\hbase-0.99.2\bin>hbase shell

Invalid maximum heap size: -Xmx1000m "

Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.

Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.



The command is documented here:
http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#_get_started_with_hbase
The problem is in hbase.cmd on line 296



set HEAP_SETTINGS="%JAVA_HEAP_MAX% %JAVA_OFFHEAP_MAX%"



The quotes should be stripped:



set HEAP_SETTINGS=%JAVA_HEAP_MAX% %JAVA_OFFHEAP_MAX%
