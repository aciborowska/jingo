I can't get HBase trunk to build. In particular TestHCM.testClusterStatus always fails for me. I tried on my own Jenkins as well as my IDE (IntelliJ) with the same result (two different machines, CentOS & Mac OS).
mvn -U -PrunAllTests -Dmaven.test.redirectTestOutputToFile=true
-Dit.test=noItTest clean install
I've attached the full log. It fails on the last wait by exceeding the timeout. This is reported:



 - Thread LEAK? -, OpenFileDescriptor=417 (was 440), MaxFileDescriptor=4096 (was 4096), SystemLoadAverage=227 (was 265), ProcessCount=243 (was 240) - ProcessCount LEAK? -, AvailableMemoryMB=2196 (was 1991) - AvailableMemoryMB LEAK? -, ConnectionCount=7 (was 6) - ConnectionCount LEAK? -



And the Thread dump (see attached file) has a bunch of things reported as potentially hanging threads.
From my MacBook's command line I got the test to pass using the same
command but not in Jenkins or from IntelliJ.
