HConnectionImplementation creates a ZooKeeperKeepAliveConnection during construction, but if the constructor throw a exception, the zookeeper connection is not properly closed. 



HConnectionImplementation(Configuration conf, boolean managed,

        ExecutorService pool, User user) throws IOException {

      this(conf);

      this.user = user;

      this.batchPool = pool;

      this.managed = managed;

      this.registry = setupRegistry();

      retrieveClusterId(); //here is the zookeeper connection created

        this.rpcClient = RpcClientFactory.createClient(this.conf, this.clusterId);// In our case, the exception happens here, so the zookeeper connection never closes

        this.rpcControllerFactory = RpcControllerFactory.instantiate(conf);

        ......
