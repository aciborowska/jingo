Looking at the failures in the last two nightlies.
Looking at #258, the test that failed was same as reported in HADOOP-1964 but mode is this time different.  The ROOT scanner keeps running but the META has disappeared with a log emission.

Jim's HADOOP-1966 has changed how things work significantly enough that am going to pass on further analysis of this failure.
On #259, Jim has handle on two of the three failed tests.  I'm looking at the TestDFSAbort...
