When a new cluster is started, it creates a temporary WAL as hbase:meta is created during bootstrapping the system. Then this log is closed before properly opened on a region server. The temp WAL file is scheduled for removal, moved to oldWALs and eventually claimed. Issue is that the WAL directory with the temp region is not removed. For example:

drwxr-xr-x   - hadoop hadoop          0 2015-05-28 10:21 /hbase/WALs/hregion-65589555



The directory is empty and does not harm, but on the other hand it is not needed anymore and should be removed. Cosmetic and good housekeeping.
