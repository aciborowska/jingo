HBASE-10015 has some lengthy discussion. The solution there ended up replacing synchronized with ReentrantLock, which - somewhat surprisingly - yielded a non-trivial improvement for tall tables.
The goal should be to avoid locking in StoreScanner at all. StoreScanner is only accessed by a single thread except when we have a concurrent flush or a compaction, which is rare (we'd acquire and release the lock millions of times per second, and compact/flush a few time an hour at the most).
