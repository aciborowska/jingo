Currently MultiGets are executed on a RegionServer in a single thread in a loop that handles each Get separately (opening a scanner, seeking, etc).
It seems we could optimize this (per region at least) by opening a single scanner and issue a reseek for each Get that was requested.
I have not tested this yet and no patch, but I would like to solicit feedback on this idea.
