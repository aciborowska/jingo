Currently we do call KeyValueScanner.shipped() if the size of the KVs compacted reaches certain threshold



     if (kvs != null && bytesWrittenProgressForShippedCall > shippedCallSizeLimit) {

            kvs.shipped();

            bytesWrittenProgressForShippedCall = 0;

}



Where the shippedCallSizeLimit is



    long shippedCallSizeLimit = (long) minFilesToCompact * HConstants.DEFAULT_BLOCKSIZE;



Instead it is better if it is based on the actual configured block size for that store. It can still have the multiplying factore of 'minFilesToCompact ' but having default store size would mean that if the store has smaller block sizes configured we hold on to more blocks and those will not get evicted.
