This JIRA was created to add @Test tag for all the filter related tests. After doing that one such test failed in TestFilterList#testFilterListTwoFiltersMustPassOne.
The test assumes that when a PrefixFilter is added to a filterlist once the given prefix is passed we should SKIP all other rows. But the impl in FilterList for MUST_PASS_ONE filter is such that once the filter in the list sees that filterAllRemaining is true we don't use that to decide if to to SEE_NEXT_USING_HINT or not. This patch tries to handle that case where if for a filter FilterAllRemaining is true then SEEK_NEXT_USING_HINT need not be done.
