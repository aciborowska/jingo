Use two level of caching to improve read performance


Scan cache
	
Higher-level cache
		
Caches the K,V pairs returned by the SSTable(HStore?) interface to the region server code


Most useful for applications that tend to read the same data repeatedly




Block cache
	
Lower-level cache
		
Caches SSTables blocks that were read from HDFS


Useful for applications that read data close to the data that they recently read
		
E.g. Sequential read or random read of different column in same locality group within a hot row
