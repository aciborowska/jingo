As Ben Sutton reported in the thread, Slow response on HBase REST api using globbing option, query through the Rest API with a globbing option i.e. http://<HBase_Rest>:<HBase_Rest_Port>/table/key* executes extremely slowly.
Jerry He pointed out that PrefixFilter is used for query involving globbing option.
This issue is to fix this bug by setting start row for such queries.
