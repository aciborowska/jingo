This is on branch-1 based code only.
Here's the sequence of events.

A regionserver opens a new region. That regions looks like it should split.
So the regionserver starts a split transaction.
Split transaction starts execute
Split transaction encounters an error in stepsBeforePONR
Split transaction starts rollback
Split transaction notifies master that it's rolling back using HMasterRpcServices#reportRegionStateTransition
AssignmentManager#onRegionTransition is called with SPLIT_REVERTED
AssignmentManager#onRegionSplitReverted is called.
That onlines the parent region and offlines the daughter regions.

However the daughter regions were never created in meta so all that gets done is that state for those rows gets OFFLINE. Now all clients trying to get the parent instead get the offline daughter.
