Looking at the 0.92 master logs, I see I often get this message:
WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.AssignmentManager: Node deleted but still in RIT: TestTable,blah. state=OPEN, ts=1318369648361, server=blah
The issue seems to be due to a race between OpenedRegionHandler and watchers in AssignmentManager. Specifically, ORH first deletes the znode then deletes the in-memory RIT data structure (via regionOnline). Between the two steps a watcher is triggered and if it arrives first then it will see the region still in RIT.
If the message is really supposed to be a warning then in the current form it's useless as people will see this message 99% of the time because of this race.
