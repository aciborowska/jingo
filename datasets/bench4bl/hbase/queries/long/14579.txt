That's the HBase version of HADOOP-10683.
We see:
hbase.Server (RpcServer.java:saslReadAndProcess(1446)) - Auth successful for securedUser/localhost@EXAMPLE.COM (auth:SIMPLE)
while we would like to see:
hbase.Server (RpcServer.java:saslReadAndProcess(1446)) - Auth successful for securedUser/localhost@EXAMPLE.COM (auth:KERBEROS)
The fix is simple, but it means we need hadoop 2.5+. 
There is also a lot of cases where HBase calls "createUser" w/o specifying the authentication method... I don"'t have the solution for these ones.
