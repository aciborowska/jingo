We are still using org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapred.TableInputFormat (as opposed to org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TableInputFormat) for Hadoop Streaming integration. We need to add startRow/endRow support to TableInputFormat due to a product requirement. However, the two TableInputFormat implementations have diverged over time. We need to make mapred.TableInputFormat reuse some of the newer code in mapreduce.TableInputFormat, and add startRow/endRow support to it.
