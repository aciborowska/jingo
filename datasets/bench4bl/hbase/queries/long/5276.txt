Note: This was discovered running the CDH version hbase-0.90.4-cdh3u2
Running the PerformanceEvaluation as follows:
  $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop org.apache.hadoop.hbase.PerformanceEvaluation scan 5
fails because the MR tasks do not get the HBase jar on the CP, and thus hit ClassNotFoundExceptions.
The job gets the following only:
file:/Users/tim/dev/hadoop/hbase-0.90.4-cdh3u2/hbase-0.90.4-cdh3u2-tests.jar
file:/Users/tim/dev/hadoop/hadoop-0.20.2-cdh3u2/hadoop-core-0.20.2-cdh3u2.jar
file:/Users/tim/dev/hadoop/hbase-0.90.4-cdh3u2/lib/zookeeper-3.3.3-cdh3u2.jar
The RowCounter etc all work because they live in the HBase jar, not the test jar, and they get the following 
file:/Users/tim/dev/hadoop/hbase-0.90.4-cdh3u2/lib/guava-r06.jar
file:/Users/tim/dev/hadoop/hadoop-0.20.2-cdh3u2/hadoop-core-0.20.2-cdh3u2.jar
file:/Users/tim/dev/hadoop/hbase-0.90.4-cdh3u2/hbase-0.90.4-cdh3u2.jar
file:/Users/tim/dev/hadoop/hbase-0.90.4-cdh3u2/lib/zookeeper-3.3.3-cdh3u2.jar
Presumably this relates to 
  job.setJarByClass(PerformanceEvaluation.class);
  ...
  TableMapReduceUtil.addDependencyJars(job);
A (cowboy) workaround to run PE is to unpack the jars, and copy the PerformanceEvaluation* classes building a patched jar.
