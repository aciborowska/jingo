I've been fighting with getting master to import/build normally inside of Eclipse (a bit seems to have come in as a part of the shaded protocol work).
Once thing I see definitely wrong is that Eclipse is balking at the source files being compiled in target/ instead of target/classes. This looks like an omission since there is no good reason to not use the standard convention of target/classes.
