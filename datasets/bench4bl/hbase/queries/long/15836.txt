Carter Shanklin noticed the following:



$ hbase backup create

ERROR: wrong number of arguments

Usage: hbase backup create <type> <backup_root_path> [tables] [-s name] [-convert] [-silent] [-w workers][-b bandwith]

 type          "full" to create a full backup image;

               "incremental" to create an incremental backup image

  backup_root_path   The full root path to store the backup image,

                    the prefix can be hdfs, webhdfs or gpfs

 Options:

  tables      If no tables ("") are specified, all tables are backed up. Otherwise it is a

               comma separated list of tables.

 -s name     Use the specified snapshot for full backup

 -convert    For an incremental backup, convert WAL files to HFiles

 -w          number of parallel workers.

 -b          bandwith per one worker (in MB sec)



A working backup command may look like the following (assuming the set named green exists):



sudo -u hbase hbase backup create full hdfs://ip:8020/tmp/backup -set green



Help text for backup command should be updated.
