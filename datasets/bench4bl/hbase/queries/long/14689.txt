One of our customers ran into HBASE-13471, which resulted in all the handlers getting blocked and various other issues. While backporting the issue, I noticed that there is one more case where we might go into infinite loop. In case a row lock cannot be acquired (due to a previous leak for example which we have seen in Phoenix before) this will cause similar infinite loop.
