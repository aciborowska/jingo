In Cell interface (hbase-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/Cell.java),
we have the following comment for "value"



  /**

   * Contiguous raw bytes that may start at any index in the containing array. Max length is

   * Integer.MAX_VALUE which is 2,147,483,648 bytes.

   * @return The array containing the value bytes.

   */



Integer.MAX_VALUE is not 2,147,483,648 (2^31), but 2,147,483,647 (2^31-1)
