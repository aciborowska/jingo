From a code perusal by Tom White:

...
1. In Memcache.internalGet the following line doesn't seem to do anything.

curKey.setVersion(itKey.getTimestamp() - 1);

So why have curKey at all? Am I missing something?

2. Hashcode for HStoreKey (and others) uses the form Long.valueOf(...)
for long fields. This creates an object each time - not sure if it's a
problem (probably isn't) but as you've been doing some profiling I
thought I'd mention it.
