Currently when ever a chunk is created either out of chunk pool or directly we add it to chunkQueue. In case of chunkPool available adding to chunkQueue makes sense. Else there is no need to add it to the chunkQueue as there is no one who is going to clear the queue. So after a point the chunks that are created directly are just going to be dropped without adding to queue.
