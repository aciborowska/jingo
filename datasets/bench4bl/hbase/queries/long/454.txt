I have a java tools server that uses some hbase client functionality (it is a servlet: in doGet I create a new HTable and call HTable.get).  However, if I restart hbase, then subsequent hbase calls take forever.  To fix it, I have to restart my java tools server.
I suspect it is caching the old location of .META., and can't deal with the cache being wrong.
