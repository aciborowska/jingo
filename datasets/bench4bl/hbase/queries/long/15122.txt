In our JMXJsonServlet we are doing this:
        jsonpcb = request.getParameter(CALLBACK_PARAM);
        if (jsonpcb != null) {
          response.setContentType("application/javascript; charset=utf8");
          writer.write(jsonpcb + "(");
... 
Findbugs complains rightly. There are other instances in our servlets and then there are the pages generated by jamon excluded from findbugs checking (and findbugs volunteers that it is dumb in this regard finding only the most egregious of violations).
We have no sanitizing tooling in hbase that I know of (correct me if I am wrong). I started to pull on this thread and it runs deep. Our Jamon templating (last updated in 2013 and before that, in 2011) engine doesn't seem to have sanitizing means either and there seems to be outstanding XSS complaint against jamon that goes unaddressed.
Could pull in something like https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Encoder_Project and run all emissions via it or get a templating engine that has sanitizing built in.
