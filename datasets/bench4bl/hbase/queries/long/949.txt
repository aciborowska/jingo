HBase needs a Manual.  Manual can be checked in under docs and evolve as hbase does (Hopefully we get to a state where new feature can't be closed unless manual has been updated to include mention and howto).  Let this issue be about adding under docs an outline with some basic getting started info.  Thereafter, we can open individual issues to add "chapters" or topics.
Made it a blocker on 0.20.0.
