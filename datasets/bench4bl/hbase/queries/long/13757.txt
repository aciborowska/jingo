I recently backported a bunch of changes to the Canary to 0.98, and as a standalone daemon it tested out ok. On HBASE-13712 the reviewer and I mistook precommit failures for an ASF Jenkins botch but several test failures were legitimate because HBaseTestingUtility calls the static method Canary#sniff, and this use stopped working correctly. Fixing the test failures here.
