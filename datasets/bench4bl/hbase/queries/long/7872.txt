I see that the constructor: public Delete(byte [] row, long timestamp, RowLock rowLock) was deprecated, but the following was also deprecated with a partial comment that looks like a copy/paste error, no?
  /**

Create a Delete operation for the specified row and timestamp.<p>
   *
If no further operations are done, this will delete all columns in all
families of the specified row with a timestamp less than or equal to the
specified timestamp.<p>
   *
This timestamp is ONLY used for a delete row operation.  If specifying
families or columns, you must specify each timestamp individually.
@param row row key
@param timestamp maximum version timestamp (only for delete row)
@param rowLock previously acquired row lock, or null
