When creating a new replication peer the ReplicationSourceManager enqueues the currently open HLog to the ReplicationSource to ship to the destination cluster.  The ReplicationSource starts at the beginning of the HLog and ships over any pre-existing writes.
A workaround is to roll all the HLogs before enabling replication.
A little background for how it affected us - we were migrating one cluster in a master-master pair.  I.e. transitioning from A <-> B to B <-> C.  After shutting down writes from A -> B we enabled writes from C -> B.  However, this replicated some earlier writes that were in C's HLogs that had originated in A.  Since we were running a version of HBase before HBASE-7709 those writes then got caught in a infinite replication cycle and bringing down region servers OOM because of HBASE-9865.
However, in general, if one wants to manage what data gets replicated, one wouldn't expect that potentially very old writes would be included when setting up a new replication link.
