When looking at the parameters used by compaction algorithm in http://hbase.apache.org/book/regions.arch.html, we found there is typo.
In hbase code, the config key for compaction ratio is hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio.
But in the hbase book it's hbase.store.compaction.ratio.
CompactSelection.java#66



    this.conf = conf;

    this.compactRatio = conf.getFloat("hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio", 1.2F);

    this.compactRatioOffPeak = conf.getFloat("hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio.offpeak", 5.0F);



Just fix it to avoid misleading.
