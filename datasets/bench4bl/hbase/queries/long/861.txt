When an explicit timestamp is specified, no results should be returned if there is no value stored at that timestamp.
A value should be returned (as it currently is) if the timestamp is defaulted or is LATEST_TIMESTAMP (which is the same thing). This works correctly.
Table name "web", columns: "contents:", "anchor:"
store com.cnn.www/contents:/5 value = "t5"
store com.cnn.www/anchor:my.look.ca:/8 value = "CNN.com"
com.cnn.www/anchor:cnnsi.com/9 value = "CNN"
get(com.cnn.www/contents:/8) should return nothing but returns value="t5", timestamp=5
get(com.cnn.www/anchor:my.look.ca:/9) should return nothing, but returns value="CNN.com", timestamp=8
