You can't shutdown regionservers from the commandline:
durruti:~/Documents/checkouts/hadoop-trunk/src/contrib/hbase stack$ ./bin/hbase regionserver stop
There is no regionserver stop mechanism. To stop regionservers, shutdown the hbase master
The above was done intentionally to scare folks toward shutting down clusters from the master.
But, as Paul Saab points out, if a server is errant, you'll want to be able to shut it down gracefully.
Enable individual regionserver shutdown from command line and optionally from the UI.
