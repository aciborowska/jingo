We found NPE in our 0.98 production cluster because RegionServerCoprocessorHost is not initialized before RpcServer start service.



      // Try and register with the Master; tell it we are here.  Break if

      // server is stopped or the clusterup flag is down or hdfs went wacky.

      while (keepLooping()) {

        RegionServerStartupResponse w = reportForDuty();

        if (w == null) {

          LOG.warn("reportForDuty failed; sleeping and then retrying.");

          this.sleeper.sleep();

        } else {

          handleReportForDutyResponse(w);

          break;

        }

      }



      // Initialize the RegionServerCoprocessorHost now that our ephemeral

      // node was created by reportForDuty, in case any coprocessors want

      // to use ZooKeeper

      this.rsHost = new RegionServerCoprocessorHost(this, this.conf);



RpcServer start service in handleReportForDutyResponse(), then it can serve rpc call replicateWALEntry(). But the RegionServerCoprocessorHost is not initialized and it is used in replicateWALEntry, so it will throw a NPE.
