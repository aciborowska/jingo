Carter Shanklin reported the following:
This backup path and ID exist. When an existing table name is used:



[vagrant@hdp250-hbase ~]$ sudo -u hbase hbase restore /tmp/backup_incremental $FULL_BACKUP_ID TEST_DATA

2016-05-10 18:05:22,380 ERROR [main] impl.RestoreClientImpl: Existing table found in the restore target, please add "-overwrite" option in the command if you mean to restore to these existing tables

2016-05-10 18:05:22,380 INFO  [main] impl.RestoreClientImpl: Existing table list in restore target: [TEST_DATA]

2016-05-10 18:05:22,380 ERROR [main] impl.RestoreClientImpl: ERROR: restore failed with error: Existing table found in target while no "-overwrite" option found

java.io.IOException: Existing table found in target while no "-overwrite" option found



If I use a table name that doesn't exist I get this:



[vagrant@hdp250-hbase ~]$ sudo -u hbase hbase restore /tmp/backup_incremental $FULL_BACKUP_ID fda

java.io.IOException: Could not find backup manifest for backup_1462900212093 in /tmp/backup_incremental



The error message suggests there is some manifest file under /tmp/backup_incremental/backup_1462900212093 and that probably this directory backup_1462900212093 doesn't exist. Looking at the code, it is actually drilling down into a table at this point which is not obvious to me.
If the message said something like "could not find backup manifest (.backup.manifest) for table X within /base/path" I think this would be a lot easier to diagnose.
