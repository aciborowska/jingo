Add the tests that were added by parent issue HBASE-15158; adds IncrementPerformanceTest, TestRegionIncrement, and moves Increment testing 'from client side' out into own test suite. This stuff is mostly forward-post of tests  committed to branch-1 to test increment regressions 'narorow' fix (See HBASE-15031). We are adding the tests separately here in an effort at making the HBASE-15158 patch smaller. This is preamble 2 of 2. Preamble 1 was HBASE-15186
