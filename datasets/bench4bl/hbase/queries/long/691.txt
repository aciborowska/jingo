From the list, cure at xg dot pl

    there are group of methods "getRow" and group "getScanner" - both get as param array of collumns
    but in "getRow" methods we have to put it without ":" at the end of column family name, and for "getScanner" the colon is necessary.
    i think that it will be good to make it identical.
