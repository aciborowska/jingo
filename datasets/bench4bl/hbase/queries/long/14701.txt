This test has failed twice in last 24 hours. I removed it from master for now over in HBASE-14678.  It fails a lot. See here: https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK/6962/testReport/history/  It recently got refactored to remove a bunch of duplicated code.  Assigning to Jingcheng Du to take a look if you have a chance please. Otherwise, unassign. Thanks.
