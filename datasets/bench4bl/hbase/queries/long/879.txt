Since the hbase regionservers use a DFSClient to keep handles open to the dfs, if the dfs blocks move around (typically because of a dfs restart, but can also happen if datanodes die or blocks get shuffled around), the regionserver will be unable to service the region.  It would be nice if the DFSClient that the regionservers use could notice this case and refresh the block list.
