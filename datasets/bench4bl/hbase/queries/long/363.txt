The existing scanner interface excludes the end key from the result range. If you actually want to do an inclusive scan for some reason, you would currently have to guess at the key immediately after the end key, which is a shoddy solution. 
A new stoprow filter could be created that stops at the end key but also returns it. Then, you could supply an extra parameter to getScanner to say you want an inclusive scan.
