Here is related code:



          ResultScanner targetScanner = targetTable.getScanner(scan);

          for (Result row : targetScanner) {

            targetHasher.hashResult(row);          

          }

        } // else current batch ends exactly at split end row



targetScanner should be closed upon leaving the if block.
