SystemUtils currently only knows about the "consumer" versions of Windows, however there are also the Server-Variants, which can be detected separatedely. E.g. in my case I would like to detect a Windows Server 2003 instance, but cannot, as it is not detected by any of the existing IS_OS_WINDOWS_xxx variants.
I extracted the following values that can be used to detect these versions:

Windows Server 2003 R2: os.name=Windows 2003, os.version=5.2
Windows Server 2008 R2: os.name=Windows Server 2008 R2, os.version=6.1
