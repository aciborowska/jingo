DurationFormatUtils does not document the format string fully.
It currently only mentions the individual formatting characters.
It does not mention how repeated characters are handled, nor does it mention quoting.
It does not state whether characters that are not (currently) format 
characters need to be quoted (at present these are assumed to be text).
