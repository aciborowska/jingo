Enum uses no synchronization. Even if you assume that instances are only declared statically, the cEnumClasses map is global and can be written to when a thread triggers static initialization of B.class while some other thread is doing getEnumList(A.class). Unsynchronized access of a map undergoing mutation is not thread-safe.
This isn't theoretical. We're seeing ValuedEnum.getEnum(X.class, 0) return null after returning the correct value over 100,000 times, and then return the correct value again on the next invocation.
