There are a few "Multiple sources of package comments found" warnings and one for commons-collections linkage in commons-lang svn, will attach a patch.
By the way, I'm wondering why the javadocs for the org.apache.commons.lang3.compare package are not visible at http://commons.apache.org/lang/api-release/ ; they are there if I build javadocs locally from svn.
