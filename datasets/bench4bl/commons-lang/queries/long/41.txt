My expectations for the behavior of the split( *, ..., int max ) methods don't
match their actual behavior.  I expected to get a maximum of "max" substrings,
all of which were delimited in the parent string by the specified delimiters. 
Instead, what you get is "max - 1" such substrings, plus the rest of the parent
string as the final result substring.  This behavior seems counter to what
StringTokenizer would do, which is surprising, given the Javadoc comments about
using the split methods as alternatives to StringTokenizer.
