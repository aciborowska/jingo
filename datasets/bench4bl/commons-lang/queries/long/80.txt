I propose the following new interface CharacterEncodingNames. I've stored a
proposal in CVS to "record" it. Even if we nuke it, it will be in the "Attic".
In short:
/**

Character encoding names required of every implementation of the Java platform.

According to the Java documentation <a
 *
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/lang/package-summary.html#charenc">JRE
character encoding names</a>:
<p>
<cite>Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
following character encodings. Consult the
release documentation for your implementation to see if any other encodings
are supported. </cite>
</p>
