When a set of characters is supplied to RandomStringUtils.random(), the last
character in the set never appears in generated strings.  
Attaching patch and test case showing failure.
The test case generates 100 6-character strings from a 3-character set and
compares the observed frequency of occurrence of each of the characters in the
set with expectation assuming purely random selection.  Uses a chi-square test.
