The javadoc for DateUtils.iterator() seems to say that the iterator returned
will only have two dates: the start date and the end date. If it iterates over
more dates, which interval is use: hour, day, week or something else?
"For instance, passing Thursday, July 4, 2002 and a RANGE_MONTH_SUNDAY will
return an Iterator that starting with Sunday, June 30, 2002 iterates over every
day (at midnight) until with Saturday, August 3, 2002."
Also the Date version of the method does not say that the iterator returns
Calendar and not Date as I would have expected given the method signature.
