If you use EqualsBuilder.append(Object[], Object[]), and the first array contains an element that is null 
(and before any other mismatches between the arrays are present), then EqualsBuilder will throw a 
NullPointerException at line 513.
Steps to reproduce:
  Object[] x1 = new Object[] 
{ new Integer(1), null, new Integer(3) }
;
  Object[] x2 = new Object[] 
{ new Integer(1), new Integer(2), new Integer(3) }
;
  new EqualsBuilder().append(x1, x2);
The third line of this program will crash.
Attached is a patch that fixes this bug and adds code to an existing unit-test case that proves it's fixed 
(i.e., the test fails without the source patch, and passes with it, and is a valid test).
This patch also fixes another bug related to exact types of objects in an array (which I'm about to enter, 
and which I will relate to this bug if I figure out how .
