DurationFormatUtils assumes that the the number of days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds can be expressed as an int when converted from a long duration in milliseconds.
However even the number of days can exceed an int if the duration is large enough.
It's unlikely that such large durations will often be used, but this restriction is not documented. It should be easy enough to use long fields instead of int.
