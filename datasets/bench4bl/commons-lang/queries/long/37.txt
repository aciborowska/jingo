I hate to put a damper on things so late in the game but Clover reports
that we have 0% code coverage for three new 2.1 classes
(MappedMessageFormat, StrBuilder, StrTokenizer.StringMatcher) in the new

Sadly, this makes the coverage for this new package the lowest % in all
of [lang].
Did someone forget to commit unit tests? This surely must be an omission
of some kind. I cannot see us releasing without unit tests for this new
code.

Attached is the start of a unit test for StrBuilder.  Sorry it is not complete â€“ I ran out of steam.
