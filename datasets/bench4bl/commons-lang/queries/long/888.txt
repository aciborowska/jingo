You hava a spring MVC site, it's support multiple languages. 
You can try url is http://xxx.com/controll/action?locale=pt_pt, it's think so "There is definitely a variant, and it is everything after the country"
form code:
org.springframework.util.StringUtils.parseLocaleString[659]
if (parts.length >= 2) {
			// There is definitely a variant, and it is everything after the country
			// code sans the separator between the country code and the variant.
			int endIndexOfCountryCode = localeString.indexOf(country) + country.length();
			// Strip off any leading '_' and whitespace, what's left is the variant.
			variant = trimLeadingWhitespace(localeString.substring(endIndexOfCountryCode));
			if (variant.startsWith("_")) 
{

				variant = trimLeadingCharacter(variant, '_');

			}
		}
		return (language.length() > 0 ? new Locale(language, country, variant) : null);
When locale is "pt_pt", it's result "pt_PT_pt", I think so it's not a variant.
