I've noticed the Javadocs include links to methods with spaces incorrectly encoded. For example, the Javadocs for DateUtils describes a method:



public static boolean isSameDay(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2)



The link to this is:

[...]/DateUtils.html#isSameDay(java.util.Calendar, java.util.Calendar)



whereas it should be:

[...]/DateUtils.html#isSameDay(java.util.Calendar,%20java.util.Calendar)



Not sure what's causing this problem. But it certainly hinders efforts to link to our docs from other sites (like Stack Overflow).
