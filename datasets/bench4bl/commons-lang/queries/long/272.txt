Attaching a patch for minor changes to the build:
1) Change project.properties so that the source distro unpacks to a different directory
2) Include checkstyle.properties and all the RELEASE-NOTES files in the source distro
3) Remove the exclusion of the "text" package from the source distro
4) Include the NOTICE.txt in the maven generated binary distro (and jar)
Althought the ant build is used to create the binary distro in the release process - I still think the maven generated binary distro should include the NOTICE.txt
Also attaching a patch to clean up the few minor checkstyle issues.
