The API for StrLookup is confused. The class has been partly genericised, but why?
The Javadoc says the class is for looking up Strings which are indexed by Strings, and this agrees with the method lookup()
Surely if the class is generic on <V>, the lookup() method should return V, not String?
Does it make any sense for the class to return anything but a String? If not, then why is the class generic?
If it does make sense, then lookup() should return V.
