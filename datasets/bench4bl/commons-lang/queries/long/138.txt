When values of ValuedEnum are defined as final (as the JavaDoc suggests),
then all classes that use this enum will hold the value itself and not reference
after compilation. Compiler substitutes references to final with the value of
final variable itself. Then if you change the value in you enum and recompile 
it, you must recompile also all the classes that use the enum. Otherwise they 
continue to use old value.
