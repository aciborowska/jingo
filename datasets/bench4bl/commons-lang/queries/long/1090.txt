FastDateParser#parse(String,ParsePosition) does not throw ParseException if the input cannot be matched.
If the parse succeeds, the ParsePosition is updated to the index of the next character after the last one used, and the error index is left as -1.
If the parse fails, at present the ParsePosition is not updated at all, unlike SimpleDateFormat which is able to set the error Index to the location where the error occurr.
It does not appear to be possible to determine the error location because the matching against the format string is all or nothing.
This means that a successful parse can only be detected by checking whether the ParsePosition has been updated.
This needs to be documented, and some unit tests added.
