If ExceptionUtils.getCause is provided a throwable whose cause method cannot be interrogated by reflection due to an IllegalAccessError, the cause is not presented to the client.
In principle this is to be expected from this legacy method.  However, indexOfThrowable and indexOfType rely on getCause, and are not marked as deprecated.
Now that Throwable.getCause has been in the language for quite some time, I'd like to propose that, until ExceptionUtils.getCause is actually removed, that its behavior be modified to first attempt to get the exception cause using normal invocation, falling back to reflection if no cause is found.
I'll be pushing a GitHub PR to this effect.
