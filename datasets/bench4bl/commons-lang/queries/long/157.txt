In Eclipse 2.1.M4, you get the following warning compiling 
java/org/apache/commons/lang/ObjectUtils.java:
Access to enclosing constructor ObjectUtils.Null() is emulated by a synthetic 
accessor method. Increasing its visibility will improve your performance
	ObjectUtils.java	Jakarta Commons 
Lang/src/java/org/apache/commons/lang	line 85
Attaching patch.
FYI, there are currently no other such warnings in the "src/java" tree. There 
are plenty of warnings in the "src/test" tree, which I am not as much 
concerned with.
