ClassUtils.getClass(ClassUtils.class.getClassLoader(), "void") throws "ClassNotFoundException: [V".
Root cause: ClassUtils contains an abbreviationMap for use in dealing with abbreviated primitive types like "[I" and "[J". However, this commit introduces a "void -> V" mapping for "completeness".
This seems wholly erroneous, since the maps are used only for primitive array abbreviations, and "void/V" is not among them.
