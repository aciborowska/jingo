This bug report is based on a post to commons-dev from Eric Pugh.
I am attaching a patch that includes the test case that Eric posted and two
others that confirm that the current code will accept strings with trailing
characters that are not type qualifiers.
The patch also adds a check to NumberUtils.isNumber() that causes these strings
to be rejected. Assuming that my understanding of the code is correct, this
patch should fix the problem without changing behavior on other strings. All
other tests succeed with the patch applied.
