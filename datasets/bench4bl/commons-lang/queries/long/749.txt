The Bundle-SymbolicName in the manifest is:
Bundle-SymbolicName: org.apache.commons.lang
It should be:
Bundle-SymbolicName: org.apache.commons.lang3
When you install the new lang3 library in an OSGi container such as Apache Felix beside the old v2.x library, they conflict with each other because the SymbolicName is used as a unique id and they conflict with each other.  My only work around at the moment is to manually edit the manifest and repackage.
TLDR version:  The SymbolicName in the manifest does not reflect the lang3 package structure and conflicts in OSGi containers which are already using previous versions of Commons Lang.
