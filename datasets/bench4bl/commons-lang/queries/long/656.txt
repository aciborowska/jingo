I recognized the following example in class StringUtils:


      StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut("zzabyycdxx", '') = 0



According to Niall Pembertons answer on the user mailing list (Oct, 27th 2010) I should report an issue on this.
He suggested the following replacement:

      StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut("zzabyycdxx", "")   = -1
