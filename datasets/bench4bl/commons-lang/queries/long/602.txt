The purpose of ContextedRuntimeException was to provide an 'unchecked' exception with contexted features.  the fact that it now extends 'java.langException' makes it a checked exception identical to ContextedException and doesn't fulfill its purpose.
Recommend you either just remove ContextedRuntimeException (as it's now redundant with ContextedException) or revert the change that has it extending java.lang.Exception back so that it extends java.lang.RuntimeException.  I would prefer keeping ContextedRuntimeException and having it extend RuntimeException.
I apologize for not catching this earlier.  I only caught it now in attempt to use ContextedRuntimeException on one of my projects and discovering that it is no longer unchecked.
Thanks for looking at this.
