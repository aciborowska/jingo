The implementation of Commons Lang StringUtils#getLevenshteinDistance(String,
String) is based on work from <http://www.merriampark.com/ld.htm>. While this
implementation works, it is very memory hungry and can thus slow down heavy
computations (GC has much more to collect in memory-constrained environment).
Actual implementation needs x*y byte of memory.
An improved implementation can be found at
<http://www.merriampark.com/ldjava.htm>, which can lead to performance
improvements of up to 3 times (my own internal benchmarks in low-memory
situation). This new implementation needs x+y bytes of memory.
Please change the getLevenshteinDistance() implementation to use the one at
<http://www.merriampark.com/ldjava.htm>.
