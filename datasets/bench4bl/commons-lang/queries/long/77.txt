I think it should be important for calls to ToStringStyle.appendFieldStart() be
balanced with calls to ToStringStyle.appendFieldEnd().  The method
ReflectioinToStringBuilder.appendFieldsIn() has an appendFieldStart call, but
not an appendFieldEnd call.
This is very important in my situation because I am coding an XMLToStringBuilder
and the field does not get closed. 
I will attach a patch.
