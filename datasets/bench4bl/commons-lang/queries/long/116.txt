I have a class with an Enum inner class, and I call MyClass.MyEnum.getEnumList()
in a JSP page (with Tomcat 3.3.1).  I'm using enums pretty much exactly as
described in Enum's javadoc.  It returns an empty Collection, even though I have
defined several enums.  At any point in the JSP page after I reference a
specific Enum, the list shows up properly populated.
What's happening is presumably a classloader issue, where
MyClass.MyEnum.getEnumList() can be called without loading this class.  Perhaps
Tomcat's multiple classloaders make this possible.  In any case, the workaround
is easy.  I changed:
        public static List getEnumList() 
{
            return getEnumList(MyEnum.class);
        }

to:
        public static List getEnumList() 
{
            new MyParentClass();
            return getEnumList(MyEnum.class);
        }

for all the methods that need to access the enums.
