Per Henri's email to commons-dev on 5/23/2004, StopWatch currently let's you 
call split() or stop() multiple times.  StopWatch could benefit from some 
validation, to make sure the following validation occurs:
1. split(), suspend(), or stop() cannot be invoked twice.
2. unsplit() may only be called if the watch has been split()
3. resume() may only be called if the watch has been suspend()
4. start() cannot be called twice.
Whomever takes on this burden should take some time to draw a simple state 
transition diagram and put it in the JavaDoc.
