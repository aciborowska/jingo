Classes that are located in org.apache.commons.lang.enum package can't be used 
with 1.5 jdk (aka the 5.0) because the "enum" is a reserved keyword. Compiler 
error looks like this: "as of release 1.5, 'enum' is a keyword, and may not be 
used as an identifier (try -source 1.4 or lower to use 'enum' as an 
identifier)"
There probably should be a separate jar for 1.5+ jdk
