In case of Java and ECMA Script, the style of unicode escape '\uxxxxxx' cannot be accepted. We need to separate it into high-surrogate and low-surrogate.
For example, you put the surrogate pair



'\uDBFF\uDFFD'



output must be



"\\uDBFF\\uDFFD"



However you get



"\\u10FFFD"



Test case here:



@Test

public void testEscapeSurrogatePairs() throws Exception {

    assertEquals("\\uDBFF\\uDFFD", StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava("\uDBFF\uDFFD"));

    assertEquals("\\uDBFF\\uDFFD", StringEscapeUtils.escapeEcmaScript("\uDBFF\uDFFD"));

}



I attached the patch which implements simple solution.
But UnicodeEscaper.java should not be specified for Java, I think. We need to discuss about it.
This issue does not be appeared in unescape method.
