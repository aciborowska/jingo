It's generally a bad idea to catch Throwable.
The getFormattedExceptionMessage method should be changed to catch less; e.g. Exception + RuntimeException should be adequate.
The Javadoc examples in ContextedException and ContextedRuntimeException suggest catching Throwable; these examples should be changed too.
