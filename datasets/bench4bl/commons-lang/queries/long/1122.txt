Following the discussion at https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/pull/47 we need to decide how malformed inputs should be handled by the swap method. We have to handle several forms of malformed inputs and we should decide how to do that based on the current behavior of ArrayUtils. Malformed inputs are:

array == null
array.length == 0
offset1 < 0
offset2 < 0
len < 0
offset1 > offset2
offset1 > array.length
offset2 > array.length
offset1 + len > array.length
offset2 + len > array.length
