Begin Quote ***
To use this class write code as follows: 





 public class Person {
   String name;
   int age;
   boolean isSmoker;
   ...
   public String toString() 
{
     return new ToStringBuilder(this).
       append(name, "name").     //!! should be - append("name", name).
       append(age, "age").       //!! should be - append("age", age).
       append(smoker, "smoker"). //!! should be - append("smoker", smoker).
       toString();
   }
 }





End Quote ***





In short, the order of arguments to the append method in the example have been 
reversed.
Thank you.
