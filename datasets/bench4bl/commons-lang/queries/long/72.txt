I get a NullPointerException when calling EqualsBuilder.append(Object[], Object
[]).  I narrowed the code down to this section:
        for (int i = 0; i < lhs.length && isEquals; ++i) {
            Class lhsClass = lhs[i].getClass();
            if (!lhsClass.isInstance(rhs[i])) 
{
                isEquals = false; //If the types don't match, not equal
                break;
            }
            append(lhs[i], rhs[i]);
        }
I don't think a lot of this code is necessary.  I think it will work like this:
        for (int i = 0; i < lhs.length && isEquals; ++i) 
{
            append(lhs[i], rhs[i]);
        }

because append(Object, Object) deals with Class issues.
