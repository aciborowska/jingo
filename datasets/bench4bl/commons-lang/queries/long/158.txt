In other languages, the string split method can split a string using a whole
string as the delimiter rather than using the separator string as a list of
characters at which to split the string-to-be-split.  I've implemented these
methods a few times, and I've given them the signature split( String, String,
boolean[, int] ) so that they can delegate to the existing lang split( String,
String[, int] ) methods where appropriate.
