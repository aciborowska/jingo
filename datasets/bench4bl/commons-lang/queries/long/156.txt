I meet this error while trying to compile cocoon code using JDK1.5.0:
 /cocoon-2.1/src/blocks/forms/java/org/apache/cocoon/forms/event/ProcessingPhase.java:22:
as of release 1.5, 'enum' is a keyword, and may not be used as an identifier
(try -source 1.4 or lower to use 'enum' as an identifier)
import org.apache.commons.lang.enum.ValuedEnum;
Seems like JDK1.5.0 don't like the enum keyword inside the import statement.
