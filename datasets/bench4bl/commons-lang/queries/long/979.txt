The TypeUtils.parameterizeWithOwner method uses the following format string:
"invalid number of type parameters specified: expected %s, got %s"
with parameters that are actually ints.
This means that the parameters are boxed into Integers and then converted to Strings by the formatter.
Seems to me it would make more sense to either create the Strings directly from the ints, or box the ints and use "%d" for the place holders.
