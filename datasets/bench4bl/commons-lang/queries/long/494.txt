AFAICT, CharSet sub-classes cannot be made thread-safe.
This is because the HashMap and HashSet collections are not thread-safe.
If a sub-class updates COMMON, there is no guarantee that getInstance() will see the update.
In the case of the instance variable "set", the sub-class could override all the read/write methods to provide thread-safety.
