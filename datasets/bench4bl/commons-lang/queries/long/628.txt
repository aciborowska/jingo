The Javadoc description for HashCodeBuilder.append(boolean) says that it "adds iConstant * 1 to the hashCode," however, the code is actually:
iTotal = iTotal * iConstant + (value ? 0 : 1). It is probably just a typo, but it easy to correct.
And the reference to hashCode handling in java.lang.Boolean:  "not a 1231 or 1237 as done in java.lang.Boolean" could be clarified with more detail. Otherwise, it requires going to the java.lang Javadoc and finding the java.lang.Boolean.hashCode Javadoc description.
