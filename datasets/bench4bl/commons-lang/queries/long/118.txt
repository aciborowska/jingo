Pass a string into the unescapeHtml() method that contains a hex entity (i.e. 
· instead of ·) and you will get a NumberFormatException.  The 
offending code is in Entity.java, line 690.  It should check whether the 
character after the # is 'x' and if so, prefix it with '0' and call 
Integer.decode().intValue() (or some other hex converting function).
Hex entities are valid HTML 
(http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/latin1.html) so this should 
be supported.
