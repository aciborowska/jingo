In EnumUtils all BitVector related methods fail in handling Enums with more than 32 values.
This is due to a implicit int -> long conversion in generating the Enum value long mask.
Bad code : here 1 is an int value so the << operation is done into an int context and then, the result is converted to a long value



long mask = 1 << 32;    // -> mask = 1 and not 4294967296 (0x100000000)



Good code : here 1L is a long value so the << operation is done into an long context



long mask = 1L << 32;    // -> mask = 4294967296 (0x100000000)
