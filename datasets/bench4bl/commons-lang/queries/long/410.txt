The recently added replaceEach* methods use "repl" for the original string list, and "with" for the new (replacement) string list.
These names are rather confusing.
RE engines tend to use words such as:
Perl:
searchlist
replacementlist
ORO:
pattern
replacement
Java has String.replace(regex, replacement)
In all cases, "replacement" is used for the NEW string, not the original string which is to be replaced.
Seems to me that searchString/List and replacement[List] would be unambiguous as well as descriptive.
Also useful in IDEs which show possible method completions.
Changing the names of the parameters would not affect the API.
