The Javadoc example for the class EqualsBuilder ist questionable:
 public boolean equals(Object obj) {
   if (obj instanceof MyClass == false) 
{
     return false;
   }
  ...
The implementation with instanceof lacks guarantees like equals-symmetry  (see e.g. http://www.agiledeveloper.com/articles/equals062002.htm  for a discussion of the issue)
The example should be changed to use getClass(). Attention: the solution in the link above is incomplete as it doesn't check for null
