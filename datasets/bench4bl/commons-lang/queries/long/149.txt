The indexOfThrowable() method should use Class.isAssignableFrom() to find the
nested esception so that it can find subclasses of the given exception.
Or alternatively, the javadoc should state the usage of Class.equals()
explicitly so that people that go looking for SQLExceptions know that the method
is useless to them and that they'll need to write their own.
