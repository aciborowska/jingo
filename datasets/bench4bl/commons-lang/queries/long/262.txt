When an enum is created it is placed in the static hashmap - cEnumClasses.  If the enum is created from a classloader which has a limited lifetime then due to the strong reference the classloader is never garbage collected resulting in a memory leak.  
I believe that making the cEnumClasses a WeakHashMap should resolve the problem.
