The attached patch modifies the behavior of StringUtils.sliceFirst and
StringUtils.sliceFirstRemainder to consistently handle <string, delimiter> pairs
where the delimiter is null, empty or does not occur in the string, as discussed
on the list.
The patch also refactors the slice functions to take advantage of
StringUtils.indexOf and StringUtils.lastIndexOf.
