In the examples given along with the descriptions of startsWith, startsWithIgnoreCase, endsWith and endsWithIgnoreCase of StringUtils class, the full string and the suffix/prefix are used in the wrong order.
eg: 
It is mentioned that StringUtils.startsWith("abc", "abcdef") = true
It should be StringUtils.startsWith("abcdef", "abc") = true
