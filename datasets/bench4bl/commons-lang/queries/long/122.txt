The official HTML character entity spec does not include the popular "&apos;"
entity name for the single quote character '. the StringUtils class correctly
follows this behavior, leaving single quotes alone. However, many developers
incorrectly assume that ' will get escaped into &apos; (I was one!) and we can

Note: Not all common HTML entity names are formally included in the standard
specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/entities.html, as listed
below). This method follows the standard, and thus does not escape the
single-quote ' character into &apos.
