startsWithAny says in its javaDoc: 



/** 

@return {@code true} if the CharSequence starts with any of the the prefixes, case insensitive, or both {@code null} 

**/



but uses startsWith(final CharSequence str, final CharSequence prefix) which is case sensitive.
Either the JavaDoc of startsWithAny method should be changed or startsWithIgnoreCase() or startsWith(CharSequence,CharSequence,boolean) should be used.
