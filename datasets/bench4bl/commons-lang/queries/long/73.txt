The only mechanism in place to capture a superclass's toString() values in a 
sublcass is to use .append(super.toString()).  This of course does prefixes and 
suffixes the value with the package and class name.  In order to address this, 
perhaps a new .appendSuper(super.toString()) method is introduced that trims 
off the prefix and suffix of the super.toString() prior to appending.  A new 
constructor that automatically does this trimming could be added too.
