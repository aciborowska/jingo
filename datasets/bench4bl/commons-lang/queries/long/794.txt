On Windows Server 2008 R2 (a Rackspace Cloud Instance), the values of SystemUtils.IS_OS_WINDOWS_2008 and SystemUtils.IS_OS_WINDOWS_VISTA are incorrect: the former is false and the latter is true.
I'm not sure how to fix the VISTA flag (as I don't have an instance to test against), but the cause of WINDOWS_2008 being set to false is that the match explicitly requires the version to be 6.1, where 6.0 can apparently also be the version number for 2008 R2.
