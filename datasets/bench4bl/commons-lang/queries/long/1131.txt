The following test will fail because the equals(StrBuilder) overload in StrBuilder does not check for null inputs:



    @Test

    public void testEqualsWithNullStrBuilder() throws Exception {

        final StrBuilder sb = new StrBuilder();

        final StrBuilder other = null;

        assertFalse(sb.equals(other));

    }
