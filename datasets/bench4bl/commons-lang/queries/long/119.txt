I want to create my own version of EqualsBuilder that not only goes through
arrays and checks if array contents are equal, but also goes through Maps,
Lists, Sets, etc.  I can't because isEquals is private and there is no setEquals
method.  Please make isEquals protected or add a setEquals method.  Thanks!
