Somehow setSeed is getting called during construction, causing an
UnsupportedOperationException.
Attached patch fixes this as well as errors in nextInt() and nextLong() which
cause them to always return 0 values.
I am also attaching unit tests that show these errors and also cover the other
methods in the RandomUtils class.
