The attached patch fixes some javadoc typos and adds some more examples and test
cases for StringUtils.
It does include one code change â€“ isNotBlank is changed to return !isBlank
instead of including the negated search logic. Apologies if the intention is not
for isNotBlank <-> !isBlank.  The examples, tests and docs suggest that this
should be true now.  Of course, it is possible that I am missing something.
I also introduced (with no explanation) the * notation discussed on the list to
make the examples more expressive.  I will submit a replacement patch if we
don't want to use this.
