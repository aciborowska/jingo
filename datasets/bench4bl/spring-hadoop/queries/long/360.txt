Quick test to update from 13 to 14 resulted error:






java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.avro.Schema.getJsonProp(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/codehaus/jackson/JsonNode;

If checking what we have in deps, both avro-1.7.6.jar and hive-exec-0.12.0.jar has a org.apache.avro.Schema class. One in hive is a really old version and it doesn't even have org.apache.avro.JsonProperties in it. I believe classpath with gradle got a different order and broke because of that. Same problem with kite 13 but I think we just got lucky with a classpath and class loading.
