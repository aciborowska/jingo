This block of code in HiveScriptRunner (line 98) swallows exceptions.
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            try 
{
                hive.clean();
            }
 catch (Exception exc) {            
            }
        } finally 
{
            IOUtils.closeStream(reader);
        }
When I have a spring-batch workflow running a Hive job as one of the intermediate steps, I'd like the Hive Tasklet to fail out if something goes wrong, and bubble up an exception so that I can get some meaningful error messages in my logs (and prevent dependent steps from even executing)
