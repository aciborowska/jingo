What we have:






@Configuration




public class ObjectPostProcessorConfiguration {




    @Bean




    public ObjectPostProcessor<Object> objectPostProcessor(AutowireCapableBeanFactory beanFactory) {




        return new AutowireBeanFactoryObjectPostProcessor(beanFactory);




    }




}






This doesn't work with Spring Security because it is using same name. This happened because some of these config classes were ported from sec. Master is already fixed per SHDP-451 and changes needs to be ported back.
