spring-yarn-integration is using spring-integration tcp channels and by following same testing logic used in spring-integration it seems that we hit into problems with trying to find free ports.
Happens randomly and difficult to re-produce
i.e. MindIntegrationRawTests:
<bean id="tcpIpUtils" class="org.springframework.integration.test.util.SocketUtils" />
<bean id="socketSupport" class="org.springframework.yarn.integration.support.DefaultPortExposingTcpSocketSupport" />
<ip:tcp-connection-factory id="serverConnectionFactory"
  type="server"
  port="#
{tcpIpUtils.findAvailableServerSocket(7400)}
"
  socket-support="socketSupport"
  serializer="serializer"
  deserializer="deserializer"/>
<bean id="mindAppmasterService" class="org.springframework.yarn.integration.ip.mind.TestService" >
  <property name="socketSupport" ref="socketSupport"/>
  <property name="messageChannel" ref="serverChannel"/>
</bean>
Test fails with:
assertThat(mindAppmasterService.getPort(), greaterThan(0));
