The DistCp.copy() that has booleans is incomplete.
It builds an arglist but only adds the arguments from the "preserveReplication"
argument to the "delete" argument and doesn't include:
Long fileLimit, Long sizeLimit, String fileList, String... uris
The use of this method results in:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Missing dst path
Two other versions of DistCp.copy() are affected by this also, since both
call the one with the bug in it: They are the the ones having EnumSet<Preserve>
as the first argument.
Workaround: use the DistCp.copy(String... args) versions
