DistributedCacheFactoryBean in afterPropertiesSet creates and closes filsystem instance. because in hadoop 2 filesystem instance are singletons, further talking to hdfs is not possible.
fix is simple: in DistributedCacheFactoryBean change line 117 to
	HdfsResourceLoader loader = new HdfsResourceLoader(fs);
its regression from RC1, please fix it asap.
