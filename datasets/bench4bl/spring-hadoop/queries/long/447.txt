In `PartitionTextFileWriter.createWriter(Configuration, Path, CodecInfo)` we create anonymous TextFileWriter to override its `close()` method order to clear writers away from AbstractPartitionDataStoreWriter. However we don't shutdown `TextFileWriter` and thus its idle timeout task is kept running which later is causing trouble to clear correct writers away from partition writer.
