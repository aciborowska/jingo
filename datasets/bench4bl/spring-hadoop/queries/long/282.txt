ResourceLocalizer interface has really become ambiguous over time when more functionality has been added. Original idea of that interface was to get entries for local resources for containers.
Now that we have functionality to copy resources into hdfs during a localization process, use staging concept, etc, it is time to split this interface into parent and child.
ResourceLocalizer should only have methods for local resources, and possibly SmartResourceLocalizer could then have rest of the functionality.
