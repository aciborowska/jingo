We already have distZip task to package stuff and this collides with application plugin imported by boot gradle plugin. Application plugin creates a distZip task which calls startScripts task which then fails because we don't define mainClassName.
Just need to disable startScripts and distZip tasks for spring-yarn-boot-build-tests.
