We get trouble with hostname resolving with error:






Call From neo/127.0.1.1 to neo:40891 failed on connection exception






Resource manager components resolves hostname neo to my loopback 127.0.1.1, but under the hood:






org.apache.hadoop.security.SecurityUtil.getByName(String)






Resolves hostname to my public wifi ip.
Hostname resolving inside SecurityUtil is either StandardHostResolver(default) or QualifiedHostResolver. This is controlled by hadoop.security.token.service.use_ip which is true by default.
hadoop 2.3.x added file hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-tests/src/test/resources/core-site.xml to jar file container MiniYARNCluster class which we rely on. SecurityUtil is using a static initializer block to read hadoop configuration which gets this value from any core-site.xml found from a classpath. hadoop.security.token.service.use_ip is set to false in that file, effectively changing behaviour and hostname is resolved differently 2.2.x vs. 2.3.x.
