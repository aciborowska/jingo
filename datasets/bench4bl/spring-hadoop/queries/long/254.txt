We really can't use AbstractYarnClusterTests to test yarn apps which are packaged to be used by boot. Reason for this is that AbstractYarnClusterTests expects YarnClient to be available in a spring test context, which it is not if executing client as boot app.
Most elegant solution for is probably a new base class which understands a minicluster and boot based client app.
