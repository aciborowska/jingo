If a container is allocated and later rejected by all clusters and projections, none of a clusters will end up in a configure state which should fire up new allocations. We should force allocation for all clusters when we receive completed container from yarn but it didn't belong to any cluster. This is an indication that clusters may not be in a satisfied state.
