[This problem affects all NT-based Windows variants, including Win2k and XP] The Windows NT kernel has a well-known problem: When you minimize an application, Windows will trim the working set of the process. This is described in the following Microsoft knowledgebase entry, which also provides a solution: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;293215 Certain applications seem particularly affected by this problem -- Java GUI applications and the Mozilla suite seem particularly sensitive. (Mozilla-based apps include a hidden configuration option to enable the solution mentioned above.) When you bring back the minimized application, the OS will start swapping the pages back into physical memory, "trashing" the disk and meanwhile making the application completely unresponsive. Waits up to a minute have been observed with large (300-350MB) working sets. The aforementioned solution prevents the OS from immediately swapping out the application, but will still swap out the application to give priority to other focused applications, so the fix has no significant negative effects on a running system. A patch was offered on the SWT dev mailing list some time ago, but it does not seem to have been recorded or accepted: http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/platform-swt-dev/msg03710.html Further references: http://www.javagaming.org/cgi-bin/JGNetForums/YaBB.cgi?board=Tuning;action=display;num=1090286158 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=76831 http://www.eclipsepowered.org/archives/2004/11/18/best-jvm-settings-for-eclipse/
