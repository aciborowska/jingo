3.1 RC1, Windows XP - open the tasks view - click on the "Resource" Column and release to sort the table. Note that the column header is inset while pressing down and then restores to normal look on release. - now press down on the "Location" column but drag the mouse off the view before releasing the mouse button. Problem: The "Location" column keeps its "depressed" look until another column is clicked. This can mislead one into thinking the table is sorted by the wrong column. Not sure if this is SWT or JFace...
