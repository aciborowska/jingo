When fetching album data for a page (or even a user that doesn't keep their albums private), it isn't necessary to make the request with an access token. For example:
https://graph.facebook.com/cocacola/albums
Will return JSON data for all of Coca-Cola's albums, even without an access token.
Therefore, getAlbums(ownerId) should not require authorization and should be callable from a non-authorized Facebook template.
