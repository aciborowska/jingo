When a SWF file is posted to Facebook, the Post type will be "swf" rather than "photo" or "video". This is an unrecognized Post type, causing the deserialization of the feed to fail.
Two things could fix this: First, handle the "swf" type. Second, have some fallback strategy for deserializing POSTs when the type is unrecognized.
See https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-facebook/issues/1 for the original discussion of this issue.
