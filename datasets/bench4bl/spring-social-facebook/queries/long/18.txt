Sometimes Facebook returns a "false" when requesting an object. This seems to indicate that the access token does not have sufficient permission to view the requested object (although this should be confirmed). When this happens, a ClassCastException occurs during the binding.
The exception thrown is indicative of an internal binding error and should not escape the API boundaries. It should be caught and handled (probably rethrown as some sort of ApiException).
