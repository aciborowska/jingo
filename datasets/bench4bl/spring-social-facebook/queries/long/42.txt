as you know, org.springframework.social.facebook.api.impl.FacebookErrorHandler doesn't handle there 404 Not found error.
they (404 not found error) still handle by handleUncategorizedError (DefaultResponseErrorHandler.handleError detect and make HttpClientErrorException, and FacebookErrorHandler caught all of exception & translate to UncategorizedApiException)
it's harmful if you using spring-social-facebook on your project.
(that' why i catch UncategorizedApiException and check that's rootCause is instanceof HttpClientErrorException, and another check HttpStatus is equal to HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND (404), then finally i can do what i want.)
and there org.springframework.social.SocialException hierarchy still there. (and i want 404 Not Found Error translate to org.springframework.social.ResourceNotFoundException. no more Uncategorized Exception)
