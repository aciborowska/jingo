The documentation found at:
http://static.springsource.org/spring-social-facebook/docs/1.1.x/reference/html/apis.html
states that I should be able to retrieve the profile url this way:






String profileUrl = facebook.userOperations().getProfileUrl();






Indeed that would be useful (for my use case), but the UserOperations interface is missing the getProfileUrl() method, thus either the documentation is wrong or the method must be implemented.
I would prefer to have the method instead of fixing the documentation
