See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-social-facebook/issues/150
FacebookAdapter sets the profile URL to https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/
{userId}
. This URL does however not work for non-app-scoped IDs, i.e. users that first authenticated with API versions earlier than 2.0.
The fix is to user profile.getLink() in ProfileAdapter.
