AbstractRegionParser puts a parent attribute into the bean definition that points to the parent definition. This is causing hashCode to run into an endless loop and therefore breaking the API.
Spring IDE is collecting those items in maps and is therefore using the hashCode method on those objects (see https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/STS-3450).
