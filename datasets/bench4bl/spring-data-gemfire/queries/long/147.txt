The gateway receiver was not being started automatically, so gateways don't work "out-of-the-box". If started explicitly then things start working.
As a workaround it can be started it directly from the cache-context.xml like this:
<gfe:gateway-receiver id="gateway-receiver" cache-ref="gemfireCache" start-port="10340" end-port="10349" />
<!-- For some reason Spring Data doesn't start the GatewayReceiver itself -->
  <bean id="gatewayReceiverStarter" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.MethodInvokingFactoryBean">
    <property name="targetObject"><ref local="gateway-receiver" /></property>
    <property name="targetMethod" value="start" />
  </bean>
