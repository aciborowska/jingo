So farm, the initialization of GemfireMappingContext instance has been a repository factory local matter which under certain circumstances could lead to Spring Data REST not being able to pick up entity meta information correctly.
There have been various steps taken to fix this but the slightly overcomplicate the matter and even introduces some invalid registrations of Spring beans in lifecycle phases that must not trigger registrations anymore. We should rather move to a single GemfireMappingContext bean definition by default and make sure the downstream components consume that one.
