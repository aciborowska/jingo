Attached is a maven project which highlights the problem.
Essentially the user is attempting to use JSONFormatter which uses PDX under the covers. The sample works, once one adds pdx-persistent=true to the cache definition.
Documentation states that pdx-persistent defaults to true: http://docs.spring.io/spring-gemfire/docs/1.2.0.M1/reference/appendix-schema.html
