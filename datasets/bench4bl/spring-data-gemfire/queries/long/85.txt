When trying to create a Spring GemFire cache with pdx, setting the attribute pdx-disk-store throws an error due to there not being setters or getters for pdxDiskStore.... I see in the code there is pdxDiskStoreName....
We need to be able to handle the referencing of diskstores create from the cache.xml.
