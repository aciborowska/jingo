Currently, the Spring Data GemFire XML schema (XSD) requires the threshold attribute on the <gfe:eviction> element in SDG XML namespace configuration meta-data.  The <gfe:eviction> is used to set Evictions settings on a Region such as (maximums, action and algorithm/type) where the threshold corresponds to the maximum value for ENTRY_COUNT and MEMORY_SIZE.  However, the threshold has no meaning for the HEAP_PERCENTAGE Eviction type/algorithm and therefore should not be required.
The "threshold", or rather percentage when Regions employ the HEAP_LRU algorithm for Eviction comes from the Resource Manager's configuration applied at the Cache-level, and in SDG, that means the <gfe:cache> element's  values for critical-heap-percentage and eviction-heap-percentage.
