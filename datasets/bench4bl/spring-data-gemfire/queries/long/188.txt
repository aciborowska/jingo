In Section 5.1, regarding changing the default namespace to that of GemFire I believe there are some typos in the example provided.
As beans is no longer the default namespace you need to qualify the <beans> element (and closing tag) with <beans:beans>.  This at a minimum breaks the eclipse/spring code completion.  
I believe the beans namespace, at note (2) should be "xmlns:beans="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans".  The number 2 may simply be covering up part of the text over the xmlns:.
Also there is a typo defining a bean at note (3).  It says <beabean id ... > but should be <beans:beans id ...>
