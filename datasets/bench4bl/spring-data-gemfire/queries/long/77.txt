Not sure if its a bug or intended behavior, but testing in OSGI shows this:






An Import-Package could not be resolved. 




  Caused by missing constraint in bundle <org.springframework.data.gemfire_0.0.0> constraint: <Import-Package: org.springframework.asm; version="[3.1.0,4.0.0)">






Which is OK if that's a erequirement, but wasn't sure if its intentional or it could set its minimal dependency to 3.0.6
