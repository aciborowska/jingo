After importing current master branch into STS/Eclipse I am getting several problems (one problem was already reported, i.e. missing dependency on to gemfire 7 beta).
The other problems are compilation errors like this:
The method accept(File, String) of type new FilenameFilter(){} must override a superclass method	AbstractRegionFactoryBeanTest.java	/spring-data-gemfire/src/test/java/org/springframework/data/gemfire/support	line 63	Java Problem
Looks to me like it rather needs Java 1.6 compliance?
