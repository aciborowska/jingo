See, for example, definition for cache-server:






<xsd:attribute name="notify-by-subscription" type="xsd:boolean" use="optional" default="true" />






I suggest to reaplce all xsd:boolean to xsd:string. There is a workaround - disable schema validation in Spring though it's better to correct schema since XML schema validation is generally useful.
