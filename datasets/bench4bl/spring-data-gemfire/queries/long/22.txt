When you set the keyConstraint on a region, like this:






<bean class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.RegionFactoryBean" name="data">




  ...




  <property name="attributes">




	  <bean class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.RegionAttributesFactory">




		  <property name="keyConstraint" value="java.lang.Integer" />




			...




    </bean>




  </property>




</bean>






and try to autowire that region BY TYPE into a test, like so:






@Autowired




Region region;






Then you get the exception (from DefaultListableBeanFactory, line 761 in Spring 3.0.4)






Key type [class java.lang.Integer] of map [com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.Region] must be assignable to [java.lang.String]






This is because the bean factory thinks that the Region is a Map (well, it is) but for some reason needs the key type to be assignable from string. This error message is really confusing, so maybe we should do something about it?
