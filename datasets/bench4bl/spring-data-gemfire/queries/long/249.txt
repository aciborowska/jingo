Current the Spring Data GemFire XML Schema (XSD) restricts the value of the compaction-threshold attribute on the <gfe:disk-store/> element as type 'short', with valid values between 0 and 100, rather than using a type of 'string' thereby allowing the use of property placeholder values.
The XSD should be changed so that the GemFire Disk Store, compaction-threshold attribute is of type 'xsd:string', allowing the use of property placeholder values.
