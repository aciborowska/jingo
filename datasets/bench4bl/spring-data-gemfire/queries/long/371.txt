Due to changes in GemFire 8.1, even though Spring Data GemFire's <gfe:gateway-receiver/> XML namespace (XSD) element for configuring and creating GemFire GatewayReceiver components as a bean in the Spring container supports "manual starts" using the manual-start attribute, the SDG GatewayReceiverFactoryBean now needs to properly set GemFire's GatewayReceiverFactory.setManualStart(:boolean), otherwise the GatewayReceiver will start on initialization even when manual-start is explicitly set to true as determined by GatewayReceiver.isRunning().
