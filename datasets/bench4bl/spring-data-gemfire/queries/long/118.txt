If follow the instructions to build SpringGemfire from its readme.md I am getting the following error:
> Could not resolve group:com.gemstone.gemfire, module:gemfire, version:7.0.Beta-SNAPSHOT.
  Required by:
      org.springframework.data:spring-data-gemfire:1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
   > Could not GET 'https://repo.springsource.org/ext-private-local/com/gemstone/gemfire/gemfire/7.0.Beta-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml'. Received status code 401 from server: Unauthorized
What do I need to do to satisfy the missing dependency? The build instructions should probably explain this.
