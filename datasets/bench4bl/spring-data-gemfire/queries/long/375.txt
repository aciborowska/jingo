The Spring Data GemFire XML namespace (XSD) <gfe:gateway-hub> element is missing the 'max-time-between-pings' attribute corresponding to GemFire's GatewayHub.setMaximumTimeBetweenPings(:int) property.
This property and configuration attribute has been present since 4.2.3.
Note, however, the corresponding Spring Data GemFire GatewayHubFactoryBean class currently allows the GemFire GatewayHub 'maximumTimeBetweenPings' property to be set using the 'setMaximumTimeBetweenPings(:int)' FactoryBean method.
