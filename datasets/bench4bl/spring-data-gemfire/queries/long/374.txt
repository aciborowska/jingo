Currently, SDG's GatewayHubFactoryBean class is forcing the GemFire Gateway Queue to be 'persistent' if a DiskStore was explicitly referenced (named).
However, this behavior fails to take into account the fact that a GemFire Gateway Queue can overflow it's contents to disk in order to reduce memory pressure.
