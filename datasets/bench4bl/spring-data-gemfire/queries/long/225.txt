When defining replicated regions that are subregions, the same data-policy heuristics that are used for top-level replicated regions should be applied. Eg.
<gfe:replicated-region id="FOO">
   <gfe:replicated-region
	name="BAR"
        scope="distributed-ack" />
For the FOO region, the heuristics in ReplicatedRegionFactoryBean#resolveDataPolicy will figure out a data-policy. But, for the /FOO/BAR subregion, the raw SubRegionFactoryBean is used, which does not have the same logic in it.
