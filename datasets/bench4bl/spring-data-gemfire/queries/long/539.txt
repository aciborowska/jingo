Currently, the GemfireCache.evict(key:Object) method calls Pivotal GemFire's (Apache Geode's) Region.destroy(key:Object) method, which can throw a EntryNotFoundException causing an application @Sevice component operation annotated with the @CacheEvict annotation to fail.
See StackOverflow post (question... "Gemfire EntryNotFoundException for @CacheEvict") for more details.
