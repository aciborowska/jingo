methodmetadata -> functionid
OnRegionMethodMetadata -> Filter and GemfireFunctionUtils
GemfireFunctionUtils -> PojoFunctionWrapper
Moving annotations into their own package and GemfireFunctionUtils to the top level function package resolve the cycle. 
Putting the end-user annotations into the annotation package also makes it easier to understand the annotation based programming model as other internal classes don't add any noise.
