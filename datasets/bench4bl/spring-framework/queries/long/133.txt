So granted WebLogic 6.1 is a bit behind the times, but it shipped with a version of the javax.servlet.Filter interface 'between' J2EE 1.2 & J2EE 1.3.  As such, the Filter interface is:
package javax.servlet;
import java.io.IOException;
public interface Filter
{
    public abstract void doFilter(ServletRequest servletrequest, ServletResponse servletresponse, FilterChain filterchain)
        throws IOException, ServletException;
    public abstract FilterConfig getFilterConfig();
    public abstract void setFilterConfig(FilterConfig filterconfig);
}
OpenSessionInViewFilter nicely implements the 1.3 / 1.4 spec'd interface, which doesn't require getFilterConfig or setFilterConfig. 
Would it be possible to add an OpenSessionInView implementation that does implement these methods?  I've added this to my spring source, but figure other people may start running into the same problem.
