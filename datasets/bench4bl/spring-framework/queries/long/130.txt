When Spring is bootstrapped and it attempts to get the SQL error codes from a Sybase ASE 12.5.1 database server, it fails. I know this because the following is written in the log:
[14:05:2004:32]  INFO [main] org.springframework.jdbc.support.SQLErrorCodesFactory:159 - Looking up default SQLErrorCodes for DataSource
[14:05:2004:32]  INFO [main] org.springframework.jdbc.support.SQLErrorCodesFactory:181 - Database Product Name is Sybase SQL Server
[14:05:2004:32]  INFO [main] org.springframework.jdbc.support.SQLErrorCodesFactory:182 - Driver Version is jConnect (TM) for JDBC(TM)/5.2(Build 10250)/P/JDK12/Thu Oct  7 12:24:31 1999
[14:05:2004:32]  INFO [main] org.springframework.jdbc.support.SQLErrorCodesFactory:187 - Error Codes for Sybase SQL Server not found
So, I've created my own sql-error-codes.xml in the root of the classpath and I've debugged into the Spring source. I know that the root of the problem is that Sybase is sending back "Sybase SQL Server" as the name of the database product name. The bean in sql-error-codes.xml is called "Sybase" and I can't rename it to "Sybase SQL Server" without the getting a SAXException.
To fix the problem, I added a special case to the source much like the one for DB2. If the string starts with "Sybase", I assign the dbName "Sybase".
