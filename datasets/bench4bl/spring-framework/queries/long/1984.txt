I have been extending SimpleMappingExceptionResolver and had it throwing an unexpected null pointer in the inherited findMatchingViewName(). I was passing my own mapping object into the method yet it was never using it as it is the inherited instance Properties object that gets used in the method as there is a 'this' in front of all the references. I would expect the local one to be used.
protected String findMatchingViewName(Properties exceptionMappings, Exception ex) {
		int deepest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
		for (Enumeration names = this.exceptionMappings.propertyNames(); names.hasMoreElements() {
			String exceptionMapping = (String) names.nextElement();
			int depth = getDepth(exceptionMapping, ex);
			if (depth >= 0 && depth < deepest) 
{
				deepest = depth;
				return this.exceptionMappings.getProperty(exceptionMapping);
			}
		}
		return null;
	}
