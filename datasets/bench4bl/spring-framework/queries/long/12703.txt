The following two calls do not yield consistent results when the method is a method of a dynamic proxy.






AnnotatedElementUtils.getAnnotationAttributes(this.method, FooBar.class.getName());






The above returns null; whereas, the following call on the same method returns the FooBar annotation instance.






AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation(this.method, FooBar.class)






The code merged for SPR-12080 has some TODOs in ApplicationListenerMethodAdapter and tests that expose this behavior (removing the call to AnnotationUtils will fail with a NullPointerException).
