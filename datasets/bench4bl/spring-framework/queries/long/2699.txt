when schemaUpdate is set to true, org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.LocalSessionFactoryBean fails to build Session Factory
because the method updateDatabaseSchema() is being called from the method buildSessionFactory before the instance variable sessionFactory is set.
the easy way to fix would be to move the lines 
// Execute schema update if requested.
		if (this.schemaUpdate) 
{
			updateDatabaseSchema();
		}

from the build sessionFactory to the afterPropertiesSet method.
