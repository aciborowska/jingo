If a bean has a property that has a public setter and a private/protected getter then BeanUtils.copyProperties attempts to call the non-visible read method and throws a FatalBeanException.
I'm not sure if that is the intended result, but here is a code snippet from line 135 of BeanUtils.java for release 1.0-m4 that changes the behavior to what I expect ():
if (targetDesc.getWriteMethod() != null &&
    sourceDesc.getReadMethod() != null &&
    (ignoreProperties == null || (!ignoreList.contains(name)))) {
    values.addPropertyValue(new PropertyValue(name, sourceBw.getPropertyValue(name)));
}
Thanks for an awesome framework!
