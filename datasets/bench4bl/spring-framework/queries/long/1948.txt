Checkout the following ref docs link...
http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/index.html
The CSS stylesheet is not being correctly resolved, and as a result the Spring reference documentation does not look as it should. It is still legible (of course), but it doensn't look as polished at it does when the stylesheet is correctly resolved.
So in effect, this issue is... put the stylesheet in the right place please.
