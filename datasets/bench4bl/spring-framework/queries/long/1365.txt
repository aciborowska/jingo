"autodetect" should auto-register Spring Beans as MBeans that meet certain criteria; however, you can't use the "autodetect=true" feature without at least explicitly specifying at least one bean to register via the MBeanExporter "beans" property.
The exact error is this:
Error creating bean with name 'mbeanExporter' defined in ServletContext resource [/WEB-INF/sellitem-servlet.xml]: Initialization of bean failed; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Must specify at least one bean for registration
