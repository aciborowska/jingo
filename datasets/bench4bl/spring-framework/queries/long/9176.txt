New entries are added to dependentBeanMap and dependenciesForBean map every time that a new instance of the request-scoped bean is created. This is because the proxy object representing the HttpServletRequest has a bean name like "$Proxy10@XXXXX" where XXXXX changes for each request. These entries are never removed, and eventually fill up the old generation. 
Attached is a web application which demonstrates the issue. Visit "http://localhost:8080/leak" repeatedly and watch the count increase.
