StaticLabeledEnum defines the readResolve-Method in order to replace deserialized instances with the existing VM instance.
However this method is not applied in subclasses of StaticLabeledEnum because it is private.
In java.io.ObjectStreamClass.getInheritableMethod only protected or public "readResolve" methods are matched.
Therefore the visibility of StaticLabeledEnum.readResolve should be changed to "protected".
