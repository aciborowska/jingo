While validating a form submission you can reject either field specific values (using rejectValue) or generic form issues (using reject). If you don't use proper error codes (because you don't want to use the Spring code/message system for example) then NoSuchMessageException exceptions will be generated. Basically you never get a chance to use the default message value.
Calling rejectValue with and empty or null error code will generate an exception regardles of your JSP code. Calling reject with an empty or null error code will generate an exception only if you try to bind to those errors.
