MockHttpServletRequest.setAttribute("attribute", null); throws a NPE but this is not the correct behavior according to the Servlet API:
http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.3/javadoc/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html#setAttribute(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object)
I think the problem should be easily fixed by converting the internal representation from using a Hashtable to using a HashMap.
