If you have a target Bean with singleton="false" and ProxyFactoryBean as the proxy (regardless in sigleton property is true or false), you can't proxy the first instance.
It appears the first instance is made before a request for it is even made from the context. If it is a prototype, shouldn't creation be deferred until it is requested from the context.
