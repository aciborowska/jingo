NestedServletException contains something like this:
	/**

Return the nested cause, or <code>null</code> if none.
	 */
	public Throwable getCause() 
{
		return (getRootCause() == this ? null : getRootCause());
	}

this is fine, unless getRootCause happens to call getCause.  tomcat's doesn't, but the JSDK shipping with resin does.  I will bring this up with the Caucho people, but it's not clear to me that they're wrong to do this.
it's also not clear how to fix this.  I don't really get the purpose of this method in the first place, but I doubt you'll be willing to just drop it at this point.  If you were to require a 1.4 JDK (where Throwable already has a getCause() method) you could perhaps get by with the default impl, but I get the feeling you don't want to require 1.4+.  another possibility would be to store the root cause directly in this class, rather than forwarding it up to the superclass.
