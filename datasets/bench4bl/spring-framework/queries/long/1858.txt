In the reference manual for version 2.0M3 it is stated in chapter 6.5.2 that CGLIB is used, when no proxy interfaces are defined. As far as I know, that is not true if the class in question does implement interfaces.
I suggest to clarify the reference manual concerning which proxy type is used by Spring under which conditions and how these behave (i.e.  which type(s) the proxy has)
