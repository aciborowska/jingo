If you have a radio button group bound to a form property like the following.
<form:form>
<p> Choose One </P
<form:label path="someProperty"><form:radiobutton path="someProperty" value="value1"/>Label One</form:label>
<form:label path="someProperty"><form:radiobutton path="someProperty" value="value2"/>Label Two</form:label>
</form:form>
The LabelTag will generate an ID value of "someProperty.label".  This doesn't work becuase it uses the same id value twice.  The RadioButtonTag on the other hand is smart enough to modify the id to be "someProperty1" and "someProperty2".
Solutions would be to either make the label tag act like the Radiobutton tag with respect to ID attributes, or in my opinion a better solution is to not output id attributes at all unless the user actually specifies their own id.  It just adds extra cruft to the html.
