It lookslike the AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory is only destroying inner beans if they implement DisposableBean. If they don't implement DisposableBean, but declare a "destroy-method", the destroy method is never getting called.
I ran into this with two beans that control external threads. The idioms used in these beans are identical. They both have a 'destroy-method' declared in the XML, which cause the thread to be interrupted and shutdown. One of these beans was declared at the top level with a name, the other was declared anonymously as an inner property definition in another bean. The top-level bean's destroy method is called at shutdown; the inner bean's was not.
This looks to have been been partially addressed in SPR-70, but it seems it's only honoring inner beans if they implement DisposableBean. But my understanding was that this isn't necessary, provided the 'destroy-method' is specified.
