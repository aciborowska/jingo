getting IllegalStateException because spring fails to properly identify a bridged method. need to check for type signature where the generic type has been replaced with Object since that is the signature the compiler generates for bridged methods
here is the stack trace, i am also attaching a test case
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'springtest.support.UserDaoImpl' defined in class path resource [springtest/ctx.xml]: Initialization of bean failed; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to locate bridged method for bridge method 'public volatile void springtest.support.UserDaoImpl.save(springtest.support.User)'
