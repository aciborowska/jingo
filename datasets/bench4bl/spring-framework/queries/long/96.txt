The DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor does not pick up inherited interfaces. As a consequence, when interface Foo extends Bar, then any attempt to introduce interface Bar using delegation to a FooImpl object will fail in DefaultIntroductionAdvisor.validateInterfaces (line 105).
The underlying cause is that AopUtils.getAllInterfacesAsList does extract all interfaces implemented by an object, but not their superinterfaces. This method's semantics are not clearly enough defined by the javadoc to say if this really a bug or not, but given the way it is being used I suspect that it is.
Fortunately, this issue is relatively easy to work around by declaring FooImpl to implement the Bar interface also, so this is not a critical bug.
