I've set singleton to false on the ProxyFactoryBean, so my proxied bean should be created on every getObject() (this works). 
But, when using the getBean(String name, Class requiredType, Object[] args) method on the AbstractBeanFactory it seems like it thinks its a singleton because it's in the singletonCache (the ProxyFactoryBean is always a singleton) but my target bean is not. The problem is that it skips the dependecy injecting stuff and I end up with an un-injected instance of my bean.
