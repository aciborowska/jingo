The AspectJ load time waeving configuration file aop.xml, found in <spring dir>\aspectj\src\META-INF\aop.xml, contains the wrong class name for the AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect.
It's currently configured as  "org.springframework.beans.factory.aspectj.AnnotationBeanConfigurer", where as it should be configured as "org.springframework.transaction.aspectj.AnnotationTransactionAspect"
