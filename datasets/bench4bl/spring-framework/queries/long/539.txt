When an application context does not contain a MessageSource bean under the special "messageSource" name, then Spring creates an empty, static, message source which is used just so it can handle calls on the MessageSource interface. But in this case, no delegation is done to any parent context message source, as it would if the context did have a declared message soruce.
I don't think this is correct; delegation should happen with or without a message source declared in the child.
