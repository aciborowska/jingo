There's a bug in OptionTag, in that it uses incorrect heuristics when
determining if it is inside a SelectTag.  The problem is, it uses the
existance of SelectTag.LIST_VALUE_PAGE_ATTRIBUTE in the pageContext.
If it doesn't exist, it will throw an IllegalStateException.
However, it's perfectly legal to not have a value for
LIST_VALUE_PAGE_ATTRIBUTE.  This can happen when the form is
displaying for the first time, and no value has been set for the
command bean.
If a command bean's property is null, then the call to
setAttribute(LIST_VALUE_PAGE_ATTRIBUTE, getValue()) will actually
perform a removeAttribute.
I suggest simply changing OptionTag to not throw an
IllegalStateException if there is no value for
LIST_VALUE_PAGE_ATTRIBUTE.  If it's null, it's null, oh well.
