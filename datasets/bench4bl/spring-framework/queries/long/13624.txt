UriTemplate allows for template variables to define a matching pattern.




These patterns are regular expressions. UriTemplate's inner class Pattern makes use




of a Regular Expression itself to identify variables in the template string. This Regular




Expression ("\\{([^/]+?)\\}") will match anything between a pair of curly brackets, where




a pair is an opening bracket and the next closing bracket. The problem here is that no




balancing is performed and thus template Regular Expressions containing a closing




curly bracket will lead to wrong parsing. Examples are Regular Expressions containing




literal brackets (\}) or certain quantifiers ({n}, {n,}, {,n}, or {n,m}), such as




"/path/{var:\\d{8}}".
