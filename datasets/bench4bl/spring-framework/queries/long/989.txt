The problem occurs on a standalone Swing application. Instead of a properly translated database exception I get a NullPointerException. The exception is thrown in core.io.ClassPathResource at line 144: cl is null. This happens because the Thread does not have a ContextClassLoader, so Thread.getContextClassLoader() returns null ..
