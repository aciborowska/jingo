Removing some of the nested exceptions, the error reported by Spring when an init-method of a bean is missing is, "org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'databaseManager' defined in file [c:\jakarta-tomcat-4.1.27\webapps\jrocservice\WEB-INF\conf\spring\spring-config-j2se.xml]: Initialization of bean failed; nested exception is java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: null".
It would be nice if the name of the method was included instead of "null"
