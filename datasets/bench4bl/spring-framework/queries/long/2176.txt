The tag org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.form.LabelTag overrides doFinally() of AbstractDataBoundFormElementTag (same pkg), but does not include a call to super.doFinally(). The result is that member bindStatus of AbstractDataBoundFormElementTag is not null'ed when doFinally() is run, as it would have been if LabelTag had included super.doFinally().
Easy way to visualize this bug is to set the cssErrorClass attribute of a LabelTag, and then create a field validation error bound to the property which the label is for. Body-text of the label is tagged with the correct CSS class, but after the validation error is corrected the label body is still tagged with CSS error class.
Suggestion - add a super.doFinally() between lines 114 and 115 of LabelTag:
	/**

Clean the 
{@link TagWriter}
 instance.
	 */
	public void doFinally() 
{
		super.doFinally();
		this.tagWriter = null;
	}
