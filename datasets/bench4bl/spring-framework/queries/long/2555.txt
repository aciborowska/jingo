I have a spring bean that I have added interfaces to using a cglib enhanced class.  If I attempt to create an aop proxy using "proxyTargetClass" then Cglib2AopProxy.getProxy() correctly uses the super class to create it's proxy.  However, in doing that I lose the interfaces that I applied when I custom enhanced the super class.
To fix this Cglib2AopProxy.getProxy() needs to add all of the interfaces previously applied to the proxied class that it strips away.  That way my proxied class does not lose it's types when Spring advices it.
