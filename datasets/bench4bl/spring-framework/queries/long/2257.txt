There are 2 chapter 2s 
Background information is the first chapter 2: http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/background.html
What's New in Spring 2.0? is the second chapter 2: http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/new-in-2.html
Also when I click on "4.16. Setting a bean property or constructor arg from a field value" I am sent to http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/beans.html#d0e4212 but that just brings me to the top of the page instead of to that section (it looks like that section might not be written yet)
Also it looks like the numbers are off for the IoC container chapter.  In the TOC "Glue code and the evil singleton" is section 4.20
but in the actual document that is section 3.9.  That link doesn't work either.
