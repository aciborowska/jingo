I found the getBlobAsBinaryStream() of the DefaultLobHandler doesn't match the behavior of the getBlobAsBinaryStream() of OracleLobHandler when comes to processing the NULL column. The former one will return a 0 byte stream while the latter one will return null value (because it uses jdbc's getstream). I think the DefaultLobHandler should also return a 0 byte stream, as following:
	public InputStream getBlobAsBinaryStream(ResultSet rs, int columnIndex) throws SQLException 
{
		logger.debug("Returning BLOB as binary stream");
		InputStream is = rs.getBinaryStream(columnIndex);
		return is != null? is:new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[0]));
	}
