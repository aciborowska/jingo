Was using 1.1rc1 and was getting NoClassDefFoundError in AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory extends AbstractBeanFactory but found that this was fixed in the current CVS version.  After building what's in CVS I get one more NoClassDefFoundError in AbstractApplicationContext which went away with similar code.
	static 
{
		ContextClosedEvent.class.getName();
	}
