Downloaded spring-framework-2.0-rc2-with-dependencies.zip and started following the MVC tutorial. Breaks in Step 14. Tomcat reports: 
org.apache.jasper.JasperException: /WEB-INF/jsp/hello.jsp(6,28) According to TLD or attribute directive in tag file, attribute value does not accept any expressions
I resolved it in my copy by editing c.tld in the standard.jar. I set   <rtexprvalue>true</rtexprvalue>  for attribute "value" in tag "out".
BTW: I see that the source for the MVC tutorial is out of date, e.g., docs/MVC-step-by-step/src/part1.xml, is newer than docs/MVC-step-by-step/Spring-MVC-step-by-step-Part-1.html. I failed to generate html using the downloaded jar dependencies.
