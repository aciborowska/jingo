According to "3.2.3.3. Bean creation via instance factory method"), beans should be able to be created with an instance factory method and behave as with a default (no-args) constructor, or sepecified constructor. 
However, when  you define a bean, say:
<bean id="N" factory-method="M" factory-bean="B">) 
then factory-method M is NOT called on startup (unlike for STATIC factory method beans) and ISN'T included when you do getBeansOfType(Object.class) (unlike other beans - constructor-injection, setter-injection, and STATIC factory method beans). 
The bean IS available when you do getBean(N) (and the method M only called when bean is requested by Name (each time...))
I have tried this with a return type (for M) of the same type as B and as a range of arbitrary other types...
Either the behaviour is wrong or 3.2.3.3 is wrong (or at least confusing).
Currently at least instance factory-method beans seem to be broken (yet this is true for 1.2.1, 1.2, 1.2RC1 and 1.1.5...
I think I can create a TestCase for this if helpful. (please request)
