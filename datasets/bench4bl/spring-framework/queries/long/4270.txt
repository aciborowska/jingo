ServerSessionMessageListenerContainer102 has to be  "autoStart=true",  Else it throws
org.springframework.jms.listener.AbstractJmsListen ingContainer$SharedConnectionNotInitializedExcepti on initialize.
It seems that shared connection is established only if autostart is on. But the doInitialize requires the shared Connection to be started.
