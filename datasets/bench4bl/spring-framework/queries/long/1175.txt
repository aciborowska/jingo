In the new Version 1.2.3 there has been a change in BeanWrapperImpl (as indicated in the changelog) that BeanWrapperImpl will pass along the old value to setAsText().
Currently I have the situation that I require the setter being invoked, before accessing the value. So I throw an exception if the property is not set on use. Since setting the value now invokes the getter first, the code breaks (it's a central thing and not easily changed).
Some sort of "compatibility mode" with the old behaviour would be nice.
