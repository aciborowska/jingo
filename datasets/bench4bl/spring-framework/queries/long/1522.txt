A BeanWrapperImpl does not pass its property extractOldValueForEditor = true on to newly created instances of nested BeanWrapperImpl classes. 
The data binder is (per default) configured with extractOldValueForEditor = true. BeanWrapperImpl instances use this property to pass old values into property editors. This works for top level beans.
However, when a value for a nested bean property is about to be set, a new BeanWrapperImpl instance is created with a default setting of extractOldValueForEditor = false. Thus, it is currently impossible to use a property editor that needs access to old values for nested bean properties.
I did not figure out any workaround for this issue.
