given the following urls
/users/user_name@website.com - Adds Content-Disposition f.txt
/users/user_name@website.com/ - functions as expected.
Controller Request Mapping is 





/users/{userId}






These urls both function as expected in 4.2.1
Please let me know if you need any other info.  In my mvc config i have suffix matching set to false.
