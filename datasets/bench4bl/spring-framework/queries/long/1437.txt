jdbcTemplate.queryForInt("select '15' from somewhere") fails.
This happens because JdbcTemplate calls ResultSet.getObject(), gets String, and cannot convert String to int.
According to JDBC specification, ResultSet.getInt() must convert varchar to int.
I think JdbcTemplate should not attempt convert getObect() to int, but rather delegate conversion to JDBC driver.
Thanks.
