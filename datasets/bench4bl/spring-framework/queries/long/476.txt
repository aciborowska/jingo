Hi Juergen, people,
I've got some post-processing (DB storage, emails etc) overriding the processFinish() method of AbstractWizardFormController.
While this has been executed several times, it now seems to be being bypassed. validatePage() is being called but I thought my 'success case' post-processing would be cleaner over in processFinish().
The on-finish view is being returned to the browser, yet the only reference to this is in processFinish(). I'm not sure if the controller or the browser might be caching here.
I've got 'sessionForm' set true.
My final link, to complete the wizard and begin file download, is a link along the lines of <a href="?_finish=y">Download</a>.
Any suggestions ?
Cheers,
Thomas
