As stated in the topics "Can JTA and JMS work together ?" and "WebSphere + JMS + XA" in the Spring Forum "Remoting and JMS" there is a problem when using JmsTemplate within a global transaction.
In JmsTemplate doSend() line 608:
if (session.getTransacted() && !TransactionSynchronizationManager.hasResource(getConnectionFactory())) {
// transacted session created by this template -> commit
session.commit();
}
The second condition always returns true because TransactionSynchronizationManager.bind() is not called anywhere. Therefore the session is committed locally which throws an IllegalStateException: "Method not permitted in global transaction" under WebSphere MQ.
Similar problem in doReceive().
