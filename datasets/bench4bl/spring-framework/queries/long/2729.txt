Once we schedule the Runnable object with WorkManagerTaskExecutor a WorkItem is returned to track the work submitted. There is a getResult() method in WorkItem to return the work object submitted. This method now returns the DelegatingWork object as it was used to submit the work. There is no method available currently to retrieve the actual Runnable object that is contained inside the DelegatingWork object. As the results are stored in the Runnable object and it needs to be retrieved for using the results. This problem can be solved by adding a getRunnable() method to DelegatingWork class and this method should return the contained runnable object.
Optionally the runnable objects could be saved to be reused later for results but I think adding above method provides a clean implementation and is in sync with how workmanager API is used.
