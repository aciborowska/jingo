It seems the sample jmx export in petclinic is wrong.
rather than
name="petclinic:service=hibernateStatistics"
it should say
name="petclinic:Name=hibernateStatistics"
Using the first, the bean never showed up.. in any jmx browser.
I still can't see it with mc4j but I see it now with ManageEngine Application Manager where I did not see it before.
I still can't understand why mc4j doesn't show it up. Maybe it's a weblogic thing. But I am happy exporter is working.
