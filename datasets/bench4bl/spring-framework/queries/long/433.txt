The official reference DTD in the documentation 
http://www.springframework.org/docs/reference/springbeansdtd.html
contains newer version of the DTD than the hosted version at
http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd
This causes some valid Spring 1.1.1 bean definition xml files to fail validation.
