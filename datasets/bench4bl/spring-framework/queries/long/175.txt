When using CGLIB Enhancer to generate a proxy, the Enhancer is generated with each instantiation. Each proxy instance the Enhancer creates can be reused as a factory (see net.sf.cglib.proxy.Factory) to avoid recreating the Enhancer configuration with the same callbacks during the next instantiation.
Attached is a revised version of Cglib2AopProxy.java class file - note the only changed method is the getProxy(ClassLoader cl) method.
