The <form:form> tag from the spring-form.tld does not actually support in code all of the attributes advertised in the documentation and tld. The tld lists the following supported attributes:
id
name
cssClass
cssStyle
lang
title
dir
onclick
ondblclick
onmousedown
onmouseup
onmouseover
onmousemove
onmouseout
onkeypress
onkeyup
onkeydown
<!-- Form specific attributes -->
commandName
action
method
enctype
onsubmit
onreset
The class, org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.form.FormTag only provides setters for these attributes (this list includes parent classes):
command
commandName
name
onsubmit
onreset
method
action
enctype
It appears the rest of the <form: tags inherit from a class hierarchy that provides most of these common attributes, the FormTag does not.
