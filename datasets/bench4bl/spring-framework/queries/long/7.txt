If the call to CallableStatementCreator.createCallableStatement(Connection) on line 548 of JdbcTemplate.java throws an SQLException, then the cs variable will remain null. This causes the cs.toString() to throw a NullPointerException on line 562 in the catch block. This effectively obscures the real problem.
