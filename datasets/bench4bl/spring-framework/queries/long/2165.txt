I can set a multidimensional array class with ClassEditor.setAsText("int[][]"), but when I try to get back the name with ClassEditor.getAsText(), I get "[I[]". 
The reason is that ClassUtils.forName() calls itself recursively for array classes, but ClassEditor.getAsText() only handles one array dimension and uses the default Java name for the others.
