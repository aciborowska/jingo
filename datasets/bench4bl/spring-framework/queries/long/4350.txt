i've tried to upgrade from 2.5 to 2.5.1 and i've found that context:annotation-config mechanism is badly broken. From debug log, i can read that classes were found as candidates to be scanned for annotation configuration, but they are never configured, although they have correct annotations (@Component). 
I've found "bad reason" why spring skips component. Mechanism skips class containing or using in any method code non static inner class (bytecode contains reference to that inner class). Anonymous inner classes are OK.
