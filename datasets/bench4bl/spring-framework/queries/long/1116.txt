Recent change to AbstractBeanFactory getType() causes all beans of the form <bean factory-method=""/> to be instantiated as soon as the container encounters a bean using autowiring.
This leads to an unpredictable (or at least, unexpected) order of bean instantiation.  Applications working under 1.2rc1 may fail under 1.2.2.
Just want to make sure the implications of this change to the getType() method are fully thought through.  Those of us using factory-method to make legacy code amenable to IOC could have a tough time with this change.
Is the run-time type returned by the factory-method really necessary here?  Couldn't we reflectively get at the return type of factory-method instead, and wouldn't that be good enough?  Or, could we not overload the class attribute of the bean?
