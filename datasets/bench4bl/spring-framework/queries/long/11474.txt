Code below






// this works, tagId is properly decoded




@RequestMapping(value = "/tag/{tagId}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)




public @ResponseBody SourceTag updateTag(@RequestBody SourceTag newTag, @PathVariable("tagId") String tagId) {




    return sourceService.updateTag(new SourceTag(tagId), newTag);




}




// but here it fails!




@RequestMapping(value = "/tag/{tagId}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)




public @ResponseBody SourceTag updateTag(@PathVariable("tagId") String tagId) {




    // something




}






When trying to access
/tag/mmm%C3%A6%C3%A6%C3%B8%C3%A5 as PUT with an object, the
pathvariable tagId contains the value "mmmææøå"
But when accessing
/tag/mmm%C3%A6%C3%A6%C3%B8%C3%A5 as DELETE
the pathvariable tagId contains the value "mmmÃ¦Ã¦Ã¸Ã¥"
After testing, the problem seems not to be using DELETE instead of PUT, but having a @RequestBody and not having one.
