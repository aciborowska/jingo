I am exporting beans as mbeans and accessign them via jconsole. However, if I also advise the same bean (eg, with around advice) then the mbean attribute access fails with an error indicating "Target method not found".
Attached is a psuedo test case, since I don't yet know how to use spring on the jmx client side. But also since the problem I am seeing is via jconsole. 
One thing to note is that the jmx attributes are /not/ defined on any interface, only the bean itself.
Also, this is running on jdk 1.5 using '-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote' to allow jconsole to connect.
Hopefully the psuedo test will be enough allow for repoducing the problem. If not, please let me know. In the mean time I will try to dig deeper to determine the cause of this problem.
