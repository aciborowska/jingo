I am using Spring in a stand-alone environment.   Spring creates and initializes my beans correctly and in a predictable order.   I can see it in the trace messages.   However when my application exits, I don't see the invoking of my cleanup.   I have a strong feeling that I should be calling a Spring cleanup message before exiting.
I should also say that I have experimented with Spring.   I am satisfied that Spring calls init and cleanup methods as described in the reference manual.   In my stand-alone application, I want to know how to exit gracefully.
Here is end section of my trace file.   The bean with the main() is called Exec.java.  You can see that the init() was called properly but when my application exits, my cleanup methods are not called.   I suspect that I am not exiting gracefully.
