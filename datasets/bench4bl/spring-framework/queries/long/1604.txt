AbstractApplicationContext.close() contains the lines:
  // If we registered a JVM shutdown hook, we don't need it anymore now:
  // We've already explicitly close the context.
  if (this.shutdownHook != null) 
{
    Runtime.getRuntime().removeShutdownHook(this.shutdownHook);
  }

AbstractApplicationContext.registerShutdownHook() should probably do something 
similar before registering a new shutdown hook. As far as I can tell, the current
code would register multiple shutdown hooks if registerShutdownHook() is called
more than once, and only the last one added could be removed in close().
