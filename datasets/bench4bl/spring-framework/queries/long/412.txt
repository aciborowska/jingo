When the below function is called with a ServletWrappingController I get an index out of bounds when called from a Struts forward. So for example if I'm doing action chaining action1 -> action2 then the context root is not on the request when passing through the wrapping controller so there is no need to take it off again. Please propose a solution. 
	public String getPathWithinApplication(HttpServletRequest request) 
{
		return getRequestUri(request).substring(getContextPath(request).length());
	}
