AbstractBeanFactory.getType() catches BeanCreationException, but does nothing except log a debug message.
This behavior completely hid an exception that occured in one of our bean factories in the afterPropertiesSet() method.
(We use a bean factory post processor to add TX support to our startup bean. The post processor issues a call to configurableListableBeanFactory.getBeansOfType(), causing the bean factories to be initialized, in order to do type checking.)
