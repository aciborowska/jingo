Trying to return a MultiValueMap from a ReSt service method results in an exception when calling writeNewLine on line 253 within writeParts after the first body part. The reason is that all the message converter added in the constructor of FormHttpMessageConverter (e.g. ByteArrayHttpMessageConverter), close the stream, by using the FileCopyUtils.copy method.
