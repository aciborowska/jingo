I'm trying to register a custom editor in a declarative way:
<bean id="customEditorConfigurer" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.CustomEditorConfigurer">
    <property name="customEditors">
        <map>
            <entry key="mypackage.myType">
                <bean class="mypacke.myEditor"/>
            </entry>
        </map>
    </property>
</bean>
The Editor gets initialized but isn't used for wrapping my type. If I register the same editor in the initBinder() method of my controller, everything works fine.
I already tried to find a solution by asking in the forum (http://forum.springframework.org/viewtopic.php?t=7797) but had no luck.
Is it a bug?
