Rod,
I was toying around with the aop benchmark last night and I couldn't set the ProxyFactoryBean.frozen property anymore. Initialization of the context throws an exception. So setting the frozen flag now doesn't allow you to add advisors anymore, even not when constructing the context in the first place .
I've added a test ('ProxyFactoryBeanTests.java' line 656 and 'frozenProxyFactoryBean.xml'). It's commented out for the moment.
EXCEPTiON:
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'frozen' defined in class path resource [wrongProxyFactoryTests.xml]: Initialization of bean failed; nested exception is org.springframework.aop.framework.AopConfigException: Cannot add advisor: config is frozen
org.springframework.aop.framework.AopConfigException: Cannot add advisor: config is frozen
