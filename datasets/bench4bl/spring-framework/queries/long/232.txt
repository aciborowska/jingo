When I tried to use the new feature of defining child beans, I encountered the following exception:
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Bean definition does not carry a resolved bean class
	at org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractBeanDefinition.getBeanClass(AbstractBeanDefinition.java:182)
	at org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory.getBeanDefinitionNames(DefaultListableBeanFactory.java:106)
	at org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory.getBeansOfType(DefaultListableBeanFactory.java:120)
What I did was similar to the example described in the reference documentation (chapter 3.5). I created a bean without class or parent specification to be used as a template for others.
The exception is thrown upon existence of such a bean, independent of its usage. If I specify a class, everything works fine.
Besides that: the exception thrown should be somewhat more verbose about which definition actually has a problem.
