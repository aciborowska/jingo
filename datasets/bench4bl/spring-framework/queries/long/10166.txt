1. Brand New Computer
2. Install JDK 1.6
3. Install Spring 3.1
4. On first Startup - multiple error message windows;
a - EGIT - Do I know if this matters? How the eff should I know. A massive error dialog shows up about EGit. It's one of many possible SCM utilities - why - I wonder - why - is there any error about this one lone, latest not-so-greatest SCM utility on a clean install.
b - cant remember and don't care anymore
5. Create, through Spring MVC template, a project. Immediately have 15 project errors. Do they matter - how the hell should I know?
6. New Tack - Click link to Spring MVC demo project. 35 errors right away. Do they matter - how the hell should I know. 35 errors * 6000 solution = a whole lot of pain
This is why, after 100K of education costs, and 20 years total time invested in education, with 15 years IT experience in IT industry, I HATE I.T. and just cant take it anymore.
If I can't take a brand new computer, do nothing other than follow the 'Get Started' link at SpringSource, and create a non-error filled default app based on a template, or install a non-error filled demo app, what can I say about the 'value' of Spring vs San Fran Framework from 1997 (that started this all), or J2EE - or it's many successors or immatators?
Let me ask you - do you honestly believe that this crap is even marginally better than San Fran from 16 years ago? Because the marketing material directly next to the 'Get Started This Is All You Need' link, in addition to the documentation and other materials available, seem to imply so.
Here is what has changed in the past 15 years - the words.
