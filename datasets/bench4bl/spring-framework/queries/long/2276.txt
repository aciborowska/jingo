PropertiesEditor should use text.getBytes("ISO-8859-1") to load the properties.
Currently, PropertiesEditor uses text.getBytes(), which converts chars to bytes using the platform default encoding:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#getBytes()
It then passes these bytes to Properties.load(), which uses ISO-8859-1: 
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.InputStream)
On a system that doesn't use ISO-8859-1 as the default encoding, this may lead to problems. (It works on Windows, whose default encoding is almost identical to ISO-8859-1, but many Linux systems use UTF-8).
