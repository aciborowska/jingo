I'm using the current version of Spring Framework that is in your CVS repository. When I tried to compile my app today, I got this compiler error:
isAssignmentCompatible(java.lang.Class,java.lang.Class) has protected access in org.apache.commons.beanutils.MethodUtils
-------------
MethodUtils.class is in the jar file "commons-beanutils.jar" in your CVS repository. I opened that jar up and checked the isAssignmentCompatible() method â€“ it is PUBLIC, not protected, as the compiler stated.
Now I know that isAssignmentCompatible() USED TO be protected in earlier versions of commons-beanutils so I suspected that some other jar file must include the older version of that class. Sure enough, I did a search and the old version was in the jar "cayenne-1.1.jar" in your CVS repository. In that old version, the method was protected. And the compiler was loading the cayenne jar before the beanutils jar.
Perhaps your CVS repository should include the "no dep" version of the cayenne jar (i.e. cayenne-nodeps.jar) instead of the one you are using?
For more info, see this bug report on Cayenne's site:

-----------------
On a related note, I also noticed that cayenne-1.1.jar is stamped with the "release-1-1-4" tag in CVS but it is NOT actually included in the official "spring-framework-1.1.4-with-dependencies.zip" release file that I downloaded from Sourceforge. I thought that was a bit inconsistent.
