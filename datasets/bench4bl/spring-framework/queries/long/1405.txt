When setting the fetch size with JdbcTemplate.setFetchSize, the attribute is only propagated to the JDBC driver when using some of the query methods in JdbcTemplate. When using the execute methods with a callback (StatementCallback, ConnectionCallback etc.), the fetch size is ignored and the JDBC driver default is used anyway.
