It seems that using @ComponentScan with an includeFilters set only works for top-level contexts, not for @Imported contexts? See the attached minimal example maven project: the LowLevelContext works correctly, but the HighLevelContext does not, even though all the HighLevelContext does is to @Import the LowLevelContext.
Stepping through in a debugger I found that different AnnotationMetadata implementations are passed to ConfigurationClassParser#doProcessConfigurationClass in the two cases:
For LowLevelContext a StandardAnnotationMetadata is used (and behaves correctly).
For HighLevelContext an AnnotationMetadataReadingVisitor is used, and seems to return an empty array from getAnnotationAttributes(ComponentScan.class.getName()).get("includeFilters"), which is incorrect.
