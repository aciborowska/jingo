http://www.springframework.org/docs/MVC-step-by-step/Spring-MVC-step-by-step-Part-1.html uses log4j.rootLogger in the example code, but the text above it still calls it log4j.rootCategory.
Even though they're basically equivalent, the former is preferred (http://www.mail-archive.com/log4j-user@logging.apache.org/msg00614.html).
Suggested fix: change 'rootCategory' to 'rootLogger'.
