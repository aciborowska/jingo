WARNING: Applying this filter to existing logic can cause issues that have not appeared before, through the use of a single Hibernate Session for the processing of an entire request. In particular, the reassociation of persistent objects with a Hibernate Session has to occur at the very beginning of request processing, to avoid clashes will already loaded instances of the same objects.
I guess "to avoid clashes will already loaded instances" should be "to avoid clashes WITH already loaded instances"
