If the fields on the JSP are submitted like "models['search'].type" and the getRequiredFields() in the DataBinder returns "models[search].type"  the DataBinder does not treat them as equal, whereas BeanWrapper correctly processes the above and successfully maps "models['search'].type" to "models[search].type" using the name cannonization.  The same goes for the allowedFields handling.
