The code examples in section 11.2.3 reads
RowMapper mapper = new RowMapper() ...
and
ParameterizedRowMapper mapper = new ParameterizedRowMapper() ...
Both RowMapper and ParameterizedRowMapper are interfaces. The above code won't compile without a concrete implementation of these interfaces. I guess such an implementation exists somewhere. I think the docs should mention how to get hold of this implementation.
