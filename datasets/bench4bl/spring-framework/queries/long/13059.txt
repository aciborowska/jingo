When using @JmsListener and a @SendTo the created MessagingMessageListenerAdapter always uses a DynamicDestinationResolver. When the used MessageListenerContainer is configured with a different DestinationResolver.
This is problematic in the case of using a JndiDestinationResolver. 
A fix could be to set the appropriate DestinationResolver in the setupMessageListener method of the AbstractMessageListenerContainer so that the appropriate one is used.
