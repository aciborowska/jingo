I have a SimpleURLHandlerMapping with the following entry:
<prop key="/projects/*">MVC:ProjectsController</prop>
This pattern should match "/projects/" but does not.  The source code has a comment saying that only the pattern "/projects/**" would match the string "/projects/".  (line 81: "// String is exhausted, only match if rest of pattern is **'s")
