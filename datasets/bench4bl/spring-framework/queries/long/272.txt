Today I just tried to upgrade the spring lib to 1.1 rc2 from 1.02. To my surprise, the JTA starts to fail after I replaced the old spring.jar. After I switch back to 1.02, everything works again (no code change).
I use spring in within SLSB CMT which is demarcated as Required, tx attribute of the spring interceptted method is PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW. The call failed no matter there is a tx started by the ejb client or not.
Here is the error I got with 1.1 rc2:

I took a look at the source and found the session object is null after executing the following line in SessionFactoryUtils. 
Session session = (this.jtaTransaction != null) ?
this.sessionHolder.getSession(this.jtaTransaction) : this.sessionHolder.getSession();
While during the whole debug tracing, all session objects seem to bound use the DEFAULT_KEY - which is just a blank object.
I'm using spring's JtaTransactionManager to set the TransactionManagerLookup, maybe there are some additional steps needed in this new version?
