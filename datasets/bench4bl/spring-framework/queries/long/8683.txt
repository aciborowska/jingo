AntPathMatcher.AntPatternComparator algorithm wrong for hierarchical matches,  Consider an incoming request
GET /hotels/foo/rooms
and two patterns that match
1: /hotels/
{hotel}
/**
2: /**
Intuitively 1 is more specific than 2, so the comparator should return negative with compare(1,2) (i.e. 1<2).  Unfortunately this is not the case because the comparator thinks that 2 is more specific because it has fewer matching points (wildcards + brackets).
