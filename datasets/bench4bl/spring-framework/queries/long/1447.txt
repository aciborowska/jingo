Even though the javadocs for MultiactionController indicate that a subclass can set the command name, there is no setCommandName() available.  Further more, the DEFAULT_COMMAND_NAME is set to final, and is used directly when creating the binder.
We should allow overriding of the command name, like we do for the BaseCommandController classes.  A simple setCommandName() would be perfect.
Also, I could be blind and not seeing it.  
Thanks!
