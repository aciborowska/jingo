When a proxy is created with the lookup-method injection, and dependency checking is switched on, then it complains for a previously non-existing property called 'callbacks'.
I figured out that it is because cglib proxies automatically implements the Factory interface which has this property exposed.
To fix this, please use the latest cglib and use the setUseFactory(false) on the enhancer instance of the instantiator.
