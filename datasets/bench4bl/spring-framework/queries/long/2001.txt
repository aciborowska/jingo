The scenario is similar to that described in SPR-1840. I tracked down the issue by just copying & executing the stored procedure example from the reference manual.
My analysis had following result:
In JdbcTemplate#extractReturnedResultSets the method CallableStatement#getUpdateCount() is invoked and the result is used as criterion in a do/while loop. Unfortunately there seems to be a bug in Oracle's jdbc driver (10.1.0.2.0; this is the version supplied with WebLogic 8.1SP4). This method erroneously returns 1, causing an endless loop. I know that this is no bug in Spring, but maybe the loop could be changed  to handle such failures more graceful.
As an aside: the driver versions 10.1.0.4.0 (provided with WebLogic 8.1SP5) and 10.2.0.1.0 do not show the erroneous behavior. Unfortunately I cannot change the JDBC driver at this time.
