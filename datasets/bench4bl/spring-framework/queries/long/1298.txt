We dropped the 1.2.4 Spring jars in to replace out 1.1.5 jars, and now the <replaced-method> configuration for some beans don't work.
We've got several parent beans that have a <replaced-method> element configured.
In 1.1.5, the child beans picked up the <replaced-method> definition from the parent, but don't under 1.2.4.
If we copy/paste the <replaced-method> definition from parent to child bean, the child bean now works, but we don't really see this as a fix due to the large number of child beans we'd have to change the Spring configuration for.
