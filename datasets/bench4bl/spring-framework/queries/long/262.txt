I have two xml files which are loaded using XmlBeanFactories, the former being the parent to the latter.  The first file defines a single POJO with two String properties.
<!-- Parent file -->
<bean id="myObject" class="test.MyObject">
   <property name="name"><value>Top-Level</value></property>
   <property name="owner"><value>Root</value></property>
</bean>
The second file inherits the first file's definition, defines a new class name (subclass of the parent's class), and overrides one definition.
<!-- Child file -->
<bean id="myObject" class="test.MyObjectSub" parent="myObject">
    <property name="name"><value>Child</value></property>
</bean>
When I test this code, the sub object does not inherit its parent's definition of "owner."  However, if I remove the new class definition, as seen below, then the new bean correctly inherits the parent's definition of "owner" and uses its definition of "name."
<!-- Child file without class override -->
<bean id="myObject" parent="myObject">
    <property name="name"><value>Child</value></property>
</bean>
