I'm attempting to inject a nullable value from a FactoryBean(see SPR-2119).  Fixing SPR-2119 has gotten me closer to my goal But I've found a place in AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory:287 that is throwing an exception when my FactoryBean returns a null result.  Would it be possible to remove this null check as well?
With the removal of this check I think I will finally be able to inject nullable values into my beans.
