When handling a POST request in a @RestController, the payload parameter annotated with @RequestBody can be null, regardless of the value of the required attribute.
Payload is JSON (content-type header is included) and deserialization is handled by Jackson.
In case it matters, the project is inheriting from spring-boot-starter-parent version 1.2.5.RELEASE.
