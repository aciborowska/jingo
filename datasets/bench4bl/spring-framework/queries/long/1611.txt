When I try to proxy a class using CGLIB, protected methods don't get proxied, i.e. protected method invocations are not intercepted.
As I found out this restriction is caused by this code fragment in class org.springframework.aop.framework.Cglib2AopProxy$ProxyCallbackFilter:
			// don't modify protected methods
			if(Modifier.isProtected(method.getModifiers())) 
{
				return NO_OVERRIDE;
			}

As I detected this restriction was added to solve problem SPR-357 (http://opensource2.atlassian.com/projects/spring/browse/SPR-357) witch was caused by CGLIB library. Currently used version of CGLIB library is fixed, so the fragment above doesn't fix anything but just restricts. Removing the fragment of code wouldn't make any unit test to fail.
