In class SimpleMappingExceptionResolver, the Exception mappings are iterated in a random order, so that if the user maps first sub-classes and then superclasses, the superclass may be hit first.
Example:
<property name="exceptionMappings">
	<props>
		<prop key="com.blah.MyException">oops</prop>
		<prop key="java.lang.Exception">error</prop>
	</props>
</property>
If com.blah.MyException is thrown, java.lang.Exception is hit before com.blah.MyException, so that the view "error" is returned instead of "oops".
Probable fix:
this.exceptionMappings = new HashMap(mappings.size());
Should be:
this.exceptionMappings = new LinkedHashMap(mappings.size());
