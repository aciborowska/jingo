I've run into a problem with the BridgeMethodResolver  where by it is throwing seemingly the random exception
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to locate generic definition for bridge method 'public volatile void com.tangler.manager.broadcaster.impl.MessageBroadcasterImpl.receive(com.tangler.server.core.channel.Event)'
Strangely this only occurs sometimes when starting my application, probably 50% of the time this work correct, then without any changes to the code base the application will fail to start with this exception.
