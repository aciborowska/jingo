There is a following problem - 
@Transactional applied to interface (or its method) behaves differently depending on value of proxy-target-class attribute of <tx:annotation-driven> tag,
namely:
1. If  proxy-target-class is false annotation on interface is granted and all behaves as expected
2. if proxy-target-class is true annotation on interface is ignored (unless duplicated in class itself)
As far as I understand it should affect not @Transactional only, but the whole Spring AOP, e.g. <aop:config> tag.
For me it is hard to say if it can be helped, but at least it shall be documented. Chapter 6.6. of Reference Guide (pages 108 and 109 in PDF) lists some issues with this property (for <aop:config> tag) but not this one, which IMHO is the most important of them.
I have to suggestions
1. Clearly document this behavior in separate subchapter and make direct reference to this piece of documentation from all affected tags.   
2. Extend syntax for <tx:transaction> and other affected "global" tags (if any) to allow filtering of classes affected by this property. <aop:config> is already able for such filtering. Another (simpler) alternative - provide in documentation an evident sample of <aop:configy> based configuration that is eqvivalent to <tx:annotation-driven> tag (as far as I understand it should exist).
