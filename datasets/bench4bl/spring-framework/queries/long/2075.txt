(Followup of SPR-1977)
The for attribute of a label references the id of the associated control and not the name !
(see http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.9.1)
So, the current implementation of the label tag won't work, because it sets the for attribute to the path expression which is used as the name for controls and not as the id.
