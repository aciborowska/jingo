I'm using special characters in my path. An error occurs while getting the handler for this path as soon as the uri contains special charaters. After a lot of tracing it seemed to result from the WebUtils.getLookupPathForRequest.
The method HttpServletRequest.getServletPath returns a decoded path, while all other returned paths are NOT decoded (according to J2EE spec). After I've added the decoding of the context path and request uri, it worked. This seems to be a bug in the framework. No tests broke because of the change.
The FIX:
In org.springframework.web.utils.WebUtils:
replace line 176 with:
> try 
{
>     uri = URLDecoder.decode(request.getRequestURI(), "UTF-8");
> }
 catch(UnsupportedEncodingException e) 
{
>     log.error("unable to decode the request uri", e);
> }

and line 191 with:
> try 
{
>     contextPath = URLDecoder.decode(request.getContextPath(), "UTF-8");
> }
 catch(UnsupportedEncodingException e) 
{
>     log.error("unable to decode the context path", e);
> }

It might be neccessary to make even more changes, but this seems to work at least for me. I would suggest adding some tests to the org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.PathMatchingUrlHandlerMappingTestSuite to include some paths like: 
> /test%26test/pathmatching.html
> /test%26test/path%26matching.html
> /test%26t%20est/path%20%26matching.html
