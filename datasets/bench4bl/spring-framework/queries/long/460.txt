I posted this on the forum and someone told me to create a JIRA issue, so here it goes(although I'm not sure it's really an issue as this is only happening in the sandbox) - basically a few classes from various packages in the sandbox are using 'enum' for variable names, which causes these classes fail to compile with javac 1.5.
