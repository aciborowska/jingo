FastByteArrayInputStream.read(byte[]) returns incorrect result when the read buffer is bigger than the InputStream contents. 






FastByteArrayOutputStream out = new FastByteArrayOutputStream();




out.write(new byte[42]);




System.out.println(out.getInputStream().read(new byte[43]));







Actual output: 41
Expected output: 42
The FBAIN implementation first reads all the available input, and a temporary read count of n is computed. Then it calls `read` again, which returns -1 (end of stream). That -1 is added to the read count, returning n-1 instead of n.
