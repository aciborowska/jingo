Hi !
In setViewClass(), if the viewClass is null, an NPE will be thrown instead of the expected IllegalArgumentException.  End result is the same - context won't start.
But, the information will not be the same.
Attached is a test case + a fix.
I would have liked to make a patch against CVS HEAD, but CVS is down, so I can't.  This is against Spring 1.1.1.
Bye !
