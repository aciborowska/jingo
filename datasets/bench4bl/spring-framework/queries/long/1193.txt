The error codes returned when binding Map values (and possibly other collections as well) isn't consistent.  They depend on the pre-bound values of the collection.



Scenario **
When binding to a single Map entry (e.g. entries[FOOBAR]), the error codes returned in BindException depend on whether or not the entry has an inital value of null or not.



In this case, I have a Map keyed by Strings and containing Long values.  I have a SimpleFormController with this custom editor in place:
binder.registerCustomEditor(Long.class, "entries", new CustomNumberEditor(Long.class, false));
My command class looks like this:
public class MemberMapping {
    private Map entries = new HashMap();
    public Map getEntries() 
{ return entries; }
    public void setEntries(Map entries) 
{ this.entries = entries; }
 
}
I'm binding the string "A", which obviously should raise an error because it cannot be converted to a Long.
If the form backing object contains an initial (pre-bind) entry: entries[FOOBAR]=null, then these codes are returned:
typeMismatch.mapping.entries[FOOBAR]
typeMismatch.mapping.entries
typeMismatch.entries[FOOBAR]
typeMismatch.entries
typeMismatch 
If the form backing object contains an initial (pre-bind) entry: entries[FOOBAR]=java.lang.Long(0), then these codes are returned:
typeMismatch.mapping.entries[FOOBAR]
typeMismatch.mapping.entries
typeMismatch.entries[FOOBAR]
typeMismatch.entries
typeMismatch.java.lang.Long // ** NOTE
typeMismatch 
I would think that the error codes should be the same.  Afterall it's not the previous value that we care about when binding, it's the new value.
This behavior makes it impossible to define generic error messages for  type conversion errors.  Instead of only defining a global message for code "typeMismatch.java.lang.Long", I must also provide scenario specific ones like "typeMismatch.entries".
I've attached a test case that demonstrates this problem.
There is a thread on the forums which discusses how this came to be in the first place. http://forum.springframework.org/viewtopic.php?p=29691
