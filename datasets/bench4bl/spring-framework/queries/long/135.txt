Spring contains a PropertyEditor that allows Spring to automatically populate boolean properties of JavaBeans, but doesn't have a PropertyEditor that allows for automatic population of java.lang.Boolean properties using the same syntax.  This property editor would be useful if you want to force a user of a class to configure a Boolean property before the class can be used (rather than specifying default values for the boolean property, which is required if you are using a primitive boolean).
I can provide a use case for this behavior and a stack trace of the error if needed.
