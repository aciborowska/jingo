I wanted to use ConfigurableMimeFileTypeMap to easily map some common file endings to their mime type.
All looked good until I got "application/x-pointplus" for a CSS resource (filename bla.css) where I would have expected the more commonly used "text/css".
Looking into org/springframework/mail/mime.types it became quickly clear that the "css" ending is mapped twice - it seems that the latter mapping won in this case.
I don't know if that is exactly a bug - I myself was quite surprised, and need to "workaround" now using a custom mime types mapping file.
No big deal but I thought you should be made aware of this "issue".
Best regards,
