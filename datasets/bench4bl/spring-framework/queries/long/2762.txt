This is just a packaging issue.
I have an ear file to deploy on weblogic.  The database access layer that uses hibernate is deployed at ear level (under APP-INF\lib, weblogic style).  There is a war file inside the ear that uses OpenSessionInViewFilter.  All hibernate support classes from Spring are by default stored in spring hibernate jar.  Then it comes to a problem: where should I put the spring hibernate jar file?
If putting it under ear level, the servlet filter can not deploy. Weblogic throws a NullPointerException without any meaningful message.  It really costed me a lot of time to find out the cause.
If putting it under war file's web-inf\lib, then the database access layer at ear level can not find the hibernate support classes like HibernateTemplate.  Data access layer is shared by multiple war files, so by no means we should put it inside the war file.
So finally I have to split the spring hibernate jar file into 2 parts. One contains the core, while the other has only servlet filters.  It works fine.
Even though I haven't tested it with spring 2.0, the issue should be there also.
