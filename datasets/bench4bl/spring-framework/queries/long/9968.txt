DeferredResult does not permit a value being set prior to the DeferredResult being returned by the controller's method.
This can be a problem given that some api can behave synchronously or asynchronously, and it is unknown whether the synchronous behaviour will occur. For example:






final DeferredResult<String> r = new DeferredResult<>();




doSomeApi(new Runnable() {




  public void run() {




    // This could be called within the calling thread or by another thread.




    r.setResult("someresult");




  }




}




return r;






My recommendation is to retain any results processed by DeferredResult and act upon them once a result handler is associated.
