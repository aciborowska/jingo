There are two issues:
1. Spring ASM has no 3.2.0.RELEASE version in Maven Repo. The latest version of Spring-ASM is 3.1.3.RELEASE
2. In Spring-Core 3.2.0.RELEASE, the class LocalVariableTableParameterNameDiscoverer has a private class ParameterNameDiscoveringVisitor which extends an interface org.springframework.asm.ClassVisitor (defined inside Spring-ASM); whereas in Spring-Core 3.1.3.RELEASE the same class extends org.springframework.asm.commons.EmptyVisitor (which is not an interface).
Because of the issue #2, the deployment (of my WAR file) is breaking in JBoss 7.1.1
