If you look at the MailSendException class' printStackTrace methods, note the first line:
if (this.messageExceptions.length == 0) {
The messageExceptions variable is only not null if you call the MailSendException(Map failedMessages) constructor. The other two constructors do not initialize the messageExceptions variable to a value and thus when printStackTrace is called a NullPointerException is thrown. Our code (and one of our unit tests that exposed this to me) calls:
throw new MailSendException("boom");
And thus breaks.
It's really as simple as not referencing messageExceptions directly but using the getter instead, which is what it's there for.... It has a null check in it and will return an empty array if the variable hasn't been initialized yet. Nicely done, it's just not being used.
And by the way, that you very much for 2.5. It was quite easy to migrate to.
