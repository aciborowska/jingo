See http://www.springframework.org/docs/api/org/springframework/transaction/interceptor/TransactionAttributeSourceTransactionAroundAdvisor.html#ORDER_VALUE : "Most advice will want to run within a transaction context, so we set the order value to be quite high. Other advisors can use a higher value than this if want to ensure that they always run within a transaction context."
These two sentences contradict each other. The first suggests that high-Ordered advice is layered on top of low-Ordered advice. The second sentence suggests the opposite.
