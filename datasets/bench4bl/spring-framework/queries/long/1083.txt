I had an issue with configuring org.springframework.ui.velocity.VelocityEngineFactoryBean, property "resourceLoaderPath".
If I configure it as the example in the JavaDoc says, Velocity does not find the templates.
<property name="resourceLoaderPath">
  <value>file:/WEB-INF/velocity/</value>
</property>
The file: prefix makes it look for an absolute path. I replaced it with 
<property name="resourceLoaderPath">
  <value>/WEB-INF/velocity/</value>
</property>
and this makes the path start from the Web Application root path.
