FileNotFoundException gets thrown in XmlBeanFactoryTests.testFileSystemResourceWithImport on Windows if path contains spaces. URL.getFile() will return "%20" for spaces in path making returned path string not usable for constructing File. URL.toURI().getPath() should be used instead.
See this java bug for more details.
Attaching a patch XmlBeanFactoryTests.java.patch which fixes the issue.
