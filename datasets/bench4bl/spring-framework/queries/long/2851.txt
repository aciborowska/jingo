Two spring-beans using HibernateTemplate.
The first uses PROPAGATION_REQUIRED, the second PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW as transaction attribute.
This works fine with jboss 4.0.2 but in jboss 4.0.5 the following exception is thrown:
IllegalStateException: Trying to change transaction in enlist!
This may be related to SPR-1384 but the workaround suggested there does not work in my case.
Even with transactionSynchronization=SYNCHRONIZATION_NEVER and hibernate.connection.release_mode=after_statement the exception occurs.
What makes me wonder is, that the same setup using JdbcTemplate works fine in both jboss 4.0.2 and 4.0.5.
I also did the transaction suspension / resume using JTA and javax.transaction.TransactionManager and that worked fine too with hibernate API and jboss 4.0.5 .
So it seems that HibernateTemplate is part of the problem.
Remarks:
I checked that with spring 1.2.5, 1.2.8 and 2.0.final - all behaved the same.
Currently my workaround is to use HibernateTransactionManager instead of JTATransactionManager  and that works even for JdbcTemplate based DAOs.
