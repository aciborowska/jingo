Using ConfigurableMimeFileTypeMap I found out, that for any file with extension "css" - ie. HTML stylesheets method getContentType(...) returns "application/x-pointplus" instead of expected "text/css". Firefox gets confused and refuses such stylesheets.
Problem is in double definition of mimetype for extension "css" in mime.types file included in spring.jar in package org/springframework/mail/javamail/
Exactly:

TEXT TYPES

text/x-speech				talk
text/css				css
and then:

PRESENTATION


PowerPoint presentation (Microsoft)
application/mspowerpoint		ppz
PointPlus presentation data (Net Scene)
application/x-pointplus			css
ASAP WordPower (Software Publishing Corp.)
application/x-asap			asp
Astound Web Player multimedia data (GoldDisk)
application/astound			asn

Next definition overwrites the previous one, which IMHO is more important.
