Spring is attempting to load modules that I am not usnig at all.  Why?  Is there a hidden configuration file or something?  Here is the message: "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: groovy.lang.GroovyObject".
It's giving me an exception and recovers from the exception.  That's not how I want Spring to behave.  How can I make it that Spring only loads the absolute minimum?
I can't figure out how to resolve this even after browsing the Spring Reference Manual.
