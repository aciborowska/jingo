A web application using the Log4jConfigServlet cannot be reloaded. The Log4jConfigurer uses the class WebUtils to set the WebappRoot (as a system property). If this property is already set, an IllegalStateException is thrown.
This condition is true if the same web app is loaded twice (i.e. if a servlet class changes or a jsp file). This functionality is core to any app server.
