If I'm understanding things correctly, 
in section 5.10.2 of the reference manual 
http://www.springframework.org/docs/reference/aop.html#aop-autoproxy-metadata 
I believe the following phrase 
"The DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator bean definition--called "advisor" in this case, but the name is not significant ..."
should read
"The DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator bean definition--called "autoproxy" in this case, but the name is not significant ..."
Or, in the quoted declaration, the XML should
read 
  <bean id="adviser" ...
If the latter change is made, a coordinated change 
must also be made in the jpetstore/attributes sample 
code, i.e., in WEB-INF/declarativeService.xml, line 26, 
so that any person who is trying to coordinate the 
reference manual with the actual example doesn't
get confused or lost.
