The issue could be revealed if MyBatis for Spring is used.
MapperScannerConfigurer in MyBatis for Spring v1.1.0+ has changed to use BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor instead of BeanFactoryPostProcessor as of v1.0.x for scanning MyBatis mapper resources.
The case is postProcessBeanDefinitionRegistry(BeanDefinitionRegistry beanDefinitionRegistry) is not called by Spring container if MapperScannerConfigurer is created through @Bean (but it will be called if the bean is created through XML configuration)
