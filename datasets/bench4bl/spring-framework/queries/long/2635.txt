The Javadocs for this method say: Does not override values if already present, to not conflict with Servlet 2.4+ containers.
The checks appear to be wrong:
		if (request.getAttribute(FORWARD_REQUEST_URI_ATTRIBUTE) != null) 
{
			request.setAttribute(FORWARD_REQUEST_URI_ATTRIBUTE, request.getRequestURI());
		}
		if (request.getAttribute(FORWARD_CONTEXT_PATH_ATTRIBUTE) != null) 
{
			request.setAttribute(FORWARD_CONTEXT_PATH_ATTRIBUTE, request.getContextPath());
		}
etc.
Shouldn't that be == null? The attributes do not appear to be set correctly on Servlet 2.3 containers as a result of this.
