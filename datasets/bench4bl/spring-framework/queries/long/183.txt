This shows up when the PagedListHolder is not kept in the session but created and bound on every pagination request.  When you bind the request paramaters order is important for the setPage and setPageSize methods.  If setPage is called before setPageSize their is a possiblity that the desired page will be set to 0, getNrOfPages() is dependent on pageSize.  Solution is to move this logic to the gettter methods.
public void setPage(int page) {
  if(page >= this.getNrOfPages()) 
{
    this.page = this.getNrOfPages() - 1;
  }
 else 
{
    this.page = page;
  }
}
public void setPageSize(int pageSize) {
  if(pageSize != this.pageSize) 
{
    this.pageSize = pageSize;
    this.page = 0;
  }
}
