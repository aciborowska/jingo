The generated POM files for Spring 3.2.1 have inadvertently changed several compile time dependencies to optional, namely:






spring-orm




-> spring-tx




-> spring-jdbc




 




spring-webmvc




-> spring-context




-> spring-web




 




spring-test




-> spring-webmvc






The root cause of issue is:
https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework/commit/7f928e83ffb3abdd62f9a1dc4ed1062bfc3b06f6
This commit intended to change the scope only within the project being merged and not in the 'merge.into' destination.
