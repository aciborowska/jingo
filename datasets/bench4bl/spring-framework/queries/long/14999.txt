Scenario
A web application using Spring 5.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT, Spring Boot 2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT and Spring Web Reactive does server-side rendering and needs to serve static resources, such as images and CSS style sheet files.
Server is Tomcat (though it seems to affect all servers, or at least several).
Observed Results
All static resources: images, CSSs, etc, are being served with Content-Type: application/octet-stream. This causes e.g. CSS style sheets not to be rendered by browsers:

Example Repository
I'm creating a Spring Web Reactive-enabled version of Thymeleaf's STSM example application at the thymeleaf/thymeleafexamples-stsm-reactive repository on GitHub: https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleafexamples-stsm-reactive/tree/SPR-14999 (tag: SPR-14999)
It can be executed with mvn -U clean compile spring-boot:run. The URL shown above (http://localhost:8080/css/stsm.css) can be used for testing this issue.
