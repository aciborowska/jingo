We tried to upgrade Spring framework from 2.5.5 to 3.1.1, during performance test we found that TransactionInterceptor will add some performance overhead because introduce of following method:
org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionAspectSupport.methodIdentification(java.lang.reflect.Method,java.lang.Class)
This new method will call Class.getDeclaredMethods() instead of using the method passed in directly.
If there are multiple transaction pointcuts defined and invoked in one call, the performance will be affected badly.
Can we do fallback support as 2.5.5 or add cache support for the method instead of call Class.getDeclaredMethods() each time?
