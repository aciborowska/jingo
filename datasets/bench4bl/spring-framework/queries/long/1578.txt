When running the org.springframework.core.io.support.PathMatchingResourcePatternResolverTests.testClasspathStarWithPatternOnFileSystem() after instrumenting the classes with CLOVER the test fails. This happens because clover creates its own classes in the same location as well. Therefore the number of classes does not match the expected number.
I've attached a patch that simply ignores all clover specific classes (that is all classes containing "$_CLOVER" in their name.
