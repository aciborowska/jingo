Hi,
I have a property setFile(java.io.File) which was previously wired up with a system property that evaluated to "c:/somedir" (note the lack of file: prefix).
In S2.0M3 this is still converted into a file, but the filename is prefixed with the working directory, so the filename is something like "c:/apps/jboss/server/default/tmp/project.war/c:/somedir".  Which obviously doesn't work.
Changing the system property to "file:/c:/somedir" does of course work, but it is a change in behaviour from Spring 1.2.x.
Thanks all.
