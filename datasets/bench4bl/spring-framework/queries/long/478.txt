When binding my beans to the JmxMBeanAdapter, I found that they're exported (and therefore instantiated) BEFORE PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer has done its work. 
E.g. for my datasource, this leads to errors like:
Cannot instantiate driver, caused by ClassNotFoundException: $
{db.driver}

and the like..
