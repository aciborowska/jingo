In the manual (page 17) there is example:
InputStream is = new FileInputStream("beans.xml");
XmlBeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(is);
There isn't such constructor for XmlBeanFactory.
It should look like that:
InputStream is = new FileInputStream("beans.xml");
XmlBeanFactory factory=new XmlBeanFactory(new InputStreamResource(is));
