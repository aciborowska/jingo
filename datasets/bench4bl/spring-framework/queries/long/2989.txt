CVS still had this issue as of this post.
form:errors generates a span tag with a name attribute. name is not a validate attribute for span.
example:
<form:errors path="message" cssClass="error"/>
resulted in:
<span id="emailAddress.errors" name="emailAddress.errors" class="error">Email address required</span>
