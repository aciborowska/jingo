If default init method is "afterPropertiesSet()" this method is called twice for beans implementing "InitializingBean". 
This is due to the implementation of 
protected void invokeInitMethods(String beanName, Object bean, RootBeanDefinition mergedBeanDefinition)
in AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory
There should a check if the method was already called.
