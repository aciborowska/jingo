Suppose there is a class 






@Controller




@RequestMapping("/foo")




public class FooController{




 




        @RequestMapping(value="/{id}", method=RequestMethod.GET)




	public String viewFoo(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {




		...




	}




 




}






After applying an advice (e.g. using <aop:aspectj-autoproxy proxy-target-class="true"/>), a proxy class instance will be used as a controller. However, the framework will try use information from the proxy class to handle the request, which will result in various errors (e.g. parameter mappings are not available due to the fact that @PathVariable is lost, etc).
A suggestion in this case would be to detect that the controller is in fact a proxy and to try to read the metadata from the target class.
