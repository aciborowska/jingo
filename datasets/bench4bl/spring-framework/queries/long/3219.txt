When using the <form:options> tag where the items data is a Map, the itemLabel and itemValue attributes are ignored.  Instead, the rendering logic simply uses the toString() of the map key for the option's value, and the toString() of the map value as the option's label.  This isn't much use when either the map key or value is a bean.
A more sensible approach would be to use the itemValue attribute to retrieve a property of the map key, and the itemLabel attribute to retrieve a property of the map value.
Alternatively, since Map.Entry is itself bean-compliant, the itemValue and itemLable values could be used as properties of the Map.Entry, e.g. itemValue="key.x" or itemLabel="value.y"
This was previously raised as SPR-2660, but I thought it warranted a bug report.
