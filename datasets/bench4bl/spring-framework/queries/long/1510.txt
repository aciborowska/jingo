here is the detail from an attempt to find someone on the #spring chanel on irc.freenode.net
bdudney: hi - anyone around that knows about the spring POM associated with http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/springframework/spring/1.2.5/spring-1.2.5.jar?
[10:52pm] bdudney: it appears that the POM is busted
[10:52pm] sleestak: i haven't used that.
[10:53pm] bdudney: i get this error when trying to build my project that depends on the pom
[10:53pm] bdudney: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/oUZAPx84.html
Thanks!
