Upgrading from 1.2.6 to 2.0 RC1 causes this to happen in some of my controllers:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Model object should not be null
        at org.springframework.util.Assert.notNull(Assert.java:113)
        at org.springframework.ui.ModelMap.addObject(ModelMap.java:75)
        at org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView.addObject(ModelAndView.java:238)
It's not really a big problem, but I thought you guys should be aware of it as it does cause compatibility issues.  Out of curiosity, why can't we have a null model object?
