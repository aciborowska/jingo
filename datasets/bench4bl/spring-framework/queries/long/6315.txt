This is a deliberately refiled duplicate of SPR-6159, which was originally filed as a "refactor", and I think it perhaps should be "bug".
Between 3.0.0 M4 and RC1, the protected parseStringValue method disappeared from PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer. For custom subclasses, this method was the main entry point into the superclass functionality. Since it had not been deprecated, it seemed like the correct thing to do, but has now been removed, breaking compile-time compatibility between 2.5 and 3.0.
Can the method be reinstated somehow, that perhaps invokes the new methods that do the work? It can then be marked as deprecated.
