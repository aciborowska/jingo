I think that I found a bug in BeanWrapperImpl class. Here is a description.
If you register custom property editor for element of map property (i.e. myMap[date]), and if you try to put, say, String (instead of Date) to that element, then NullPointerException will pop up from TypeMismatchException constructor. Problem lies in line 878 of BeanWrapperImpl which tries to construct TypeMismatchException with parameter requiredType set to null. Then, during creation of his error message, TypeMismatchException will call requiredType.getName() which will produce NPE.
If you need I can provide some simple examples which verify this.
