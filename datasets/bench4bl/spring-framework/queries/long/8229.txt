When an ApplicationContext is closed, any @Configuration class that was registered in that context does not get garbage collected.  If I understand the way class loading works, this is because the ClassLoader still holds a reference to the enhanced Configuration class.
This is a problem for me because I want to create ApplicationContexts at runtime.
