It is currently not possible to use JTA transactions with the OpenSessionInViewFilter, this is because the JTATransactionManager does not (and can not) set the flush mode of the Hibernate session away from FlushMode.NEVER - as a result an InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException is thrown from the HibernateTemplate when non-read-only transactions are attempted.
I am unsure as to the solution to this problem however i thought i should bring it to your attention. One thing that confuses me is that in the javadoc for OpenSessionInViewFilter it states:
"This filter works similar to the AOP HibernateInterceptor: It just makes Hibernate Sessions available via the thread. It is suitable for non-transactional execution but also for middle tier transactions via HibernateTransactionManager or JtaTransactionManager. In the latter case, Sessions pre-bound by this filter will automatically be used for the transactions and flushed accordingly. "
...which leads me to assume that the ability to use the filter with JTA transactions was ment to be included however that this functionality has not been implemented.
