Setting 'autoStartup' property to 'false' on ServerSessionMessageListenerContainer causes an exception during initialization of the MDP container. Basically, autoStartup prevents the Connection from being setup, but something else in ServerSessionMessageListenerContainer#doInitialize needs (or expects) that Connection to be valid.
Can provide full stack, if needed.
