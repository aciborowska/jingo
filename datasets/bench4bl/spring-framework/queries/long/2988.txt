UrlFilenameViewController now does its own (incorrect?) view name parsing as opposed to delegating to:
http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/api/org/springframework/web/util/WebUtils.html#extractFilenameFromUrlPath(java.lang.String)
as stated in the javadoc. This change differs from the funcitonality in 1.2.8 in the following way:
with bothUrlFilenameViewController versions mapped to the url "/foo/**" and a request for "/foo/bar/filename.jsp" is received
1.2.8: uses the functionality in WebUtils to return "filename"
2.0: uses an internal implementation to return "bar/filename"
Was there a decision to update UrlFilenameViewController to take this new approach? If so, the documentation must be updated. This is related to issue SPR-2987
