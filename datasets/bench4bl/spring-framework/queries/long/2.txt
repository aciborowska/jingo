A fresh checked out CVS copy of spring fails to pass
the test :
org.springframework.web.servlet.view.xslt.FormatHelperTests
testDateTimeElement
Interestingely enough I am in the US using a US locale,
when the test is referring to a UK locale.....
The following asserts do not pass because :
"day-of-week"="Tuesday" not Wednesday
"day-of-month"=23 not 24
el = (Element)
e.getElementsByTagName("day-of-week").item(0);
assertTrue(
"Wednesday".equals(el.getFirstChild().getNodeValue() ));
el = (Element)
e.getElementsByTagName("day-of-month").item(0);
assertTrue(
"24".equals(el.getFirstChild().getNodeValue() ));
I have no idea on how to provide a resolution.
I leave to you .
Please note that the last check-in you made was about
that very same test (see version 1.5 change log)
"mysteriously fails on some installation"
On mine, hours="3", not 12....
BTW, it is not very explicit to use assertTrue for
strings, when assertEquals is much more explicit, and
assertEquals with a description is always preferred.
