Basically, I have a controller which is an interface where I put every annotations on that interface and when I implement that interface, apparently RequestHeader is not picked up.
If I repeat myself and put the RequestHeader in the implementation, it will work fine.
Shouldn't this annotation work the same as the other annotations? I think I've tried almost all annotations and they are picked up correctly.
I've attached a example.
