I created a really simple SimpleFormController and a corresponding velocity template "foo.vm". The template contains the folloging form:
<form action="" method="POST">
    #springFormInput( "command.message" "" )
    <input type="submit" value="submit"/>
</form>
I want the form being pre filled with the message from the command object.
But when accessing the form I get the following error inside the tomcat log:
2006-04-09 09:46:21,828 ERROR [org.apache.velocity.app.VelocityEngine] - RHS of #set statement is null. Context will not be modified. foo.vm [line 4, column 1]
2006-04-09 09:46:21,828 WARN [org.apache.velocity.app.VelocityEngine] - org.apache.velocity.runtime.exception.ReferenceException: reference : template = foo.vm [line 2,column 28] : $
{status.expression} is not a valid reference.

 is not a valid reference.
In the constructor of my controller I set the following properties:
		setCommandClass( MyCommand.class );
		setCommandName( "command" );
		setSessionForm( true );
		setBindOnNewForm( true );
In general accessing the command object works (I can output the message).
I tried to overwrite the method "formBackingObject" but that didn't change anything.
Do I have to call some binding methods by hand? Or is this a bug?
