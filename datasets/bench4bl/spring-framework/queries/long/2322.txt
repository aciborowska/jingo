With the following configuration:
<bean id="parent" abstract="true" class="com.bar.Foo">
  <property name="prop">
    <list>
       <ref bean="somebean"/>
    <list>
  </property>
</bean>
<bean id="child" parent="parent" class="com.bar.Foo">
  <property name="prop">
    <list merge="true">
       <ref bean="someotherbean"/>
    <list>
  </property>
</bean>
where Foo has a typed collection of objects, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown from the PropertyTypeConverter due to the fact that the ManagedList merges values into an instance of ArrayList, instead of ManagedList.  This in turn causes the BeanDefinitionValueResolver to not resolve the references in the group property as the value of prop will be an instance of ArrayList instead of ManagedList.
This occurs for all collection types.
