Desktop application (swing client) is executed via web start. While application context is instantiated application performs many (122 times) http get requests for resources which don't exist. This of course has huge impact on time that is needed to application startup based on you network connection.
Here is a sample of access log (each entry is requested multiple times which in total for one time application execution gives 122 requests to the server):
127.0.0.1 - - [07/Mar/2012:15:07:24 +0100] "GET /neo-web/webstart/org.springframework.aspects.jar HTTP/1.1" 404 952 "-" "Java/1.7.0_03"
127.0.0.1 - - [07/Mar/2012:15:07:28 +0100] "GET /neo-web/webstart/org.springframework.beans.jar HTTP/1.1" 404 952 "-" "Java/1.7.0_03"
127.0.0.1 - - [07/Mar/2012:15:07:31 +0100] "GET /neo-web/webstart/org.springframework.core.jar HTTP/1.1" 404 952 "-" "Java/1.7.0_03"
127.0.0.1 - - [07/Mar/2012:15:07:36 +0100] "GET /neo-web/webstart/org.springframework.aspects.jar HTTP/1.1" 404 952 "-" "Java/1.7.0_03"
127.0.0.1 - - [07/Mar/2012:15:07:42 +0100] "GET /neo-web/webstart/org.springframework.web.jar HTTP/1.1" 404 952 "-" "Java/1.7.0_03"
127.0.0.1 - - [07/Mar/2012:15:07:51 +0100] "GET /neo-web/webstart/org.springframework.context.jar HTTP/1.1" 404 952 "-" "Java/1.7.0_03"
This is reproducible every time application is executed via webstart (javaws http://localhost:8080/neo-web/webstart/launch.jnlp). It can be reproduced only in java web start environment because there is JNLPClassLoader involved which indirectly causes jars lookup on the backend server.
I enclosed stacktraces on which you can see class lookups and then calls to the servers. In stacktrace2 - stacktrace3 I noted parameter which was used in method invocation JNLPClassLoader
JNLPClassLoader(ClassLoader).loadClass(String) line: 356	<----------- parameter is org.springframework.beans.factory.aspectj.AbstractInterfaceDrivenDependencyInjectionAspectBeanInfo  --------->
The stacktrace1 is different than stacktraces 2-5 as the source of class loading is different. The latter (2-5) are pretty the same for most calls to the server (they differ only with different classes to be loaded)
