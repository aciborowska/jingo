Spring cannot instantiate a class in the DI container if the class was modified by AspectJ with @DeclareParent if the interface of the introduction declare a method that throws an exception. I attached a simple sample. I am not sure whether this is a bug in Spring or AspectJ. The Sample also includes the class files as AspectJ has compiled them.
