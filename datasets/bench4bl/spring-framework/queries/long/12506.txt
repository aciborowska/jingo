When having a controller package structure like:

my.controller
	
server
user
group


my.other.controller
	
role
permission



and no controller exists in package my.controller but in sub-packages server, user and group the @ControllerAdvice is applied to all controllers instead of only the ones in package my.controller.
So, for example, following the above package structure if I would like to have two different @ControllerAdvice, one for all controller contained in the package my.controller and another one for the ones contained in my.other.controller I need to add a dummy controller on each package in order to apply the correct advice.
The controller advice documentation points out that you should consider to have such a dummy controller in order to reference it from the advice

Class<?>[ ] basePackageClasses()
Type-safe alternative to value() for specifying the packages to select Controllers to be assisted by the @ControllerAdvice annotated class.
Consider creating a special no-op marker class or interface in each package that serves no purpose other than being referenced by this attribute.
As other usages of the same kind of annotation property (e.g. @ComponentScan.basePackages) I expected not to have such a dummy controller but let the framework find them in the sub packages
