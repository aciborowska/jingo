Autowiring of actions no longer wires up MessageSource.  This was working a little while ago, but the latest sync breaks it.  Stepping through the source shows MessageSource is explictly excluded from autowiring (handled separately by application context?)  Not sure what changed to break it, but something in the past 2 weeks or so...
