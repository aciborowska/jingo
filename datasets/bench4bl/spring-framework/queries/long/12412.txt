I have a bean that takes as an optional autowired argument a Collection<String> of "interesting" keys to watch for. Spring has a hard assumption that this means that the DI container should collect beans of type String and autowire that; there's no way (at least in JavaConfig, and this looks to be a DI algorithm problem) to autowire a bean of type Collection<String>.
The specific error is 






org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type [java.lang.String] found for dependency [collection of java.lang.String]
