Oracle error 17447 is currently an unmapped exception but it should be a DataAccessResourceFailureException.  This error occurs when a JDBC connection has become corrupted, usually because of failure to properly close a connection before returning the connection to the connection pool.  Here is the error message:
SQL state [null]; error code [17447]; OALL8 is in an inconsistent state; nested exception is java.sql.SQLException: OALL8 is in an inconsistent state
    java.sql.SQLException: OALL8 is in an inconsistent state 
This is a kind of "oh crap, something bad happened and it's not really your fault" exception in Oracle.  A few causes of this message are suggested in my searches on Google, including (see http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=274018&tstart=0):

use of Oracle 10g JDBC drivers to connect to Oracle 9 databases
using too big an array size (9.0.1 Database, 10.1.0 JDBC Driver and Generated Code that passes in an ARRAY or VARRAY of VARCHAR2 as a Parameter )

In any case, after this exception is thrown the connection is corrupted and unusable, hence why I advocate this exception be mapped to a DataAccessResourceFailureException
