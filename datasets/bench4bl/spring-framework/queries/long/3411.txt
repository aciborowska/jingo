Lots of people seem to be copying and pasting the XML documents for the Spring reference manual.  There are several examples that look like this.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.0.xsd">
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: SchemaLocation: schemaLocation value = 'http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.0.xsd' must have even number of URI's.
People are reporting problems with this and changing to this fixes it.
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.0.xsd">
As people are taking this out of the reference manual there are quite a few instances of this problem being raised.
