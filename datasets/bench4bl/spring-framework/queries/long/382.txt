When using LocalSessionFactoryBean and DependencyInjectionInterceptorFactoryBean a circular dependency exists as DependencyInjectionInterceptorFactoryBean needs the session factory bean and the LocalSessionFactoryBean needs the interceptor bean.
Also DependencyInjectionInterceptorFactoryBean lacks a method for providing a chained interceptor even though DependencyInjectionInterceptor does support this.
