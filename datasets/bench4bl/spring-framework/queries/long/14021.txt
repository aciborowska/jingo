If I have Spring MVC interface with methods, whose params are annotated with different param types like this:






public interface PersonAPIEndpoint {




  @RequestMapping(




      path = "/person/{username}/",




      method = RequestMethod.GET




  )




  DeferredResult<PersonWithOrganizationalUnitsDTO> loadUserByUsername(@PathVariable("username") String username);




 




  @RequestMapping(




      path = "/person",




      method = RequestMethod.GET




  )




  DeferredResult<DataPage<PersonDTO>> listPersons(@RequestParam("pageNum") int pageNum, @RequestParam("pageSize") int pageSize, @RequestParam(value = "query", required = false) String query);







and class, which is derived from this interface, but arguments of methods are not annotated with Param annotations mapper behaviour is inconsistent:
values, annotated with @RequestParam get their values in implementing class, and with @PathVariable — not.
