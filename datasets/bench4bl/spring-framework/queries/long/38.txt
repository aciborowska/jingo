A CustomPropertyEditor registered with BeanWrapperImpl is not invoked in doTypeConversionIfNecessary(...) if newValue is converted from a String array.
In RC1 an 'else' in line 692 was added preventing (correctly) the invocation of the 'if (newValue instanceof String)'. Unfortunately the check for a custom PropertyEditor is skipped, too.
