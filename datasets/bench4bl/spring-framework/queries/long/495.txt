When using CookieLocaleResolver with a Application running on Tomcat 5.5.4 the saved cookie is false. 
The right format should be: 
de_DE or en_US  
but in Tomcat 5.5.4 the cookie will be saved like this: 
"de_DE_" or "en_US_"    
the quotation mark and the last blank are false.    
I have this Problem with my own application and with the countries sample only on Tomcat 5.5.4 (other 5.5 versions was not tested).
