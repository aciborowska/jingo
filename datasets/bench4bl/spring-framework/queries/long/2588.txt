If log4j debugging is turned on (org.springframework=DEBUG), the container cannot load an aspect bean without getting an NPE in TransactionAttributeSourceAdvisor for the current Trails project.
The regression on this should be easy if you want to sample a project with it.  Just download Trails from trailsframework.org, generate an app from archetype and turn on log4j.logging.  
If you just want to look at the spring configuration, you can do that at http://fisheye.codehaus.org/browse/trails/trunk/trails/trails-archetype/src/main/resources/archetype-resources/src/main/resources/applicationContext.xml?r=329
