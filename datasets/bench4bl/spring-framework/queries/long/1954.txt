JPAInterceptor in 2.0 M4 does not bind EntityManager to thread,
But it tries to unbind it after method invocation in finally block.
I guess,
"TransactionSynchronizationManager.bindResource(getEntityManagerFactory(), new EntityManagerHolder(em));"
got accidentally deleted when you refactored JPA support for EJB3 final draft.
