I'm implemented my own namespase handler for decorating beans definition wia additional Meta attributes, whith are used in custom BeanFactoryPostprocessor for implementing custom logic. I'm declared custom attribue in the nameshema. When i use this attribue in top-level bean definition like 
<bean class="SomeClass" myns:custom-attrbute="customValue"/> 
all perfomed fine, and my handler invoked. But when i'm trying to use my custom attribute in inner bean definition, like 
<bean class="SomeClass"> 
  <property name="someProperty">
     <bean class="PropertyType" myns:custom-attrbute="customValue"/>
  </property>
</bean>
my hadler is not invoking. I'm fixed this by refactored inner beans to toplevel beans and reffering it in property definition, but i think that inner beans definitions should been decorated to.
