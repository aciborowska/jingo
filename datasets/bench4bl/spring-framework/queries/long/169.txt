There is a circular dependency check in PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer that is incorrect.
Given 
1) a bean:
public class PropertyBugBean {
    public PropertyBugBean() {
    }
    public void setJewels(String jewels) 
{
        this.jewels = jewels;
    }

    public String getJewels() 
{
        
        return jewels;
    }

    private String jewels;
}
2) am XML configuration
<beans>
<bean name		= 'firstBean'
     class		= 'PropertyBugBean'>
<property name='jewels'><value>$
{jewel} ${jewel}
</value></property>
</bean>
</beans>
3) and a Property binding: jewel=bling
I expect to see the jewels property for firstBean to be "bling bling". However, PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer tells me it is a circular reference which is clearly not the case - the second instance of $
{jewel}
 is not PRODUCED by the replacement of the first instance. I expect BOTH instances to be correctly replaced.
Don't ask me why I need such a monster substitution in the first place - that's a long convoluted story 
By the way - great product - love it more and more every day!
