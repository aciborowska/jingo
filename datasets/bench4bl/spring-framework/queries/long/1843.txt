HB3 has unchecked exceptions unlike HB2 and HibernateInterceptor will intercept and convert them (since it's possible). However, the javadocs are still the ones from HB2 :

Unfortunately, this interceptor cannot convert checked HibernateExceptions to unchecked dao ones automatically. The intercepted method would have to throw HibernateException to be able to achieve this - thus the caller would still have to catch or rethrow it, even if it will never be thrown if intercepted.
