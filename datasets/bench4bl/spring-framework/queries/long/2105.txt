After settion scope="session" to the bean it doesn't stored in session (ok, it cannot be updated in session). It is because there an error in org.springframework.web.context.scope::updateAccessedAttributes method.
It contains lines like:
for (Iterator it = this.sessionAttributesToUpdate.keySet().iterator(); it.hasNext() {
  Map.Entry entry = (Map.Entry) it.next();
  ...
but as I know java.util.Map::keySet returns strings, but not entries, map entries returned my java.util.Map::entrySet
So, probably these lines should be changed to
for (Iterator it = this.sessionAttributesToUpdate.entrySet().iterator(); it.hasNext() {
  Map.Entry entry = (Map.Entry) it.next();
