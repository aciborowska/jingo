When you register an Objectname with websphere if it is not a complete object name (specifying the cell, node, etc) then websphere will automatically append that information when it registers the mbean.
This is fine, however, websphere from that point forward does not recognize the partial name so attempts to remove the mbean with the partial name will fail.
To fix this problem MBeanRegistrationSupport.doRegister() needs to use the ObjectName from the ObjectInstance  returned from registerMBean instead of the objectName passed into doRegister().
If you have trouble following what I'm saying I can submit a patch.
