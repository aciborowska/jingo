Why should RdbmsOperation log SQL issues as it's subclasses? I have hundreds (literally) of SQL operations in my project, and they always spit out "SQL Statement [...] compiled" during the system startup.
Since the operations are distributed among many modules, packages and (inner) classes, turning off SQL logging is way too cumbersome. IMHO, RdbmsOperation should log SQL statements in it's own categary, not in it's subclasses category.
This is arguable, I know – one can say "oh, but what if I can see the log for one statement and not for the other?", but my experience tells that you usually want SQL logging for all your application, or don't want SQL logging at all – this would be way easier to do if all logging was on a single category.
ALTERNATIVE: leave RdbmsOperation as it is today (i.e., logging on it's subclasses categories), but at least log SQL statements as DEBUG, not INFO.
