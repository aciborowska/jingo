Currenlty the AOP namespace handlers check if a bean definition named org.springframework.aop.config.internalAutoProxyCreator is present and base their decision on the outcome of this check to register a new AutoProxyCreator or not.
If users have already configured an AutoProxyCreator "manually" there will be 2 registered which is not what we want. The check could be more fool-proof by checking for the presence of a bean definition where the class is type-compatible with AbstractAutoProxyCreator. 
One option is to upgrade the class of the bean definition added by the user to the required AutoProxyCreator type.
Another option is to throw an exception and ask the user to remove his or his bean definition.
