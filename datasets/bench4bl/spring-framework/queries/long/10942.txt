The special treatment of lt/eq/ne/etc as alternatives to </==/!= causes problems for elements of SpEL expecting identifiers. The T() reference is one case of that:

T(lt.aaa.bbb.ccc).someMethod()
I think that syntax should be allowed and the lt can be interpreted as either a shorthand for the operator or as a id where an id is being expected.  Should investigate other language components impacted by this and try to address them all.
