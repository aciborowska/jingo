When using the Spring request mapping annotation (org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping), the value attribute does not map an encoded URI correctly. Some encoded reserved characters are excluded.
For example, the slash character /, encoded as %2f, is excluded.
Results as follows.
List of strings which contain reserved characters:






List<String> paths = Arrays.asList(




    "foo%boo"




    ,"foo/boo"




    ,"foo?boo"




    ,"foo=boo"




    ,"foo&boo"




    ,"foo#boo"




    ,"foo$boo"




    ,"foo+boo"




    ,"foo,boo"




    ,"foo:boo"




    ,"foo;boo"




    ,"foo@boo"




);






Controller action to receive requests:






@RequestMapping(value = "/encoded/{value}", method = RequestMethod.GET)




public @ResponseBody String encoded_show() {




    return "encoded_show";




}






Results in the URIs & responses (when requested):






path: "foo%boo"




uri: "/encoded/foo%25boo"




controller_action: "encoded_show"




 




path: "foo/boo"




uri: "/encoded/foo%2Fboo"




controller_action: (404 Not Found)




 




path: "foo?boo"




uri: "/encoded/foo%3Fboo"




controller_action: "encoded_show"




 




path: "foo=boo"




uri: "/encoded/foo%3Dboo"




controller_action: "encoded_show"




 




path: "foo&boo"




uri: "/encoded/foo%26boo"




controller_action: "encoded_show"




 




path: "foo#boo"




uri: "/encoded/foo%23boo"




controller_action: "encoded_show"




 




path: "foo$boo"




uri: "/encoded/foo%24boo"




controller_action: "encoded_show"




 




path: "foo+boo"




uri: "/encoded/foo%2Bboo"




controller_action: "encoded_show"




 




path: "foo,boo"




uri: "/encoded/foo%2Cboo"




controller_action: "encoded_show"




 




path: "foo:boo"




uri: "/encoded/foo%3Aboo"




controller_action: "encoded_show"




 




path: "foo;boo"




uri: "/encoded/foo%3Bboo"




controller_action: "encoded_show"




 




path: "foo@boo"




uri: "/encoded/foo%40boo"




controller_action: "encoded_show"






In order to catch the request for foo/boo (encoded as foo%2Fboo), an additional controller action must be used with wildcard instead of path parameter:






@RequestMapping(value = "/encoded/**", method = RequestMethod.GET)




public @ResponseBody String encoded_any() {




    return "encoded_any";




}






Any ideas?
Thanks.
