the queryForObject(String,Class) method on the JdbcTemplate should throw an IncorrectResultSetSizeDataAccessException when more than one row is returned. It doesn't at the moment.
I've added a failing test suit to the JdbcTemplateTests (you'll notice it) with the corresponding bug number as method name.
Fix should be easy; adding DataAccessUtils.requireUniqueResult should be enough. Haven't done this though, as this needs backporting to the 1.2 branch.
