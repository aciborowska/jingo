This is sandbox code I believe...

Hi,
I've just freshed my local Spring source and find that JSF-Spring won't compile. The problems are in the FacesSpringVariableResolver:
1. the transformedBeanName method of the super class has been turned to private, thus not accessible the the subclass.
2. isFactoryDereference has seemed to be factored out to the BeanFactoryUtils. (This is trivial to fix though)
I'm wondering if the future version of the AbstractBeanFactory.transformedBeanName can still keep its protected signature.
Any ideas?
Thanks!

to follow up,
I also had to modify the getPropertyValue method in the FacesConfigXmlBeanDefinitionParser class in the JSF-Spring package to make them work together:
Here is the change I needed to make:
from:
return new RuntimeBeanReference(value);
to:
return new RuntimeBeanReference(value.substring(2, value.indexOf("}")));
