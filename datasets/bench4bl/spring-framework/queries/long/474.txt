I am playing with the AOP stuff and it's really powerful.
I was using the AfterReturningAdvisor to do the trivial logging of what method a given user has performed for a kind of audit log.
There is no javadoc for the method itself on the interface and I am a bit confused what would happend if I thron an exception.
See the javadoc for MethodBeforeAdvice it has full javadoc.
Will the same thing happend if an exception is thrown?
Throwable - if this object wishes to abort the call. Any exception thrown will be returned to the caller if it's allowed by the method signature. Otherwise the exception will be wrapped as a runtime exception.
Hope it's easy to fix for Rod
