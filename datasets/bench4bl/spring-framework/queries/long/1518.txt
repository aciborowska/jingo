An IllegalAccessException can be thrown by BeanWrapperImpl when accessing a public method defined in a private class (that implements a public interface). The bug does not occur each time, however, but seems to occur after some garbage collection has been performed.
I'm attaching a test case and associated class that illustrates the problem.
