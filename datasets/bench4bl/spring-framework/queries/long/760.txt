I'm using ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource for application messages. It is required to be able to refresh them at runtime (hot reload), so I'm using a JMX invoke on clearCacheIncludingAncestors. This method runs fine ONLY if cacheSeconds is not set to -1 (disabled).
Not beeing a problem, I set it to 36000 and run my app. Now, refreshProperties fails because one of my property files is in a jar in WEB-INF/lib (not readable form filesystem).
auto-refresh should not fail if resource.getFile() throws IOException. In current version it return an empty PropertiesHolder (line 455). It may try to load the properties (separate cacheMillis check try/catch from properties loading try/catch).
It may also be possible to programmatically refresh messageSource with autorefresh disabled.
