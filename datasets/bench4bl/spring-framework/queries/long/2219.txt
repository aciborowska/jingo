HandlerInterceptor.afterActionCompletion and HandlerInterceptor.afterRenderCompletion have identical documentation.  I assume the two different methods have slightly different purposes 
Same thing for preHandleRender and preHandleAction
It would also help if a complete listing of what is executed when was listed.  Right now it's pretty confusing.  For example:

DispatcherServlet maps request to particular handler
HandlerInterceptor.preHandleAction is invoked
Controller is invoked, assuming preHandleAction returns true
HandlerInterceptor.afterActionCompletion is invoked

etc
