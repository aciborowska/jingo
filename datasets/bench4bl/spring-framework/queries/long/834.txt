The LocalSessionFactory bean currently has no way to set listeners on the SessionFactory (via the Configuration.setListener) method.  This should as simple as accepting a map as a property of the LocalSessionFactoryBean, and when building the Configuration object, iterating through it, and calling Configuration.setListener on each iteration.
