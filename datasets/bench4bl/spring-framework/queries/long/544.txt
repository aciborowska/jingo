I'm running quartz in a clustered environment. When shutting down tomcat, I am seeing ThreadDeath errors. It looks like these 2 threads are never shut down:

clusterManagementThread
misfireHandler

I believe I see the cause of the problem:
I'm using LocalDataSourceJobStore, and the shutdown method has been overridden to do nothing. The javadoc comment is "Do not perform the base class' DataSource shutdown here. A Spring-provided DataSource has its own lifecycle." The problem is that this prevents this piece of code in org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.JobStoreSupport:
    public void shutdown() {
        if (clusterManagementThread != null)
                clusterManagementThread.shutdown();
        if (misfireHandler != null) misfireHandler.shutdown();
