This affects Hibernate2/Hibernate3:
When configuring HibernateTemplate with alwaysUseNewSession=true and in deferredClose mode, newly created Sessions are not closed at the end of the execute() method. Instead, they are registered for deferred close and remain open until the request ends.
Bug is in the SessionFactoryUtils.closeSessionOrRegisterDeferredClose() method of the hibernate and hibernate3 packages.
