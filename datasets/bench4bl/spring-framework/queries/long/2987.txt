In the 1.2.x documentation, there is no indication of deprecation or warning of future modification. See: http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/1.2.x/api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/UrlFilenameViewController.html#getViewNameForUrlPath(java.lang.String)
From the source, the functionality appears to have been moved into the following method:
http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/UrlFilenameViewController.html#getViewNameForRequest(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)
I certainly follow the logic behind the additional level of encapsulation, but I think a fair and more professional approach would be to add back the method in 2.0 marked as deprecated with the suggestion of using getViewNameForRequest instead (in the parent abstract class as well).
