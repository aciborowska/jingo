The second paragraph in the "Spring 2.0 AOP" box on p. 82 of the spring 2.0 reference PDF. The sentence:
    See choosing which AOP declaration style to use for
    advice on choosing the appropriate style for your application.
contains a reference to the title of section 6.4, but that title should be in quotes, and probably prefixed by the word "section". Took me a while to figure out what the sentence was trying to tell me.
