In 2.0M3 and previous releases, onTearDownInTransaction() and onTearDownAfterTransaction() were being invoked regardless of whether endTransaction() was eagerly called from a test method. Since 2.0RC3 neither method is being invoked which is causing failures in my tests as my custom testDown method is not being called. 
Shouldn't onTearDownAfterTransaction() always be invoked by AbstractTransactionalSpringContextTests regardless of the transaction status?
