With Hibernate EntityManager, the method org.springframework.orm.jpa.PersistenceUnitReader.validateResource (Line 281) raises an FileNotFoundException for the file persistence_1_0.dtd. The reason is, that this file is located in the package org.hibernate.ejb in the library hibernate-entitymanager.jar.
With TopLink their is no problem, because their the file is located in the root of library toplink-essentials.jar
