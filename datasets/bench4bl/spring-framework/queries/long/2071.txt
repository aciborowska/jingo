The ParameterMappingInterceptor in PortletMVC takes a ParameterHandlerMapping as a bean property and gets the name of the parameter to propagate from that handler mapping.  There are now two different handlers that both benfit from the use of the ParameterMappingInterceptor, so this approach does not work well (it is also somewhat confusing).  We should modify ParameterMappingInterceptor to take the name of the parameter to propagate directly as a bean property so that it can be used with any handler mapping.  This only matters when the default parameter name of 'action' needs to be overridden.
