Indicates that ManagedProperties class is inherited from jdk 1.5 class hierarchy.
It is used in DefaultXmlBeanDefinitionParser.
This is preventing my upgrade to m2. m1 works fine and does not have offending class.
At runtime n JDK 1.4  I get following error:
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.springframework.beans.factory.s
upport.ManagedProperties:  This error could indicate that a component was deploy
ed on a  cluster member but not other members of that cluster. Make sure that an
y component deployed on a server that is part of a cluster is also deployed on a
ll other members of that cluster
