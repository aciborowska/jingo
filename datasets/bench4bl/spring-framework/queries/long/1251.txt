When configuring auto proxying with optimize set to true advice is not executed. If the opmptize property is set to false and JDK proxies are used then advice is executed. 
I have debuged the application and confirmed that the cglib proxies are being created for the class and in fact are being accessed at runtime for the methods defined in the pointcut. However, the advice is not executed, specifically the invoke method is not called on the MethodInterceptor.
Attached is the spring config with the aop configuration and the MethodInterceptor implementation in question.
