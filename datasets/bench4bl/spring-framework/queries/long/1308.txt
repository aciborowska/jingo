There is a bug in AbstractPdfView class. There is no possibility to register onOpenDocument event (PdfPageEvent method) on a writer (PdfWriter). Can't do this in buildPdfMetadata, because I don't have a writer. Can do this in buildPdfDocument, because document is already opened and my event will not trigger.
