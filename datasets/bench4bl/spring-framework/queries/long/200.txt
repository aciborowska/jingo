autowire="constructor" causes Spring to go looking for beans by type to fill in the constructor arguments. This ends up calling DefaultListableBeanFactory.getBeansOfType with includeFactoryBeans=true. This will in turn call getBean(FACTORY_BEAN_PREFIX + factoryNames[i]) on all FactoryBean's.
But this getBean call will find itself if the bean being autowired is a FactoryBean. And so we end up in an infinite loop.
