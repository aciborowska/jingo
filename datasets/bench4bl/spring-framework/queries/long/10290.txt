In 3.2.0 a Spring-MVC project did not require to additionally include the spring-web dependency (because it was already a compile-time dependency of spring-webmvc).
In 3.2.1 it is now a provided dependency.
This breaks pretty much every annotated controller (which uses e.g. @RequestMapping,@RequestHeader,@RequestParam...) with:






... package org.springframework.web.bind.annotation does not exist




... package org.springframework.http does not exist




... cannot find symbol






The workaround is of course trivial, just to include spring-web as additional dependency of the according project:






<dependency>




<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>




   <artifactId>spring-web</artifactId>




    <version>${org.springframework-version}</version>




</dependency>






Was there a reason for the change?
Then perhaps this should be documented in the changelog and/or migration section of the springframework reference document?
