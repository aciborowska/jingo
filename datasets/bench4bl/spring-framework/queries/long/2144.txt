The <form:checkbox > tag is not working correctly with Booleans (as opposed to booleans).  Per the documentation, the "value" attribute is not needed when a Boolean is bound to the field.  Right now we get an error that states that "value is required if type is not java.lang.Boolean" - but it is!
If we change the getters/setters to use type "boolean" everything works ok. 
In M4 we used a value="true" attribute and the tag worked, picking up the proper value from the form backing object and saving it, too.  Using that same approach in M5 we always get the checkbox checked on initial display, as if it ignored the value in the form backing object.  However, if you then uncheck it, the binding works right on form submission.
