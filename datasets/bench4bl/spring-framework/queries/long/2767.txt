If I have two request scoped beans who reference each other when I attempt to load one of those beans I get an OutOfMemoryException because of an infinite loop.
Example:
<bean name="someBean" scope="request">
    <property name="someOtherBean" ref="someOtherBean"/>
</bean> 
<bean name="someOtherBean" scope="request">
    <property name="someBean" ref="someBean"/>
</bean> 
Even if circular references of non singleton scoped beans is not supported we should probably not have an infinite loop if it's possible to avoid.
