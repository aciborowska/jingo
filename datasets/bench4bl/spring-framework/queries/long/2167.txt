Spring does not correctly delegate lookups for schema and handler resources to the ApplicationContext classloader if set. Futhermore the handling is different between DefaultNamespaceHandlerResolver & PluggableSchemaResolver in XmlBeanDefinitionReader.
I will attach a patch that fixes the issue for me.
