There seems to be an error in the example given in section 13.11.1 of the reference docs:
~~ Quote ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the case of MultiActionController handler classes, the mappings generated are (ever so slightly) more complex, but hopefully no less understandeable. Some examples (all of the Controller  names in this next bit are assumed to be MultiActionController  implementations).

AdminController maps to the '/welcome/*' request URL
CatalogController maps to the '/catalog/*' request URL

~~ End Quote ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Surely AdminController would map to the '/admin/*' request URL?
