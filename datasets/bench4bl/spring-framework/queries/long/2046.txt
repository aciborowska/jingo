Enabling statement caching with Oracle 10g JDBC drivers may result in difficult to track exceptions (ORA-17041).
I was not able to investigate the problem fully, but after a full sunday afternoon of debugging, I am able to attach a JUnit repeatable test case.
The test case is artificially simple, I experienced the bug in a much more complex situation in a production web application.
I used Oracle JDBC thin driver version 10.2 (10.2.0.4 I think).
