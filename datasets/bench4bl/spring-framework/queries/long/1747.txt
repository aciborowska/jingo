The <spring-form:form> tag does not allow an empty value for the action attribute.  Declaring an empty action attribute is a common trick to default to the URI that the page originally came from.  It nicely keeps coupling a bit lower as you don't need to specify the URI that the form will submit to.
Please allow this to be legal: <spring-form:form action="" />
Thanks!
