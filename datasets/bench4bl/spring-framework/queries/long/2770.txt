The example code in the Lookup method injection section (3.3.8.1) doesn't compile.  There are duplicate local variables, the abstract method returns the wrong type, its got the wrong method name and the class isn't abstract.  I think the code should look something like below.
public abstract class CommandManager
{
	public Object process ( Object commandState )
	{
		// grab a new instance of the appropriate Command interface
		Command command = createCommand ();
		// set the state on the (hopefully brand new) Command instance
		command.setState ( commandState );
		return command.execute ();
	}

	// mmm, but where is the implementation of this method?
	protected abstract Command createCommand ();
}
public interface Command
{
	public void setState ( Object commandState );
	public boolean execute ();
}
public class AsyncCommand implements Command
{
	private Object commandState;
	public AsyncCommand ()
	{
		System.out.println ( "Created AsyncCommand" );
	}

	public void setState ( Object commandState )
	{
		this.commandState = commandState;
	}

	public boolean execute ()
	{
		System.out.println ( commandState );
		return true;
	}
}
