If you create two different SimpleMappingExceptionResolvers for different handlers, the first resolver's defaultView will be returned regardless of the handlers actually mapped to it.
Context where this gives unexpected behaviour:
one ExceptionResolver for handlers delivering frame content (shows an error view inside a frame)
one ExceptionResolver for handlers delivering content with no frames
