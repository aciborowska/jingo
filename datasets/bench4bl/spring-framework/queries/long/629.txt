Email attachments not working in Lotus Notes.
Using the org.springframework.mail.javamail.MimeMessageHelper to create an email with a text part and a file attachment results in the file attachment not being visible when viewing the email in Lotus Notes. The attachments seem correctly viewable in other mail client programs, e.g. browser mail clients.
The problem seems  to be related to how the text part of the email is added to the mail message.
If you use the code below, the attachment (added later) does not appear when the email is viewed.
// where msg is a MimeMessageHelper
msg.setText(someText, true);
If you do the following workaround, the email message received does not have the paperclip symbol but does have an attachment icon within the email message when you open the email.
// where msg is a MimeMessageHelper
MimeBodyPart mbp = new MimeBodyPart();
mbp.setText(someText);
msg.getMimeMultipart().addBodyPart(mbp);
We're using the following MimeMessageHelper method to add the attachment.
msg.addAttachment(someFileName, dataSource);
I found the following which may be some help with this.

I am also happy to try out any possible fixes if you don't have access to Lotus Notes (lucky you).
Cheers,
