Hello,
I know this may seem trivial, but going from RC3 to RC4, there has been a change in log messages being printed out. Specifically org.springframework.jms.connection.SingleConnectio nFactory.createConnection() has the following code:
public Connection createConnection() throws JMSException {
synchronized (this.connectionMonitor) {
if (this.connection == null) {
initConnection();
}
if (logger.isInfoEnabled()) {
logger.info("Established shared JMS Connection: " + this.target);
}
return this.connection;
}
}
This logger.info() statement is being printed out to the logfiles less than once a second. Can this log statement be changed to a DEBUG level instead of an INFO level? Having a log message print out at this kind of frequency renders the log file as useless. I think DEBUG would be more appropriate.
I checked in RC3 and the debug statement in the same createConnection() method was at DEBUG level.
Thanks,
Jim
