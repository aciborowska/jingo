Some of the Spring form tags are using the method isAssignableFrom in the TagUtils class to determine if they are being used in the proper context. The problem is that this method is checking for exact equality of classes when looking at the ancestors, which prevents the form tags from easily being subclassed. For example, if I subclass org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.form.SelectTag I can no longer use the spring option tag because they only work under the spring option tag.
Please change line 95 from:
if (parentTagClass.equals(ancestor.getClass())) {
to be:
if (parentTagClass.isAssignableFrom(ancestor.getClass())) {
