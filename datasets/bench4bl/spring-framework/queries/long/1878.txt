Could you please reverse method signature for MutablePropertyValues MutablePropertyValues.addPropertyValue(String, Object) to void MutablePropertyValues.addPropertyValue(String, Object) as was before 1.2.7.
This issue is same as in SPR-1677, but now (hopefully) for 1.2.8. Since this change is done for 2.0 M3 I see no reason for not to do it in 1.2.8. I'm also having an incompatibility with XBean 
Thanks,
