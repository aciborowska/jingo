Great work on adding the form simplication taglibs to the core distro!  Spring has finally caught up to Struts in the year 2000. 
The <form> tag declaration in the TLD is missing the 'method' attribute.  The tag class itself, however, already includes the appropriate code.
Thanks again!  I need to create an errata for the book now.
