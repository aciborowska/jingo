The Log4jConfigListener together with the WebUtils set the system property "WebappRoot". WebUtils has a safe guard that if the property is already defined for the same key then an exception is thrown.
Now my problem is that I cannot redeploy a new version of an application in Websphere with a different name. The old version is removed but the system property still stays around (until you shut down the server). So now I install the new version of the application (same webrootkey) and use a different name. Websphere unpacks the application under this new name and the startup will fail.
Hope this is clear. I recommend that on shutdown of Spring (Log4JConfig Servlet) the system property for the webapproot is removed.
