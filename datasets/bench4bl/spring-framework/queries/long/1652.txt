My render method is returning a resolved View object in the model and view returned to the dispatcher portlet. 
However I always get the message 'Could not resolve view with name ...'. 
The problem seems to be that the code in the render method does not set the local variable 'view' to the view object returned from the mv.getView() call in the code block executed when the ModelAndView is not a reference value.
I added the line 'view = (View)viewObject;' at the end of the code block and all seems ok.
