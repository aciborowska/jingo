If you override the default EventMulticaster by specifing a bean with an id of "applicationEventMulticaster" in a parent context, but do not do the override in a child contexts, events published on the child context are delivered twice to parent registered listeners. 
This seems to be a defect as it does not deliver the events twice if you do not do the override in the parent context.
