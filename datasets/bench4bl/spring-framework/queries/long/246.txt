There is a bug in BindError.getFieldValue(String field) which causes it to operate incorrectly if (a) nestedPath is anything other than the empty string and (b) there is a field error.
The method starts with:
	public Object getFieldValue(String field) {
		field = fixedField(field);
		FieldError fe = getFieldError(field);
But getFieldError() itself also adds the nestedPath prefix:
	public FieldError getFieldError(String field) {
		field = fixedField(field);
So when there is a nested path, field errors will be ignored (or in obscure cases, the wrong field error may be found). The simplest fix would be to swap the first two lines in getFieldValue.
I must say that this illustrates why the practice of modifying parameter values is frowned upon in some circles
