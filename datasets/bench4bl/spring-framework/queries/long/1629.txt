AbstractResource's exist() has trouble closing an InputStream on a JarURLConnection:
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at java.io.FilterInputStream.close(FilterInputStream.java:159)
	at sun.net.www.protocol.jar.JarURLConnection$JarURLInputStream.close(JarURLConnection.java:88)
	at org.springframework.core.io.AbstractResource.exists(AbstractResource.java:52)
As a fix I'd suggest handling NPE's the same way as the throwing of another IOException.
