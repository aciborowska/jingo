An injected TaskExecutor will be ignored if other properties are not set due to the following condition in line 586:
if (this.configLocation != null || this.quartzProperties != null ||
				this.dataSource != null || this.schedulerName != null)
If none of these properties are set, the TaskExecutor ends up being ignored... this condition needs to include:


 this.taskExecutor != null
