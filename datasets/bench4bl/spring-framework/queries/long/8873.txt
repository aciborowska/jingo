I want to have a cache class which clears itself. Since the both annotations are not working together I have to create a special task class.
The problem is that the cache class is a proxy and then the scheduler runs into a ClassCastException.
Perhaps it is no real bug. For me it is. 
It is also possible that is already a known issue without any possible solution.
Desired syntax would be something like that:
 @Scheduled(fixedDelay=50000) 
 @CacheEvict(value = "country", allEntries=true)
  public void clearCache() 
{
        //only clear cache;
  }
