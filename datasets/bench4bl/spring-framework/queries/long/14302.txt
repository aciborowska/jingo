My app is hosted on multiple servers, each with its own broker. A user can have more than one open session, where each of those sessions are sticky but may be on different servers in the cluster. Clients are connected to the broker via Spring Websocket.
The problem I'm seeing is when a message is sent to a distributed topic user destination.
Expected:
The message would be relayed to all the brokers in the cluster, so that all of the sessions open for that user (regardless of the app server hosting the session) would receive the message.
Observed:
If there are any sessions for the user open on the app server that's executing the send, the message will only be delivered to to those sessions and will not be relayed to the other brokers in the cluster.
