In the org.springframework.core.io.support.PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver class method 'protected List doFindPathMatchingJarResources(Resource rootDirResource, String subPattern) throws IOException' on line 292 is the following line of code located.
{
  String rootEntryPath = jarCon.getJarEntry().getName();
}
On my system and environment it returns a rootEntryPath with a '/' suffix as when I run (debug) it on the same machine but use the SUN jdk 1.4.2_06 it returns a rootEntryPath without the '/' suffix. Maybe this is a bug of JRockit but I hope you can solve it inside the springframework.
If the rootEntryPath is returned with a '/' suffix the next check { PathMatcher.match(subPattern, entryPath.substring(rootEntryPath.length())))
} never returns true and the resource will never be added.
I just started to use you're framework cause I heard promising stories and when I look at it, it fullfills and exceeds my expectations I hope you can find a solutions for this bug or maybe it isn't a bug anymore anyway please let my know about any possible solutions. Otherwise I will have to switch back to the SUN jvm.
kind regard's Cees van Wieringen.
keep up the promising work.
