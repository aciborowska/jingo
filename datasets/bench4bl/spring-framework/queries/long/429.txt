Section 3.6, para 2, 1st - 4th bullet: 
"beandefinition" is used inconsistently from prior uses.
Since one is referring to  
  org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanDefinition
the prior usage, BeanDefinition (section 3.2 ff.), 
should be maintained here and throughout.  
Otherwise, it just looks like a run-on and does
not give the reader a ready indication that
an object in the framework is being referred to. 
Example of inconsistent usage (bullet 4):
Reads: "If the beandefinition corresponding to the given name ..."
For consistency with early usage, it
probably should read: 
"If the BeanDefinition corresponding to the given name ...."
