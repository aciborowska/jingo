In 1.2.7, part of the class JavaDoc for org.springframework.beans.PropertyEditorRegistrar reads:
----------

<p>Serves as super-interface for the BeanWrapper interface.
Implemented by BeanWrapperImpl and also by the DataBinder class
in the validation package.
----------

This text applies to the PropertyEditorRegistry interface, not the PropertyEditorRegistrar.
In fact, as of 1.2.7, there are no implementations or subinterfaces of PropertyEditorRegistrar shipped with the distribution.
