Please se attached class ApplicationContextReaderImpl.java .
Testcase:
We tried to get this class @Autowired into a consumer of the class (The consumer declares @Autowired on the interface).
Observations:
1) If used as is - Spring finds no match (expecting 1 unique bean - finds none).
2) If it's not defined in the spring context as a @Component but defined in xml - it will be found!
3) If the inner Cache class is defined as a static class - autowiring ( 1) ) will succeed.
So this clearly has to be an autowiring bug.
