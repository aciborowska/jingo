I am trying to expose spring beans using JMX. I am using the JmxBeanAdapter and the "beans" property to add individual beans to the map. Adding a single bean works fine but as soon as I add more than one, I start getting exceptions when browsing the JMX beans using a JMX browser. I believe that the issue is related to comment #2 here: http://opensource.atlassian.com/confluence/spring/display/DOC/Exposing+your+Beans
I have a work around this by adding one bean per adapter but I think this is not the desired behaviour.
