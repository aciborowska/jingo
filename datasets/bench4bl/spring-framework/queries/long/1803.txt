I'm tring to proxy a class, and want the proxy in its own classloader (so I can drop the class). I have tried:
aProxyFactory.getProxy(myClassLoader);
The call goes through to Cglib2AopProxy#getProxy(myClassLoader)  but there the classloader argument is not used at all. I'm guessing it should be passed to Enhancer#setClassLoader(ClassLoader). Or am I missing something?
