This RequestMapping doesn't work:






@RequestMapping(value = "/administration/user/{id}/account/{accountId}/transfer/{accounttransferId}", method = RequestMethod.GET)






This RequestMapping works:






@RequestMapping(value = "/administration/account/{accountId}/transfer/{accounttransferId}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
