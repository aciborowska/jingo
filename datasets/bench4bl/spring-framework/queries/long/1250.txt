When utilizing auto proxy creation through a descendent of AbstractAutoproxyCreator setting the frozen flag to true prevents the addition of advice to any of the created proxies making it impossible to use this optimization when auto proxying.
This problem is caused in the AbstractAutoProxyCreator.createProxy method when the following steps occur :
....
ProxyFactory proxyFactory = new ProxyFactory();
// Copy our properties (proxyTargetClass) inherited from ProxyConfig.
proxyFactory.copyFrom(this);
during the copy operation the frozen attribute from the auto proxy creator is copied to the proxy factory. When the frozen attribute is set to true then the proxyFactory is frozen before any advice has been added. 
To fix this I have made the following minor change :
ProxyFactory proxyFactory = new ProxyFactory();
// Copy our properties (proxyTargetClass) inherited from ProxyConfig.
proxyFactory.copyFrom(this);
//Change : Frozen attribute copied which we don't want until after advice is added
proxyFactory.setFrozen(false);
... proceed to add advice 
//Change :  Now that adivce is configured we can copy the frozen attribute before creating the proxy.
proxyFactory.setFrozen(this.isFrozen());
return proxyFactory.getProxy();
This solves the problem.
