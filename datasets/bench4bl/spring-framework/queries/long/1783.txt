There seems to be no way to filter which advisors to attempt to match for configuring proxies.  AspectJAutoProxyCreator seems to implement it's own findCandidateAdvisors that creates advisors for all @Aspect annotated beans it finds without checking for usePrefix flag or filtering on advisorBeanNamePrefix. 
This causes problems when trying AspectJ autoproxying in combination with compile or load-time weaving since things like AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect are candidates for autoproxying.
