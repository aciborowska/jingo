I have a property named arrays of type List<String[]> 
public void setArrays( List<String[]> arrays )
I try to set it like this:
<property name="arrays">
	<list value-type="java.lang.String[]">
		<list>
			<value>value1</value>
			<value>value1</value>
		</list>
	</list>
</property>
But at runtime I get a List that contains a List, not a List that contains a String array. I added the value-type="java.lang.String[]" attribute, but it didn't change anything.
I would expect this work since I can set a property of type String[]
public void setArray( String[] array )
like this:
<property name="array">
	<list>
		<value>value1</value>
		<value>value1</value>
	</list>
</property>
This is similar to (or even a duplicate of?) SPR-2509 and SPR-2807.
