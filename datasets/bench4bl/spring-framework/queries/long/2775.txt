The assertion in ErrorsTag.java:  onWriteTagContent() is assuming that the form:form tag is in the same document as the one being processed.  This effectively disallows JSP nesting and reuse when it is necessary to have the form:form tag outside the nested page.
I'm not sure if this really IS a bug.  I know it is a safety mechanism but the case can also be made it gets in the way.
