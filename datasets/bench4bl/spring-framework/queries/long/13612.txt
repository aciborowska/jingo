The fix to protect against RFD exploits (SPR-13548) introduced a "Content-Disposition:attachment;filename=f.txt" response header for @ResponseBody methods where the URL appears to have an extension that is neither whitelisted by default nor explicitly registered by the application.
However if you name an application with Maven conventions my-app.1.3.4-SNAPSHOT and deploy to a servlet container a Content-Disposition header is added for the URLs that match the context and/or servlet path.
