The spring test infrastructure no longer honour prototype-scoped beans if they are injected wiht @Resource. It does work with @Autowired.
We suspect that SPR-9176 may have brought this regression.
To reproduce, extract the zip and run the tests (either from your IDE or on the command line with Maven). You can validate the regression by running the following command:






mvn clean install -Dspring.version=3.1.1.RELEASE
