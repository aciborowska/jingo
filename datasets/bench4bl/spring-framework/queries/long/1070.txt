It is possible to return a null Logger from a CommonsLogFactoryBean instance if you use the following XML configuration...
<bean id="loggingfactorybean" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.CommonsLogFactoryBean"/>
In the above snippet, the 'logName' property has NOT been set. The CommonsLogFactoryBean does not however implement the InitializingBean interface, and the value that it returns from it's getObject() implementation is only ever set after a call to the setLogName property... since a value is never being passed to the setLogName property, the Logger is never created.
The fix... have CommonsLogFactoryBean implement the InitializingBean interface and check for the setting of the required 'logName' property in this method. The Logger can be created here too, in preference to it being created in the setLogName property.
