AbstractFormController does not call "showForm" if binding errors occur.  The javadoc documentation of the class clearly states that it will call showForm on binding errors.
SimpleFormController works around this bug by calling showForm from its implementation of processFormSubmission.
Proposed solution: Add a check for binding errors in AbstractFormController.handRequestInternal and remove the call to showForm in SimpleFormController.processFormSubmission.
Alternatively, the javadoc should be modified.
