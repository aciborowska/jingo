From an email I sent to Rob...
<<<<<<<<<<
Rob,
I switched from using the JMX in the Sandbox to the one now going to be used in 1.2RC1.    However, I'm having some issues with it.
I have my bean that I want exposed set up to use CommonsAttributes.
I have the MBeanExporter use the default Naming Strategy.  When I deploy I get a javax.management.MalformedObjectNameException: Missing ':' character in ObjectName exception.
So I tried swapping in the MetadataNamingStrategy which gives me a different error: javax.management.MalformedObjectNameException: Your bean class [javax.management.remote.jmxmp.JMXMPConnectorServer] must be marked with a valid ManagedResource attribute when using MetadataNamingStrategy
This never happened with the JMX that was in the sandbox.  Is there some additional parameter I need to set?
