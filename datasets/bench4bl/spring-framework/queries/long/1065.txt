This is reported against SWF Preview 3, for class RequestParamNameToRequestAttributeFilter.
The filter searches for a name prefix from the beginning of the string.  It then searches for a value prefix from the beginning of the string (instead of the end of the prefix, as it should).  This can cause a problem if the value prefix is also contained within the name prefix (a trivial case of this is when you wish the value prefix to be empty â€“ "").
Here is the trivial fix.  Change:
int pvaluePrefixIndex = nameIn.indexOf(inputValuePrefix);
to:
int pvaluePrefixIndex = nameIn.indexOf(inputValuePrefix, inputNamePrefix.length());
