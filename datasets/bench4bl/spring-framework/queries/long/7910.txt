Hi,
I've been thinking if it is possible to handle Multipart request that is not an Action request. There is a reason why it seems impossible to me :
 
only ActionRequest implements getFile() kind of methods
What if I don't use a html form to upload a file and I don't want a view to be rendered after action request, which happens always after the action phase.
What if I want to create a post request (with file(s)) by ajax and use @ResourceMapping handler. How do I get it out of ResourceRequest ?
Thank you very much for your thoughts.
