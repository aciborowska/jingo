If a bean name contains dots (.), its properties cannot be 
overwritten with PropertyOverrideConfigurer.
This is due to the way how the bean is examined in PropertyOverrideConfigurer.processKey():
 // ....
 int dotIndex = key.indexOf('.');
 // ....
So only the first part of a dotted bean name is used and the rest as the property name which obiously doesn't work.
IMHO the better alternative is to use 'lastIndexOf()' since nested
properties doesn't make sense in this context anyway.
