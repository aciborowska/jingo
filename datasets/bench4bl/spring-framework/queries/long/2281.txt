I have a class that has both the annotations @Transactional and @ManagedResource. The resource is not being registered to JMX. If I comment out the @Transactional annotations then the class is registered to JMX.
My guess is that the class is wrapped by the transactional aspects, and then that wrapped class is passed to the MBeanExporter. The MBeanExporter can no longer see the @ManagedResource annotations.
This is easy to work around, but I have no idea where to start looking for a fix for it. It may require support from CGLib to propogate the annotations from the underlying class to the wrapped class.
