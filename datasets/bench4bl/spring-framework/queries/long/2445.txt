The Javadocs for LazyInitTargetSource in the 1.2.x version at http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/1.2.x/api/index.html are incorrect in that the property
  <property name="targetBeanName" ref="serviceTarget"/>
is set to a reference to the bean, rather than the name of the bean. This error has already been corrected in the 2.x Javadocs where this property reads 
 <property name="targetBeanName"><idref local="serviceTarget"/></property>
