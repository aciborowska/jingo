A bean definition that implements FactoryBean and the ApplicationListener interfaces results in the ClassCastException during initialization.
The ClassCastException is triggered by the AbstractApplicationContext#refreshListeners() where the getBeansOfType(ApplicationListener.class, true, false) is requested.
That query should filter out the FactoryBean beans (third parameter 'false') but the FactoryBean implementations get returned.
This looks it is caused by the code in the 
DefaultListableBeanFactory# getBeansOfType(Class type, boolean includePrototypes, boolean includeFactoryBeans)
where the code below does not check if the FactoryBean instances are excluded.
String[] beanNames = getBeanDefinitionNames(type);
Map result = new HashMap();
for (int i = 0; i < beanNames.length; i++) {
  if (includePrototypes || isSingleton(beanNames[i])) {
    try 
{
	result.put(beanNames[i], getBean(beanNames[i]));
    }
