This follows on from a bug I previously reported in the forums (ClassCastException binding properties):
I'm using SimpleFormController and a JavaBean-style command class which has an int[] defined within it. On my HTML form I have the following, the values of which should be bound to my int[]:
<p><input type="checkbox" name="deleteGroupIndexes" value="0"></p>
<p><input type="checkbox" name="deleteGroupIndexes" value="1"></p>
<p><input type="checkbox" name="deleteGroupIndexes" value="2"></p>
and so on ...
When I submit the form, binding works fine if more than one checkbox is selected, and my int[] contains the correct values. However if only one checkbox is selected, binding fails as it tries to bind it as an int instead of an int[].
I've modified BeanWrapperImpl (taken from CVS today) as shown below and this appears to fix the problem.
