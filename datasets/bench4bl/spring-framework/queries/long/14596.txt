Two themes are used in the project structured like this:
 – themes


– theme1



style.css (wich have url('d.png'))





d.png




– theme2



style.css (wich have url('d.png'))





d.png




When we are in the production (cacheResources is true), we detect that we have only one version of the file "d.png" stored in the cache and both style files refer to the same d.png file.
In the CachingResourceResolver, file are cached with reference (relativePath) witch explain why we get once cached d.png file.
 As you can see bellow :






protected String resolveUrlPathInternal(String resourceUrlPath,




			List<? extends Resource> locations, ResourceResolverChain chain) {




 




		String key = RESOLVED_URL_PATH_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX + resourceUrlPath;




		String resolvedUrlPath = this.cache.get(key, String.class);




 




		if (resolvedUrlPath != null) {




			if (logger.isTraceEnabled()) {




				logger.trace("Found match");




			}




			return resolvedUrlPath;




		}




 




		resolvedUrlPath = chain.resolveUrlPath(resourceUrlPath, locations);




		if (resolvedUrlPath != null) {




			if (logger.isTraceEnabled()) {




				logger.trace("Putting resolved resource URL path in cache");




			}




			this.cache.put(key, resolvedUrlPath);




		}




 




		return resolvedUrlPath;




	}







Our ResourceHandlerRegistry configuration :






        VersionResourceResolver versionResourceResolver = new VersionResourceResolver()




                .addContentVersionStrategy("/**");




        registry.addResourceHandler("/static/**")




                .addResourceLocations("/static/")




                .setCachePeriod(cachePeriod)




                .resourceChain(useCache)




                .addResolver(versionResourceResolver);
