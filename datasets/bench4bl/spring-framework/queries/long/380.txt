I tried using an inner bean definition with a "parent" definition, as in what follows:
<bean id="outer" class="blah.blah">
    <property name="p">
        <bean parent="inherited">
...blahblahblah...
        </bean>
    </property>
</bean>
<bean id="inherited">
...blahblah...
</bean>
but this fails with an error: "Error registering bean with name '' defined in class path resource [applicationContext.xml]: Child bean definition has neither 'id' nor 'name'".
I think this should be allowed, isn't it? Anyway, adding an "id" property to the inner bean seems to be a suitable workaround.
