I'm using MBeanServerConnectionFactoryBean and MBeanProxyFactoryBean to access JMX MBeans from the client (like documented on chapter 20 of the manual)
My problem is that if the server isn't running, it fails with an exception. Is there any way to keep the configuration this way, but generate exceptions in runtime (when I want to call the proxy)
I had this same problem with the RMI exporter, but it had a lazy argument, I don't see one for the JMX setup.
