I have configuration in XML files, @Configuration files and component scanning files. While deploying I am getting NullPointerException. The code works fine with XMLs only.
The stacktrace and code could be found at the Spring Forum reference. I will be glad to attach more if necessary, just let me know.
With all due respect, the JavaConfig part of the reference manual could be better. It illustrates only simple examples and there are no sample applications available.
