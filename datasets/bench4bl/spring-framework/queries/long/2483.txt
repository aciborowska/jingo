When DEBUG logging level is turned on the toString() method of RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor is invoked prior to the setPatterns() method being called to populate the patterns property of the advisor.  The toString() method invokes getPointcut() which creates the pointcut and attempts to set the patterns used on the pointcut.  The setPatterns() method includes an Assert.notEmpty() on the patterns argument.  When this assertion is fired (again, this only happens with a DEBUG log level), the patterns property has not yet been set, which causes the assertion (and therefore the bean creation) to fail.  A workaround for this is to use constructor-arg injection to set the patterns and advice.
