Symptom: Parameters from two client requests are getting included in the same web services call.
(Relevant piece of stack is below)
See method JaxRpcPortClientInterceptor.invoke() for the case where the interface implements Remote.
Problem is instance variable portStub.
This portStub in initialized in JaxRpcPortClientInterceptor.prepare() which only gets called once.
In the prepare method, jaxRpcService.getPort(...) returns an instance of Remote which is stored as portStub.
This guy has the AxisClientProxy which has an org.apache.axis.client.Call instance variable. See code that creates stub in org.apache.client.Service.getPort(String,QName,Class).
If two threads are executing at the same time, the parameter array passed to an org.apache.axis.client.Call.invoke(...) appears to have both request's parameters(or some portion of both depending on timing).
Probably need to call prepare() every time so that we get a new portStub everytime. Should make portStub the return val of prepare. I assume the prepare is done once for performance reasons but how bad can this be to do everytime?
FYI - the quick fix was to use serviceInterface as opposed to portInterface in the context config.
