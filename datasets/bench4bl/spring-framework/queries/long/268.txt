The doTransform method of AbstractXsltView does not match up the content types of the HTTP response stream and the output of the transformer. 
By default it appears the HTTP response stream will set it's charset to 'ISO-8859-1' while the XSLT transformer will output 'UTF-8'. This leads to HTTP responses like:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Language: en-GB
Date: Tue, 17 Aug 2004 14:40:11 GMT
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Connection: close
<html>
   <head>
     <META http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
The transformer should match the response:
trans.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.ENCODING), response.getCharacterEncoding());
