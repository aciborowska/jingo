In Spring 3.0.4 this works as expected but was regressed in 3.0.5
We have a parameter in a method that looks like this:
@RequestParam(value = "removeList", required = false) List<Long> removeList
Where the parameter removeList on the page is a collection of checkboxes like below:
<input type="checkbox" value="7792" name="removeList">
The method is getting Strings instead of Longs though so we get exceptions in the method when the type isn't what is expected.
