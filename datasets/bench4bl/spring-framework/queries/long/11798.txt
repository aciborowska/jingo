I am trying to run spring 4 mvc application in servlet 3 container (tomcat 7).
I have implemented ApplicationListener<ApplicationEvent> to receive notification on session creation and session destroy events. 
Whenever I try to access my application, I am getting NPE at below code in HttpSessionEventPublisher
getContext(event.getSession().getServletContext()).publishEvent(e);
I have further debugged the code and noticed that following getContext method is returning null instead of applicationContext. The webapplication context is not being set for key "WebApplicationContext.ROOT_WEB_APPLICATION_CONTEXT_ATTRIBUTE" in servlet context hence causing NPE.
Thanks,
Amit
