The documentations says (on page 77) that BeanWrapperImpl registers a StringArrayPropertyEditor by default. This is however not the case. According to the change log, this has been removed since Spring 2.0 m-4. Also the java doc for class org.springframework.beans.PropertyEditorRegistrySupport refers to org.springframework.beans.propertyeditors.StringArrayPropertyEditor even though it's never actually registered.
