In the ResourceEditor, there's a bug in the setAsText(String) method.
The try catch should be in a else block from the first if or have a return after the setValue(String) call.  As it is, values with "classpath:path/filename.ext" will not work if using directly the ResourceEditor.  In CVS, the method has path resolving with system properties added, but the problem reported here is still present.
<< Simplified snippet >>
public void setAsText(String text) throws IllegalArgumentException {
  if (text.startsWith(CLASSPATH_URL_PREFIX)) 
{
    setValue(new ClassPathResource(
      text.substring(CLASSPATH_URL_PREFIX.length())));
  }
  try 
{
    URL url = new URL(resolvedPath);
    setValue(new UrlResource(url));
  }
 catch (MalformedURLException ex) 
{
    setValue(new ClassPathResource(text));
  }
}
