MimeMessageHelper's refined strategy (introduced in Spring 1.2.1) that works on Outlook 2003 and Lotus Notes seems to cause problems on Outlook 2000. Use of "multipart/mixed" and "multipart/related" needs to be revisited: we might need configurable behavior there. 
Effectively a compatibility issue with MIME mail structure, which needs to be solve to offer MimeMessageHelper's inline/attachment conveniences in a compatible fashion.
