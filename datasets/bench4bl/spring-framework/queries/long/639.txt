The following code exists in jdbc.support.SQLErrorCodesFactory.getErrorCodes(), which gets called frequently and spams the log file. Would it possible to change it debug or to make it so that it only gets called once ?
// could not find the database among the defined ones
if (logger.isInfoEnabled()) {
	logger.info("SQL error codes for '" + dbName + "' not found");
}
