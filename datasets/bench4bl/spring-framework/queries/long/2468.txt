I seem to be getting a double escaping issue where my form tags are escaping the ampersand from escaped entities like so:
<input id="name" name="name" type="text" value="&quot;The Park&quot; - Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park" size="40" maxlength="100"/>
so that what appears as the value of the form field is:
"The Park" - Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park
instead of:
"The Park" - Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park
I don't have "defaultHtmlEscape" set in web.xml â€“ I simply set "htmlEscape" to true in the tags. If I do set "defaultHtmlEscape" I get the same problem. If no escaping is turned on, the double quotes are directly written to the page and the tag breaks:
<input id="name" name="name" type="text" value=""The Park" - Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park" size="40" maxlength="100"/>
Has anyone else encountered this? So far I love the form tags, but this is a show stopper for me.  I have a thread open in the forums:

but nobody seems to be responding.
