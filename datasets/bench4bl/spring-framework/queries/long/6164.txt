Suppose we have the controller request mapping as the following
 @RequestMapping(value = "/my/
{vari}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
 @ResponseBody
    public String getVari(@PathVariable String vari) {
        System.out.println("vari=" + vari);
        return vari;
    }


If a request such as  "http://localhost/myapp/my/abc.mycontroller.com" is submitted, the actually value of 'vari' obtained by Spring API only returns 'abc.mycontroller'.  

Further investigation turns out the issue is at line 564 in https://src.springframework.org/svn/spring-framework/tags/spring-framework-3.0.0.RC1/org.springframework.web.servlet/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/annotation/AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter.java. The pattern generated by the line results in "{vari}
.*". With  the 'pathMatcher' (the matcher used at line 565) object created by AntPathStringMatcher("
{vari}
.*", "abc.mycontroller.com", map), the value of 'vari' will be 'abc.mycontroller' in the 'map' variable after executing line 566.
