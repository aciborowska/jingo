Instantiating class JavaMailSenderImpl causes a method-not-found exception for Session.getInstance(properties);
This is because this method does not exist in the version of mail.jar included in the lib/ext directory of the version 1.3 JDK packaged with WebSphere 3.5. 
The fix is to change the method call to Session.getInstance(properties(), null); 
There are two locations that require changing - near line 86 and line 124
