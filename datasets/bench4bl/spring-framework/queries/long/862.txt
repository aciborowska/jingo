I am trying to use the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext to load up a bean config file using pattern matching as explained in 'PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver'.  I have a test set up and have a 'resources' folder visible in my classpath but for some reason I cant seem to load this config file up.  However if I supply the absolute file name it works fine.
I have tried many different varations of the configLocation ("-applicationContext.xml", "classpath:-applicationContext.xml",etc) but none seem to work either.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
Here is sample code:
//-------------------------------------------------
String[] configLocations = "classpath*:resources/*-applicationContext.xml"
ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(configLocations);
MyBean bean = (MyBean) context.getBean("myBean");
//---------------------------------------------------
