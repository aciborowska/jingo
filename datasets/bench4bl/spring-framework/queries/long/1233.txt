tearDown() method in JUnit declares that it throws any Exception, but onTearDownInTransaction() and onTearDownAfterTransaction() doesn't declare this, so all checked exeptions must be caught.
I want to close a DB connection used for DbUnit, which was created in onSetUpBeforeTransaction() and I have to catch SQLException which looks to me as non conventional.
(In fact due to the rollback capability of this test class I can close the connection immediately after pre-filling the DB so will not need this, but just to point out "the little bug".)
