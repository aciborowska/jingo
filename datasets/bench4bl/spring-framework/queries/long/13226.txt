After upgrading from Spring Framework from 4.2.0.RC1 to RC2 I've got empty page instead of 404 error.
I've found out that error occurs at ResponseStatusExceptionResolver.resolveResponseStatus() (that was changed in 0ef8af4798222eccfa69d3e3a0c339b170e6d072: commit during fixing SPR-11193):






		int statusCode = responseStatus.code().value();




		String reason = responseStatus.reason();




...




		if (!StringUtils.hasLength(reason)) {




			response.setStatus(statusCode);




		}




		else {




			response.sendError(statusCode, reason);




		}






My application is throwing the custom exception that looks like this:






@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)




public class NotFoundException extends RuntimeException {




}






When exception arrives to ResponseStatusExceptionResolver it turns out that it doesn't have a reason and hence instead of sendError(), setStatus() is invoked.
I see there 2 problemes:
1) I don't know why, but setStatus() doesn't lead to showing the error page
2) Algorithm of getting the reason may be improved by invoking HttpStatus.getReasonPhrase() when ResponseStatus.reason() is empty
This bug report addresses to last problem.
Also I'm not sure where to post my first problem: I'm using Spring Boot and there is a chance that the problem somewhere in Boot's code. So, probably, you could give me advice about it.
