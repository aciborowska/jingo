The implementation of MockHttpSession.getAttributeNames() was changed in Spring Framework 3.2.1 to return an enumeration created from the attributes collection in the session:






-    return new Vector<String>(this.attributes.keySet()).elements();




+    return Collections.enumeration(this.attributes.keySet());






This causes a ConcurrentModificationException if a session attribute is removed while iterating through the enumeration. This also makes the mock less usable as it does not reflect the behavior in servlet containers like Tomcat:






Set<String> names = new HashSet<String>();




names.addAll(attributes.keySet());




return Collections.enumeration(names);
