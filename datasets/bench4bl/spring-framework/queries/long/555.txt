When creating a mock test with the web mock jar, using the class org.springframework.mock.web.MockHttpServletRequest, I found that the following does not have the expected result:
request.addParameter("item", "val1");
request.addParameter("item", "val2");
A hashtable is being used in the source to hold the params, so the second one overwrites the first. The expected result was that request.getParameterValues("item") should return a String[] array with the two values that were added.
This prevents binding of String[] command params in the test code.
Forgive me if I am missing something.
Thanks.
