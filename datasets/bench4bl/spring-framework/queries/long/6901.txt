Using the regular task:scheduler element in conjunction with the task:scheduled-tasks element, results, at least with Tomcat, in a server that is unable to shut down.
The server hangs after having logged the following statement:
Destroying singletons in org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory@d81cda: defining beans []; parent: org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory@1d49247
Manually defining a task scheduler and setting the threads to run as daemon provides a workaround:
	<task:scheduled-tasks scheduler="taskScheduler">
		<task:scheduled ref="myTask" method="run" cron="0 0 0 * * ?"/>
	</task:scheduled-tasks>
	<bean id="taskScheduler" class="org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskScheduler">
		<property name="daemon" value="true"/>
	</bean>
However this is only a workaround, and the default behavior should work out of the box. As you can see from the forum post reference, I am not the only one facing this issue.
