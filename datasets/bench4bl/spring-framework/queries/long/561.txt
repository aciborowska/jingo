When calling jdbcTemplate.queryForList(query, args[]) on oracle, an exception will be thrown if one of the args is a null object.
The following exception will be raised:
java.sql.SQLException: Invalid column type
Oracle expects a setNull to be used rather than setString(null)
This seems to be a similar bug to SPR-50

That was already fixed for callable statements and oracle
