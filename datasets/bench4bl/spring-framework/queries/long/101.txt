I think the new implementation of AbstractMessageSource causes problems in configurations with hierarchical application contexts. 
Here is an example:

The parent context does not declare any message source bean (interface ApplicationContext extends MessageSource)
The child context declares a message source with useCodeAsDefaultMessage set to true.

The childs messages source automatically gets the parent context as its parent message source set. Resolving a message code that is not declared the parent message source gets called and throws a NoSuchMessageException that is not caught by the message source of the child and thus causes runtime exceptions not expected.
