I have a webapp that uses JSTL and the <fmt:message> tag a lot.  I have setup default resource bundles using the context-param javax.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.localizationContext inside the web.xml.
Spring is setting that parameter to an instance of  org.springframework.context.support.MessageSourceResourceBundle.  Which might be OK if I specified one in my application context, but I didn't. 
I'm sure I never set it, because I see this message in the log:
INFO: Unable to locate MessageSource with name 'messageSource': using default [org.springframework.context.support.StaticMessageSource: {}]
Maybe if I set it in my appContext, it would override what I specify in my web.xml.  But if I never set it up, what I specify in web.xml should be the default.
As a workaround, I'll go ahead and set up a Message Source in Spring's App Context.  In the future, if one is not specified, it shouldn't attempt to set any context parameters.  Or, if so, be more explicit about it.
Thanks!
