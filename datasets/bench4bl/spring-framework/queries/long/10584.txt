A sample method defined as follows:
@RequestMapping(value = "/test")
public String testMethod(Integer n) 
{
  if (n == null)
    // do something
  else
    // do something else
  }

stopped working in Spring 3.2.3 (works fine up to 3.2.2) because calling the url like:
http://hostname/context/test?n=
raises a MissingServletRequestParameterException while it should not (it should put a null in n) breaking completely the compatibility with existing apps.
