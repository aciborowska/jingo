AbstractMessageSource calls MessageFormat.format without synchronizing. 
MessageFormat is not threadsafe. While I don't know if MessageFormat itself has any race condition bugs, it does integrate the other java.text classes, such as DateFormat. Example format string that integrates other formats: "This is test number 
{0,number,#0}
  on date 
{1,date,yyyy-MM-dd}
"
And DateFormat is not threadsafe: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do;:YfiG?bug_id=4093418
Other solutions, beside synchronizing methods, include using a per-thread cache, but my hunch is that the overhead of more parsing of strings to MessageFormat objects (per thread) is higher than the synchronization overhead.
