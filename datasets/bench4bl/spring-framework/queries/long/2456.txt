I've just experienced the same problem as Matt Raible in SPR-1198: I get a ClassCastException (String) for this view properties configuration:
reportView.exporterParameters[net.sf.jasperreports.engine.export.JRHtmlExporterParameter.IS_USING_IMAGES_TO_ALIGN]=false
SPR-1198 is supposed to be fixed. Is this a regression in 2.0-RC2?
Using Jasperrepors 1.2.5.
