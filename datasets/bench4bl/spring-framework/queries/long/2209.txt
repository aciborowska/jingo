The onSetUp() method in AbstractTransactionalSpringContextTests calls onSetUpInTransaction() after it starts the transaction. If for some reason, the user overridden code throws an exception, there is nothing catching the exception and ending the transaction. 
Junit has this structure in its test runner.
setUp();
try {
	runTest();
}
finally {
	tearDown();
}
So if setUp() throws an exception, tearDown is not called, and the spring overridden tearDown that rolls back the transaction is not called.
A fix would be to change AbstractTransactionalSpringContextTests.onSetUp() to 
  call the onSetUpInTransaction() method in a try block
  catch any Exception 
  call the endTransaction() method
  rethrow the exception
