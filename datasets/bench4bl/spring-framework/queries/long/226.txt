If more than one BeanNameAutoProxyCreator is defined without an id (which makes sense as they are never referred to by anythnig else) then only the one defined last gets called.
This may apply to all AbstractAutoProxyCreator's or BeanPostProcessor's, but I've only observed it with BeanNameAutoProxyCreator.
