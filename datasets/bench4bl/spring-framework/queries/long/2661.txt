I'm not sure if this is a typo in the reference manual or just confusion on my part.  (I'm just getting started with Spring's transactions.)
On page 161 in the gray box with the sample configuration, it has
 <aop:pointcut id="serviceOperationWithDefaultTxSemantics"
expression="execution(* x.y.service..Service.(..))"/>
And then down below it has
 <!-- these two beans will have the transactional advice applied to them -->
 <bean id="fooService" class="org.xyz.service.DefaultFooService"/>
 <bean id="barService" class="org.xyz.service.extras.SimpleBarService"/>
 <!-- ...and these two beans won't -->
 <bean id="fooService" class="org.xyz.SomeService"/> <!-- (not in the right package) -->
 <bean id="barService" class="org.xyz.service.SimpleBarManager"/> <!-- (doesn't end in 'Service') -->
It seems to me that the classes of the first two beans with the comment "these two beans will have ..." should be x.y.service.DefaultFooService and x.y.service.extras.SimpleBarService.
Also, back on page 159, the gray box sample uses fooServiceMethods but the explanatory text uses fooServiceOperation.
