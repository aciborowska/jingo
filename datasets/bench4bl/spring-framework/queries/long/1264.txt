ServletContextResourcePatternResolver does not  properly resolve patterns when runs on OC4J container. There is a problem in method: doRetrieveMatchingServletContextResources(), when it tries to get ServletContext resources in line (Set candidates = servletContext.getResourcePaths(dir). OC4J conainer returns resources absolut path when getResourcePaths() method is called. In example: "C:/mypathh/oc4j/j2ee/home/applications/myappl/WEB-INF/beans". So, when this condition is evaluated: "StringUtils.countOccurrencesOf(currPath, "/") < StringUtils.countOccurrencesOf(fullPattern, "/")" the result is allways false (usually there are more backslashes "/" in an absolute path than in a regexp).
