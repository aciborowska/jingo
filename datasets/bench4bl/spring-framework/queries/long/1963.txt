In the schema at http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop.xsd the config element has an proxyTargetClass attribute.
In the spring-aop.xsd file in the dist folder of the m4 distribution that attribute is called proxy-target-class.
The only spring-aop.xsd file I have been able to find in the source tree is src/org/springframework/aop/config/spring-aop.xsd, and there the attribute is called proxyTargetClass (in all versions, as far as I can tell).
I have an application which, when deployed to Tomcat, fails with this exception:
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanDefinitionStoreException: Line 20 in XML document from class path resource [conf/Bs400FacadeContext.xml] is invalid; nested exception is org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: cvc-complex-type.3.2.2: Attribute 'proxyTargetClass' is not allowed to appear in element 'aop:config'.
Caused by:
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: cvc-complex-type.3.2.2: Attribute 'proxyTargetClass' is not allowed to appear in element 'aop:config'.

I'm not sure, but assume that this is because it uses the wrong (??) .xsd file supplied with m4.
In m3 it's also proxyTargetClass in the dist/spring-aop.xsd file.
Btw. in Jira issue 1867
Juergen Hoeller says: A CGLIB proxy can be enforced through proxyTargetClass="true"
and Rob Harrob says: To ensure concrete type compatibility set the 'proxy-target-class' attribute of 'aop:config' to 'true'.
Who is right, and where does that file in m4 come from?
Kind regards
