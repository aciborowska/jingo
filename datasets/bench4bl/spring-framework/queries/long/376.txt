Sending inlines, as stated in reference doc (first inlines, then text, p. 17.4.2) doesn't work fine. in such constructed mail message there is no last inline, in place of it the text is inserted (as inline). 
When setting first text, then inlines, everything works fine. ms outlook express displays inlines (images) in text fine.
