If you have an interface than extends from another interface suprisingly only the toplevel interface is exposed by InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler  The problem is that getDeclaredMethods() is used to determine if an interface method should be exposed instead of getMethods().  If for some reason this behaviour is by design I'd really like to be be able to set some sort of flag to override this behaviour
