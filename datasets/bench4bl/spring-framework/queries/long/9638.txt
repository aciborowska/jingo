When one bean tries to find the type of another, via BeanFactory.getType(String), from an initialization method (e.g. InitializingBean), and when the target bean type is expected to be a JDK dynamic proxy, the actual type returned varies depending on whether the target bean is declared before or after the bean interrogating its type.
This is the mechanism used in Spring MVC to discover and cache @RequestMapping methods to invoke. Hence it's necessary to the presence of JDK proxies.
