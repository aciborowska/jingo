The form tag does not resolve correctly the action in a portlet environment. It is easily reproductible with the springmvc portlet sample : https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-webflow-samples/tree/master/booking-portlet-mvc
Deploy this portlet with Spring 3.2.1 or 3.2.2, and click on the "Add Book" button -> error 404
It works fine with Spring 3.2.0.
