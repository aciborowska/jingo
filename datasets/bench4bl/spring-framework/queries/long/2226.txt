We're using Spring to manage the transactions via the Websphere JTA transaction manager.
We use Hibernate 3.1.2 to access the database.
We have a Spring bean with a method, let's say a(), that needs to call another method b() in the same bean.
We attach a transaction to a(), but we want b() to start an inner transaction and we therefore attach a transaction to b() in the ApplicationContext.xml.
Once, we get into the bean, Spring doesn't seem to proxy the methods anymore and doesn't start a new transaction when a() calls b().
Is that the intended behavior? Do we need to add any extra declarations?
