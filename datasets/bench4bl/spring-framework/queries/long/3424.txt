When a parent BeanWrapperImpl creates a nested beanWrapper, it copies its default editors to the child. Now, as PropertyEditorRegistrySupport inits the default editors lazily, it has as defaultEditorsActive property which is not set to true by the default editors copy alone.
In BeanWrapperImpl.getNestedBeanWrapper(String) the child beanWrapper should have defaultEditorsActive to the same value as the parent.
