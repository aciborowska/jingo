class: org.springframework.mock.web.MockHttpServletResponse
The methods getContentAsByteArray() and getContentAsString() assume that this.content contains all data. This is incorrect as the getWriter() method wraps this.content in a OutputStreamWriter and PrintWriter and either of those could be buffering.
I think the best way to fix it is to add this in the beginning of getContentAsByteArray() and getContentAsString():
  if (this.writer != null) 
{
    this.writer.flush();
  }
