Documentation 4.5.4.5 Scoped beans as dependencies says:
"Note: You do not need to use the <aop:scoped-proxy/> in conjunction with beans that are scoped as singletons or prototypes. If you try to create a scoped proxy for a singleton bean, the BeanCreationException is raised."
but implementation for example:






<bean id="districtService" class="com.domain.my.services.impl.DistrictServiceImpl" >




        <aop:scoped-proxy/>




</bean>






doesn't raise any exception. So what's correct?
