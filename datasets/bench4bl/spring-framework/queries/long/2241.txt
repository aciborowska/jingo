The CheckboxTag should not print the input hidden field when the tag is disabled. 
example:
<form:checkbox
                   disabled="$
{disabled?'true':''}
"
                    path="myProperty"
                    />
If you have a tag like this, where myproperty is true and disabled is set to true myProperty will be set to false after submit.
