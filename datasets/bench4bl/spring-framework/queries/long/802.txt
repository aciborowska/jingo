A change between Spring 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 broke backward compatibility in the handling of MessageSource.
I am not specifying a default message source in my application context and was using the inbuilt StaticMessageSource instead.
In the following change:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/springframework/spring/src/org/springframework/context/support/AbstractApplicationContext.java?r1=1.58&r2=1.61
it was removed. This broke my application.
I think this can be fixed by using:
getInternalParentMessageSource(getInternalParentMessageSource() == null ? new StaticMessageSource() : getInternalParentMessageSource());
instead of
dms.setParentMessageSource(getInternalParentMessageSource());
As a workaround one can define a messageSource bean in the application context.
