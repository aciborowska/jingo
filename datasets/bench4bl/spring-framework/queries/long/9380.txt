I have the blow AppConfig class in my project:






@Configuration




@ComponentScan(basePackages = { "my.project" })




@PropertySource({ "classpath:/META-INF/config.properties", "classpath:/META-INF/config-${my.runtime.environment}.properties" })




public class AppConfig {




 




	private static Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(AppConfig.class);




 




	@Bean




	public static PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer propertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer() {




		return new PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer();




	}






Resolving the $
{my.runtime.environment} in the @PropertySource does not work anymore in Spring 3.1.1 while I was just upgrading from 3.1.0.
The same code works fine in 3.1.0 but gives this error in 3.1.1:







 






Failed to load bean class: mt.project.config.AppConfig; nested exception is java.io.FileNotFoundException: class path resource [META-INF/config-${my.runtime.environment}
.properties] cannot be opened because it does not exist






 






The config file exists and the system property is set (I logged that as well), and just to mention it again. In 3.1.0 this works fine.
