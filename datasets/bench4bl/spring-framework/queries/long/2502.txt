Code snipppet that illustrates <tx:annotation-driven> tag (reference guide, 9.5.4, page 159 in PDF) has a bug -
<tx:annotation-driven> tag does not include transaction-manager attribute, which assume "transactionManager"
name for transaction manager bean, but it is named "txManager".
BTW, documentation for tx tags is very scattered in incomplete, it is nopt clear from it which attributes which tag can have,
e.g. for "annotation-driven" tag possibility to specify "transaction-manager" attribute is buried inside quite long code snippet
on page 162 (PDF), 9.5.4.1 and default value for this attribute is not specified at all. 
Definitely, it may be digged out of XML-schema, but it would be much more fair not write 
"These tags are comprehensively covered in the chapter entitled Chapter 9, Transaction management." 
(as coverage is not by no means comprehensive"), but write something like
 "For syntax look into the appropriate xsd (dist\resources\spring-tx.xsd) in Spring distribution",
for tag meaning iexplanation look into Chapter 9.
