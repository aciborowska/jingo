The beans.PropertyTypeConverter class ignores any custom PropertyEditors registered within the PropertyDescriptors created by a custom BeanInfo.
The problem is in the doTypeConversionIfNecessary method, this should call the getPropertyDescriptor method in the BeanInfo class to get the property descriptor, and for JDK 1.5 + call createPropertyEditor to create the editor, or otherwise call getPropertyEditorClass and instantiate the class. 
This change would require that the PropertyTypeConverter take a BeanWrapper as it's constructor argument, rather than a PropertyEditorRegistrySupport since it needs to get access to the bean being edited.
My feeling is that any custom editors registered in the registry should be used first, followed by resolving the editor from the BeanInfo class, and finally fall back to the defaults.
I'll provide a patch shortly.
