Let's consider the following case:






@Configuration




@ImportResource("some.xml")




public class SomeClass { ... }






in some.xml:






<context:component-scan base-package="com.somepackage"/>






in com.somepackage there's class:






@Configuration




public class OtherClass {




Â 




   @Bean(name="SomeNewBean")




   public Object getSomeBean(){ ... }




}






If AnnotationConfigApplicationContext is used against first configuration class only (SomeClass) I assume last configuration class (OtherClass) should be processed as well. However the bean defined inside last configuration class doesn't exist in application context after initialization (refresh).
Some investigation showed that ConfigurationClassPostProcessor is not invoked for OtherClass therefore any annotations inside class never get processed.
