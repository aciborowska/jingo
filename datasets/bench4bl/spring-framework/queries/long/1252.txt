The example: com/**/servlet/bla.jsp - matches org/springframework/servlet/bla.jsp but also org/springframework/testing/servlet/bla.jsp and com/servlet/bla.jsp
should read:  org/**/servlet/bla.jsp - matches org/springframework/servlet/bla.jsp but also org/springframework/testing/servlet/bla.jsp and com/servlet/bla.jsp
I figure when the package naming convention changed from com.interface21 to org.springframework, this javadoc example was just missed...
