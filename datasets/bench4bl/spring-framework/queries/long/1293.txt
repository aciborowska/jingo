AbstractXsltView allows you to set a custom URIResolver. This gets set on the TransformerFactory in initApplicationContext, but this is not sufficient. From Sun's Javadocs:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/xml/transform/TransformerFactory.html#setURIResolver(javax.xml.transform.URIResolver)
Set an object that is used by default during the transformation to resolve URIs used in xsl:import, or xsl:include.
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/xml/transform/Transformer.html#setURIResolver(javax.xml.transform.URIResolver)
Set an object that will be used to resolve URIs used in document().
Hence any uses of the document() function results in the default URIResolver behaviour, which is probably not what you want. setURIResolver needs to be called on every Transformer that is created, i.e. in the doTransform(Node, Map, Result, String) method.
