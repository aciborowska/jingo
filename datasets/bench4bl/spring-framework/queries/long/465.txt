The <spring:message> tag does not work when using Struts as the web tier instead of Spring.  Basically, the MessageTag extends the RequestContextAwareTag, which delegates to RequestContextUtils.  RequestContextUtils looks up items stored in the request by the DispatcherServlet.  So, if you're coming from some other servlet (your own, Struts, etc) you are out of luck.
I think the best solution would probably be to move some methods in RequestContextUtils to WebApplicationContext (e.g. - getLocaleResolver, getLocale).  This approach seems reasonable considering the WebApplicationContext interface already implements the ThemeSource interface.
I was going to try to submit a patch but it looks like the needed changes are a little more involved than I initially supposed, and it looks like there are several potential implementation strategies.
