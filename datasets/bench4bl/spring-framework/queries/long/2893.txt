A problem recently came up on the forum, a user changed the username property in the jdbc.properties file.  This change however did not actually make any difference.  If the username was changed to an invalid value it still worked.  It looks like the username property in the toplink-mappings.xml potentially shouldn't be there <toplink:user-name>sa</toplink:user-name>.
