Configuring a OncePerRequestFilter via a DelegatingFilterProxy is causing a NullPointerException in GenericFilterBean#getFilterName().  
I thought I was misconfiguring something, so I tried copying the ExpiredFlowCleanupFilter configuration from the Spring WebFlow (pr5) itemlist sample app, changed it to use a DelegatingFilterProxy, and received the same NullPointerException.  
My current workaround: my subclass of OncePerRequestFilter implements BeanNameAware and overrides getFilterName() to use the bean name rather than the filter name.
