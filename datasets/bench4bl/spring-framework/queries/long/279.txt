Initial parsing and loading of templates with parsing errors causes Spring to swallow or wrap the exception, reporting instead a generic template loading exception.  If template is fixed and then re-broken, Spring reports the correct FreeMarker exception.  The issue causes problems for debugging of faulty FTL files.
