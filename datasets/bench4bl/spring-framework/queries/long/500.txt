Hello,
I first brought up this issue in the forums:
http://forum.springframework.org/viewtopic.php?t=413&start=0
AbstractWizardController ignores GlobalErrors in validatePagesAndFinish.   It will redirect back to the form page if errors with the fields, but global errors don't redirect.
I consider this a bug.  If not, what is the reason here?
Thanks!
Seth
