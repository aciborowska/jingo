I'm encountering a problem with Autowiring and Factories that seems to be, at the very least, unfortunate, and quite probably unintentional (e.g. a Bug).
Since it's somewhat complicated, and since I described it in the forum system already, I'll point this to that rather than duplicate it.

I've verified that the same thing happens in Spring 1.2.5.  I'd have a hard time isolating this from the larger config, so I haven't yet done so; if I can find the time, I'll try and figure it out.
