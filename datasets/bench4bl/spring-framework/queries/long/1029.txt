The major point is: only the transaction originator can commit or roll back a transaction. Transaction participator should not do that because they don't know if the originator can handle the exception or not.
Currently if I have a transaction that contains insert, update and findBy, the failure of findBy will roll back the whole transaction, which is usually not desired.
