In the Javadoc for JdbcTemplate the following is stated:
<i>All SQL issued by this class is logged.</i>
This is not true for all methods. I'm using the following method public int update(String sql, final Object[] args) throws DataAccessException
And I cannot see the executed SQL in the logs. I only see Executing SQL update using PreparedStatementCreator [org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate$SimplePreparedStatementCreator@16a4a67] which is of no use in my case.
