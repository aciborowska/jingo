When using the bundled ecache1.2.0.jar the application fails. I had to create an ecache.xml file but I still had problems. I upgraded to 1.2.3 of ecache which did not make the problem go away, but at least it is no longer a fatal error.
I suspect the issue has something to do with Hibernate and Spring both using the ecache. 
WARN: Creating a new instance of CacheManager using the diskStorePath "[path removed]" which is already used by an existing CacheManager.
The source of the configuration was classpath.
The diskStore path for this CacheManager will be set to [path removed]\ehcache_auto_created_1158327198515.
To avoid this warning consider using the CacheManager factory methods to create a singleton CacheManager or specifying a separate ehcache configuration (ehcache.xml) for each CacheManager instance.
