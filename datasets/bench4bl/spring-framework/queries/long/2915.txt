I am using the (relatively) new <form> tags, but having the problem that my getAsText() method is not called on my CustomPropertyEditor. However, the setAsText() method gets called fine! I also know the value persists properly because if I change back from a <form> tag to the <spring:bind> tags, it works again (I should clarify that the <spring:bind> tag was not using the getAsText() method either, I was performing comparision by retrieving the id and comparing it directly). This is a snippet from my jsp:
<form:select path="paymentMethod.type">
	<form:option value="" label="" />
	<form:options items="$
{paymentMethodTypes}
" itemValue="id" itemLabel="name"/>
</form:select>
<form:errors path="paymentMethod.type" />
paymentMethodTypes is a list of all possible PaymentMethodTypes. The list populates fine, but the matching value is never 'selected' from the list, so it is as if no selection is made.
