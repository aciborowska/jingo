Here is an example of something I find frustrating about the usually great Ref Manual:
"Note that a bean definition is represented by the real interface
org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanDefinition, and its various sub-interfaces and
implementations. However, it is very unlikely that most user code would ever work with a BeanDefinition.
Besides bean definitions which contain information on how to create a bean, a bean factory can also allow to
register existing bean instances. DefaultListableBeanFactory supports this through the registerSingleton
method, as defined by the org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory
interface. Typical applications purely work with bean definitions, though."
Note the last sentences in each paragraph. Clear as mud, right?
Perhaps we can get this fixed or rewritten to clarify
