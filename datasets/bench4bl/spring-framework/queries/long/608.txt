The javadoc for JmsTemplate.receiveAndConvert defines the return value as "the message produced for the consumer or null if the timeout expires". However, it actually throws a MessageConversionException with the message "Cannot convert JMS message [null] to object". I need to be able to distinguish between a real problem converting and a timeout, which should not be treated as a MessageConversionException, which is what the javadoc indicates it should do.
