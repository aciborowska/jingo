I just had a look at AbstractSlsbInvokerInterceptor#getCreateMethod and found an issue concerning the thrown exception.
If the catch block is executed, the cached EJB-Home will be output as contextual information. However, if caching is disabled, this message will show up "null" as EJBHome instance, which is misleading.
