I am using Spring 1.0M4 on OC4J902. 
My application uses Log4jConfigListener (no rootwebapp property defined). The Listener is defined as the first one in the webapplication, no servlets configured with load-on-startup.
When I start the server an use the app, verything goes smoothly.
When I hotdeploy to a running server afterwards, the method WebUtil.setWebAppRootSystemProperty() throws an exception, saying that the systemproperty DEFAULT_WEB_APP_ROOT_KEY is already defined.
The reason is probably, that System properties is shared between webapps, so the newly loaded app is seing the property from the previous time the app was loaded, and complains because of that.
Suggested solution: Only throw an IllegalStateException, if the Systemproperty is defined already, AND THE OLD VALUE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE NEW ONE.
