FBs themselves are not proxied (which is probably not such a big issue) but
objects FBs depend on (collaborating objects) are not auto-proxied either.
Example:
<bean id="myObject" class="MyFactoryBean">
    <property name="someDependency" ref="myReference"/> </bean>
The <code>myReference</code> bean is not auto-proxied because the
<code>myObject</code> FB is created by getType(). I've used
LazyInitTargetSourceCreator as a work around.
