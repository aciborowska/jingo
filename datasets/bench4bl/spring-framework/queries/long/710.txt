The same thing as SPR-705 happens while using Hibernate.
Since TADSP registers Connection via DataSourceUtils - ConnectionSynchronization object - beforeCompletion closes used connection. And so does SpringSessionSynchronization beforeCompletion - closeSessionOrRegisterDeferredClose (via LocalDataSourceConnectionProvider closeConnection).
Ok, as you said, closing already a closed connection isn't an error by the JDBC API, but that stack trace doesn't look good .
