requiresSession  whether a session should be required for requests to be able to be handled by this controller. This ensures, derived controller can - without fear of Nullpointers - call request.getSession() to retrieve a session. If no session can be found while processing the request, a ServletException will be thrown
That should be requireSession (no s after requires).
