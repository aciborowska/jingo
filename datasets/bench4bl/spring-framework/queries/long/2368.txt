Given the following Map definition:
    <util:map id="someMap"> ... </util:map>
I want to add it to another Map I'm injecting as a property; in the same context file:
    <property name="settingCommandsMap">
        <map>
            <!-- Does not work. -->
            <entry key="Some.Map">
                <ref local="someMap" />
            </entry>
            <!-- Work fine. -->
            <entry key="Some.Map">
                <ref bean="someMap" />
            </entry>
        </map>
    </property>
However, someMap is not recognized as being "local".
