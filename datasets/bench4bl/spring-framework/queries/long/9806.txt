Autowired properties of prototype-beans referencing singletons can remain unset, if ApplicationContext.getBean(...) is called for the prototype-bean concurrently. 
Neither the initialization-type of the singleton, nor the fact, whether the singleton already exists or not, plays a role (i.e. the error occurs even if the singleton is already initialized). 
The error is reproducible even with low concurrency-rates (2 threads).
