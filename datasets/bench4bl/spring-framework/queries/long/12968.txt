Resttemplate with HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory will make HttpMessageConverterExtractor.extractData return null if the header contains content-encoding gzip, the connection is closed and the response isn't chunked
When using Resttemplate with HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory and the response includes content-encoding gzip 
The HttpResponseInterceptor org.apache.http.client.protocol.ResponseContentEncoding  will replace the entity with a org.apache.http.client.entity.GzipDecompressingEntity which always returns -1 as content length.
This will have the affect that 
HttpMessageConverterExtractor.hasMessageBody will return false if the connection is closed and the response isn't chunked
