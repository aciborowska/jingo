Since 3.1 BeanWrapperImpl has a concurrent problem with properties which have only a getter method.
Please see my very simple maven project in the attached zip-file.
The main method of the Starter class produces 3 to 8 exceptions per run with the 3.1.0 and the latest SNAPSHOT of 3.1.1. But if you either uncomment the setter or got back to 3.0.7 it is absolute stable.
I suppose it has something to do with the new introduced ExtendedBeanInfo in CachedIntrospectionResults(L224) but I didn't get it right now.
