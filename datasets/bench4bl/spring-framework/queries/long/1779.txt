The new FORM tags have acouple issues to be handled in my opinion:

no getter methods for the fields like onchange so derived tags can access
TagWriter needs to be public not package private so derived tags can override the write writeTagContent
some fields are protected and others are private, should be consistent
HTML readonly and disabled attributes should be added to HtmlInput Tags
TagSupport.release methods should reset local fields

I think these will help improve the library.
