It isn't possible to use the RecordCreator facility with the CciTemplate when the connector doesn't support RecordFactory creation.
As a matter of the fact, the createRecord method of the CciTemplate catches the NotSupportedException on getConnectionFactory().getRecordFactory(), encapsulates it in a RecordTypeNotSupportException and throws it. So the creation of the record with the RecordCreator is never done...
The CICS connectors work like this.
The workaround is to wrap the ConnectionFactory configured for the connector by a class that allows RecordFactory creation. This created proxy is a simple implementation that returns a RecordFactory which throws exceptions on the calls of its methods.
It would be interesting to integrate this feature directly in the CciTemplate. So the RecordCreator feature would be used even if the connector doesn't support RecordFactory.
