AbstractTransactionalSpringContextTests.onSetup uses the defaultRollback to set complete:
		this.complete = !this.defaultRollback;
This is used in endTransaction to rollback or commit. 
Works in 1.2.6. In 2.0-m2, the startNewTransaction method was added and sets this.complete to false:
		++this.transactionsStarted;
		this.complete = false;
		if (logger.isInfoEnabled()) {
A work around is to call setComplete in onSetupInTransaction (in onSetupBeforeTransaction won't work)
