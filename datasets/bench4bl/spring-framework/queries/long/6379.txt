it's probably related to SPR-5762.
I think, that the issue is in DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader class. In 3.0.0.RC1 there was used call 'ResourcePatternUtils.isUrl(location)', in 3.0.0.RC2 it's changed and I think, that it's related to this correction. 
When the classes are unpacked, it leads to transformation of classpath* URL to file URL, which causes the problem.
Attach is simple test case, which works in 3.0.0.RC1, but fail on 3.0.0.RC2.
