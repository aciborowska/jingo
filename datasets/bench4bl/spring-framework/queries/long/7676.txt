So, let's say we have an enumerated list declared as the following in my Spring XML:
<util:list id="myList" value-type="spring.BasicEnum" list-class="java.util.ArrayList">
        <value type="spring.BasicEnum">ONE</value>
        <value type="spring.BasicEnum">THREE</value>
</util:list>
When I am injecting it in a service bean like this:
@Autowired
@Qualifier("myList")
public void setEnumList(List<BasicEnum> enumList) {
        this.enumList = enumList;
}
I am getting the following container startup exception:
org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No matching bean of type [spring.BasicEnum] found for dependency [collection of spring.BasicEnum]: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate for this dependency. Dependency annotations: {}
I've attached a test case micro project for this.
If @Qualifier is not used, and the list is injected through XML, then everything works as expected.
