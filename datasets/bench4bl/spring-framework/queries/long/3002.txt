The form:errors doesn't take nestedPath into account.
This was annoying for me since I was making use of nestedPath on a few objects that had identical fields. This resulted in non-validating xhtml.
In ErrorsTag.java, I replaced:
protected String autogenerateId() throws JspException {
	return getPath() + ".errors";
}
with:
protected String autogenerateId() throws JspException {
	String path = getNestedPath() == null
		? getPath() : getNestedPath() + getPath();
	return path + ".errors";
}
This seemed to produce a more sane result, however, I'm not familiar enough to know if this is correct.
