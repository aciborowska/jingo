in AbstractJpaTests.runBare() near the end of the main try block the newly constructed context is placed in the cache prior to the refresh: 
    contextCache.put(combinationOfContextLocationsForThisTestClass, cachedContext);
    genericApplicationContextClass.getMethod("refresh").invoke(cachedContext);
If the refresh fails (which is typical in tests) all the beans currently constructed are destroyed and removed from the various collections (eg, "alreadyCreated"). But the context remains the in the test-case cache and is used for the remaining tests. 
What does it mean to continue to use a context for subsequent tests if all the beans have been destroyed?
I would think that these two lines should be swapped. This would bean that if the context fails to refresh due to a non-lazy bean it will fail for all subsequent tests that use the same context. But this seems a more intuitive behavior than simply giving the subsequent tests an empty context.
(PS. Can we add a component for the mock/test code?)
