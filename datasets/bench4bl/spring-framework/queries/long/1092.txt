BindTag and BindErrorTag do not override doFinally, and are left with references to the BindStatus objects and Errors object respectively.  
These references do not allow GC of the status and errors objects.  They remain in the heap until the specific Controller is used again, at which point the references change to the new status and errors and the original are GC'd.  We do have some "large" Command objects and many controllers leading to unnecessary memory usage between requests.
We suggest:
1. org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.BindTag:
public void doFinally() {
   super.doFinally();
   this.status = null;
   this.previousStatus = null;
}
2. org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.BindErrorTag:
public void doFinally() {
   super.doFinally();
   this.errors = null;
}
