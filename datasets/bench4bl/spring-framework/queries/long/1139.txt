InputStream is1 = getStream("source1");
InputStream is2 = getStream("source2");
InputStreamResource source1 = new InputStreamResource(is1);
InputStreamResource source2 = new InputStreamResource(is2);
source1.equals(source2) results in true since
the equals && hashcode method(s) compare the description. This is because of inheriting the implemenation of super class AbstractResource.
And the description is hardcoded to "resource loaded through InputStream" in the constructor for InputStreamResource:
public InputStreamResource(InputStream inputStream) {
 this(inputStream, "resource loaded through InputStream");
}
Is this the desired behaviour?
Thanks,
