In one of my beans, I return a Set of Longs. I use this set to populate a multiple select box on a Web.
I registered an Editor to the field. When doing status.value I expected to get a Set, but I am getting a String. BindStatus reuses the following code from BindException:
        public Object getFieldValue(String field) {
                FieldError fe = getFieldError(field);
                String fixedField = fixedField(field);
                // use rejected value in case of error, current bean property value else
                Object value = (fe != null) ? fe.getRejectedValue() : getBeanWrapper().getPropertyValue(fixedField);
                // apply custom editor, but not on binding failures like type mismatches
                if (fe == null || !fe.isBindingFailure()) {
                        PropertyEditor customEditor = getCustomEditor(fixedField);
                        if (customEditor != null) 
{
                                customEditor.setValue(value);
                                return customEditor.getAsText();
                        }
                }
                return value;
        } 
Here one can see that the customEditor is used but the method getAsText() is used, not the getValue().
I don't understand this choice. It breaks symetry between displaying and submitting my form.
Someone else reported the same issue on the devel list back in September 2004.

Workaround is to respecify my field using its path. Ugly.
Not sure how to fix that. Fixing it would break existing code. Introducing an interface like proposed in the mail in -devel would makes things complex for what is supposed to be normal case to me.
