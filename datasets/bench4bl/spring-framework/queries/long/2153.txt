I've already commented here http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/spring/browse/SPR-1583 that there was introduced a serious bug in Spring's SqlMapClientTemplate in 1.2.7 and 2.0 M2. 
This bug does not allow to use iBatis properly with SqlMapClientTemplate from the version stated above.
Please see my comments here http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/spring/browse/SPR-1583#action_17998
Thanks and regards
