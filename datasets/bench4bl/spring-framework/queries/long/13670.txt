When a test has multiple @ContextConfiguration annotations defined on a base class and a composed annotation then the one defined on the composed annotation is ignored.
I created a small example that illustrates the issue (see reference URL). In this case the TestAppContext defined on the ComposedAnnotation is ignored and therefore the ComposedAnnotationTest fails because the needed bean does not exist.
If the test class is directly annotated with @ContextConfiguration instead of using the ComposedAnnotation it works (see WorkingTest).
