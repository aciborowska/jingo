Section 12.5.2 Chaining ViewResolvers indicates that InternalResourceViewResolver has an order property.  However, IRVR does not implement Ordered, and according to Juergen, will always be positioned as the last resolver in the chain.  The documentaion needs to be updated to reflect the implementation.
