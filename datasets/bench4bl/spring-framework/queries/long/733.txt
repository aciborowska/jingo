A SQL Exception thrown by MySQL with SQLState '41000' and errorCode '1213' and message [Deadlock found when trying to get lock; Try restarting transaction message from server: "Deadlock found when trying to get lock; Try restarting transaction"]
will result in:
org.springframework.jdbc.UncategorizedSQLException: (HibernateTemplate): encountered SQLException [Deadlock found when trying to get lock; Try restarting transaction message from server: "Deadlock found when trying to get lock; Try restarting transaction"]; nested exception is java.sql.SQLException: Deadlock found when trying to get lock; Try restarting transaction message from server: "Deadlock found when trying to get lock; Try restarting transaction"
I believe it should instead result in org.springframework.dao.CannotAcquireLockException, which could be achieved by adding
<property name="cannotAcquireLockCodes"><value>1213</value></property>
to the MySQL bean in sql-error-codes.xml
