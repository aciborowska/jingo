when using CommonsPathMapHandlerMapping to register the web framework controllers, it was not calling the BeanPostProcessors that way the AOP interceptors ware not being aplyied to the attribute configured controllers.
my temporary solution for this problem was change the AbstractPathMapHandlerMapping.initApplicationContext method adding two more lines:
130:handler = beanFactory.applyBeanPostProcessorsBeforeInitialization(handler,handlerClass.getName());
and
136:handler = beanFactory.applyBeanPostProcessorsBeforeInitialization(handler,handlerClass.getName());
but this only works for the interceptors and post processors in the same beanFactory/ApplicationContext, I think the post processors should be inherited from the parent bean factory, like a call to the getBean method
with some thing like this:
in the class org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory
method applyBeanPostProcessorsAfterInitialization and method applyBeanPostProcessorsBeforeInitialization
some code like:
if(getParentBeanFactory() instanceof AutowireCapableBeanFactory)
   ((AutowireCapableBeanFactory)getParentBeanFactory()).applyBeanPostProcessorsBeforeInitialization(bean,name);
for each one respectively.
for now I'm working with an costumized version of AbstractPathMapHandlerMapping, but I think this could help more people 
Thanks. (and sorry for my terrible english)
