I have converted an xml config file into java config. The xml config then and now the java config defined the "messagesource" bean and imported a handful of other xml configs.
Some logic beans defined in the imported xml files depend on messagesource which is now defined in the importing config class - circle closed but exception thrown. As this was working in the pure xml config, I see this as a kind of regression.
I was able to work around here by defining a separate java config file just for the message source and importing this in the main java config as well. But it would be nice if the config interpreter would be able to handle this for me the same way the xml config handler was doing this.
