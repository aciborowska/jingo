I am using ParallelComputer to test spring test cases, but got error
it seems that I am autowiring beans on the same instance, But the @Before method is running on different instances, I think may be it's the SpringJUnit4ClassRunnerâ€˜s issue, or the BlockJUnit4ClassRunner's createTest method, BUT I don't know how to handle this, would you please help me ?
here is a link about this.
