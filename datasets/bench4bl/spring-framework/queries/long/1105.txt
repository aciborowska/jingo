I encountered a weird issue concerning constructors.
I have a bean with four constructors with following signatures
(Set), (Set, Set), (Map), (Map, Set).
The bean specification in the application context provides a single argument like that:
<constructor-arg>
  <map>
    <entry ...
  </map>
</constructor-arg>
However, the constructor with the signature (Set) has been invoked! From debugging DefaultListableBeanFactory#autowireConstructor I saw that all candidate constructors have been found correctly, but the wrong one was chosen. 
Strangely, the argument was not a map but a LinkedHashSet with one element (namely the specified map!).
The effect occured after updating from Spring 1.1.5 to 1.2.2. Unfortunately I have not been able yet to create a small example reproducing the problem. The effect occurs in a rather complex application with a lot of configuration (but there it is reproducible).
My workaround is the specification of the "type" attribute for constructor-arg.
