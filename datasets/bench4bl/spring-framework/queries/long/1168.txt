InputStreamResource - lines 65-67:
	public boolean isOpen() 
{
		return true;
	}

According to the API for this class:
boolean isOpen() 
          This implementations always returns false.
Initial problem that lead to this discovery: ((Resource) inputStreamSource).isOpen() on line 843 of MimeMessageHelper.java returns true and it leads to the IllegalArgumentException
Request: It would be nice to have a helper method that can constract a Resource out of an Object in memory not just off URL, file, classpath:file. That would be very usefull for sending an attachments that do not come of urls.
