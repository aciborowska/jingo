The AbstractJasperReportsView's reportCompiler initialization on line 172 reads:
     private JRCompiler reportCompiler = new JRDefaultCompiler();
However, in JasperReports 1.0.1, the constructor is no longer public.  There is a public getInstance() method, so changing to:
   private JRCompiler reportCompiler = JRDefaultCompiler.getInstance();
should fix.
