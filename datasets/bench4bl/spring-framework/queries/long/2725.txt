current documentation on AOP - chapter 7.5.2. JavaBean properties says:
frozen: controls whether or not advice changes should be disallowed once the proxy factory has been configured. The default is false (i.e. no changes to the proxy configuration are allowed after the proxy has been configured).
That in itself is a contradiction. the first sentence says 'if true its frozen' (which is the default). The part in brackets says the opposite.
Looking at the source code comments:
void org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean.setFrozen(boolean frozen)
Set whether this config should be frozen. 
When a config is frozen, no advice changes can be made. This is useful for optimization, and useful when we don't want callers to be able to manipulate configuration after casting to Advised. 
Obviously by the intuition of naming and by what's in the code, the idea is that once you freeze it you can't change it.
So please change the bracketed part in the docs to read '(i.e. changes to the proxy configuration ARE allowed after the proxy has been configured)'
Maybe get rid of the 'no' and emphasize the 'are'...
