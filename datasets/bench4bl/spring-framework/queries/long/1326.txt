A piece of stacktrace from a running application:
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
	at org.springframework.jms.JmsException.<init>(JmsException.java:59)
	at org.springframework.jms.IllegalStateException.<init>(IllegalStateException.java:29)
	... 39 more
Of course the fix is straightforward, but it would still be nice to have the issue fixed in the main distribution.
