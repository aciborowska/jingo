BeanWrapperImpl#getPropertyValue fails when attempting to load a value from a Map of Lists when the keys are anything other than Strings. For example, say your bean has a property "map" whose type is Map<Integer, List<Whatever>>.  This will successfully load an individual list:
List<Whatever> list = beanWrapper.getPropertyValue("map[3]")
This, however, will fail to load a single element:
Whatever w = beanWrapper.getPropertyValue("map[3][1]")
The immediate cause is that the second call does bean.getMap().get("3") â€“ i.e., the key isn't converted to an Integer.  Since it works in the first case, it seems like it should be workable in the second case.
I've got a self-contained test case which I will attach.
