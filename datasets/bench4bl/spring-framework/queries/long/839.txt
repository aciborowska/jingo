SingeColumnRowMapper needs a public no-arg constructor and it needs to expose the requiredType member variable as a JavaBeans property.
Use case: I need to use a SingleColumnRowMapper in my implementation of a ResultSetExtractor.  I have all my row mappers and result set extractors configured in my application context.  The SingleColumnRowMapper(Class) constructor is appropriate for programmatic use, but for declaration in an application context I would like to be able to use property injection rather than constructor injection.
