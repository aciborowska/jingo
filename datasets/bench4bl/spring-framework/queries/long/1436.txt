PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver method findAllClassPathResources uses a Set to ensure unique resources given multiple paths to the same file.  The problem is that it uses a HashSet to turn the Enumeration into a Resource[].  HashSet does not return the URLs in the same order.  This should be changed to LinkedHashSet which will return them in the insertion order.  This is vital for resources that show up in WebLogic's APP-INF/classes and then in WEB-INF/classes with the web app meant to take precedence (ie be last on the list).  The enumeration is in the right order but the resulting array may or may not be.  A quick change to LinkedHashSet will preserve order.
