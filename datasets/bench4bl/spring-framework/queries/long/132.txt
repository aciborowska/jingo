Some comments in DispatcherServlet are incorrect.
From current CVS HEAD:
	/**

Well-known name for the ViewResolver object in the bean factory for this namespace.
Only used when "detectAllViewResolvers" is turned off.
@see #setDetectAllViewResolvers
	 */
	public static final String HANDLER_MAPPING_BEAN_NAME = "handlerMapping";

	/**

@see #setDetectAllViewResolvers
	 */
	public static final String HANDLER_EXCEPTION_RESOLVER_BEAN_NAME = "handlerExceptionResolver";
