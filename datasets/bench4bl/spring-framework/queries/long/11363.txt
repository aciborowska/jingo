Hello,
i have two test classes:
First testclass: derived from class AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests, uses annotation @EnableSpringConfigured
Second testclass: plain TestNG-Test without spring context, tries to instantiate a @Configurable-annotated-class
Maven runs the testcases in the order given above. When the second testclass is run and the @Configurable-annotated-class is constructed, a NoSuchBeanDefinitionEception is thrown.
I assume that the spring-context of the first testclass is not automatically destroyed. 
Further investigation showed:
1. adding @DiritiesContext to the first testclass resolves the problem.
2. running AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect.aspectOf().destroy() before the second test-class is executed resolves the problem.
Best Regards, Andreas
