If you have a context with an instance of TimerFactoryBean, and don't set any scheduledTimerTasks into it, then you get a NullPointerException in afterPropertiesSet().  
This is because TimerFactoryBean is assuming that it will have a non-null array of tasks.
The reason I'm not injecting any tasks is because I want to inject the Timer itself into my own beans, and don't need or want the tasks to be configured in spring.
