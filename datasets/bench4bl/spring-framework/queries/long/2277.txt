I wasn't planning on filing this issue, since I was taking it as an inevitable part of the Spring 1->2 transition, but since the RC2 release announcement stresses people mentioning backwards compatiblity issues, I thought I'd mention it.
Anyway, under Spring 1, we had some code which manually manipulated a TransactionProxyFactoryBean in java, not using a beanfactory.  We used the setProxyInterfaces(String[]) method.  In Spring 2, this has become setProxyInterfaces(Class[]).  This is unquestionably better, but the fact is it's not backward compatible.
I'm not sure if your commitment to backwards compatibility extends to this sort of usage.
