Already reported and fixed in 3.0.5 (see SPR-7557) for MockHttpSession, but re-appeared in 3.2 (was still OK in 3.1)
Similar problem happens in MockHttpServletRequest.
The method getAttributeNames() returns an Enumeration, and when looping over this enum to remove attributes, you get ConcurrentModificationException. Example:






HttpSession session = new MockHttpSession();




session.setAttribute("k1", "v1");




session.setAttribute("k2", "v2");




for (Enumeration<String> names = session.getAttributeNames(); names.hasMoreElements();) {




   session.removeAttribute(names.nextElement());




}






The fix that was done in 3.0.5 solves the problem: it consists in replacing this code






return Collections.enumeration(this.attributes.keySet());






with this code:






return new Vector<String>(this.attributes.keySet()).elements();
