I was trying out the samples of DI thru AspectJ integration. Great stuff!
One problem though. If  POJOs compiled with the aspects woven in, and used without the container present in VM, they throw NPE on instantiation. The culprit seems to be org.springframework.beans.factory.aspectj.AbstractBeanConfigurer's method confugreBean.
So if I want to unit test (setting dependents manually) my classes I really can't, due to NPE.
method
    protected void configureBean(Object bean, String beanName) 
{;
            this.beanFactory.applyBeanPropertyValues(bean, beanName);
    }

and it should probably be 
    protected void configureBean(Object bean, String beanName) 
{;
        if (this.beanFactory != null)
            this.beanFactory.applyBeanPropertyValues(bean, beanName);
    }
