The "targetSet" member variable in ThreadLocalTargetSource should be using a synchronized set instead of the regular HashSet.
Mutiple threads can call the getTarget() method (..which modifies the targetSet) at the same time.
Change the following :
private Set targetSet = new HashSet();
to :
private Set targetSet = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet());
