LocalSessionFactoryBean.dropDatabaseSchema() does not work with Postgresql if the schema is already there and you change a name
in the table names. This happens because once a command fails postgres won't process further commands in the same transaction.
As a workaround, simply use autocommit=true in executeSchemaScript.
There are other problems tought. For example, if you change a foreign key name in the mapping file, dropping won't work because the old foreign key won't be removed (and thus the tables won't be removed). I guess this is a Hibernate problem, thought, that should generate a DROP TABLE xxx CASCADE instead of a simple DROP TABLE xxx
