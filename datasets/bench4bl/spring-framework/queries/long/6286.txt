Autowired is a great function, but seems can not work with @Transactional, for example, a class like
@Service
@Transactional
public class TheService() {
...
}
When we use @Autowired and packagesToScan, any RuntimeException can't cause rollback, transction doesn't work.
Then we declare this bean in applicationContext.xml, it is OK. 
I found there is a similar issue: http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-5082
