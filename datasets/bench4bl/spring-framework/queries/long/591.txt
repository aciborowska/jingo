AbstractPdfView mentions the following in renderMergedOutputModel(), but I can't find this "hack" anywhere for JasperReportsPdfView.  
// The following simple method doesn't work in IE, which
// needs to know the content length.
// PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.getInstance(document, response.getOutputStream());
// document.open();
// buildPdfDocument(model, document, writer, request, response);
// document.close();
// See http://www.lowagie.com/iText/faq.html#msie
// for an explanation of why we can't use the obvious form above.
Basically it means that response.setContentLength(baos.size()); should be called.
I tried to download a PDF generated with JasperReports and got a page with some binary data, instead of the PDF.  Probably this is related with this issue?
Since I need to do a release tomorrow, I changed to the AbstractPdfView for now, but I will certainly try/learn Jasper in the near future.  Maybe then I can provide a testcase for this.
