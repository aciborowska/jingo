Hi, 
I was trying to develope some ajax application, the response is rendered by Velocity in Spring Framework. But may have two kinds of content-type in one application: xml or html.
Since VelocityView always resets response header content-type even you already set it in your action implementation. The xml response will be recognized as HTML in browser.
I suggest we add a check in renderMergedTemplateModel , see below.
	/**

Process the model map by merging it with the Velocity template.
Output is directed to the servlet response.
<p>This method can be overridden if custom behavior is needed.
	 */
	protected void renderMergedTemplateModel(
			Map model, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws Exception 
{

               if(response.getContentType()==null)                       //added 
		     response.setContentType(getContentType()); //default content-type
               }
                                                                                        //added 

		exposeHelpers(model, request);
		// create Velocity Context from model
		Context velocityContext = createVelocityContext(model, request, response);
		exposeHelpers(velocityContext, request, response);
		exposeToolAttributes(velocityContext, request);
		doRender(velocityContext, response);
	}
Thanks! SpringFramework is great!
