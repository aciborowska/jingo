Compiling reports on the fly does not work (anymore) using JasperReports 1.0. Somehow, JR seems to use the Java classpath to compile reports in for example the JRJdk12Compiler (using System.getProperty(java.class.path)), which does not work of course in a web app environment.
I think it's best to remove the option to compile reports on the fly, unless you have a better idea...
For the time being, I've changed the sample application to NOT do on the fly compilation of reports anymore.
