I'm taking a first look at Spring 2.0, this is done by upgrading a Spring 1.2.6 based application. I transformed all of my
DTD based configuration files to schema based configuration files using the following:
<sp:beans  xmlns:sp="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"   <--With a namespace prefix
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
The problem is that Spring fails to find any bean, when omitting  the namespace prefix, as in
<beans  xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" <-- w/o a namespace prefix
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
It works.
My suggestion 
I looked on the code a little bit and from a quick look I can see on DefaultXmlBeanDefinitionParser.jave:
........
line 380: else if (BEAN_ELEMENT.equals(ele.getNodeName())) {
........
I suspect that ele.getLocalName() would solve the problem (on line 380 and some other places on the file)
