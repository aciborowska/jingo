Juergen,
The check to not override a content type previously set on the response that you introduced a couple of days ago in FreeMarkerView & VelocityView uses response.getContentType(), which is apparently servlet 2.4 specific. It throws a NoSuchMethodError on WLS 8.1sp2 ... Maybe you can code the check more defensively, or just remove it again?
