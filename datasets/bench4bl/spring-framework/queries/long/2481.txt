Abstract methods inherited from a superinterface (which are not implemented in target class) can not be replaced in a BeanFactory.
Suppose there exists:
public insterface MyInterface {
  void myMethod();
}
public abstract MyClass implements MyInterface {
}
you can not define "MyClass" as a bean, and replace myMethod in it (with a methodReplacer)! or you must redeclare "myMethod" in "MyClass"!
