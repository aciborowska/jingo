SQLErrorCodesFactory has several logger.info that are frequently called and which fill up the logs 
especifically: org.springframework.jdbc.support.SQLErrorCodesFactory getErrorCodes
On another related topic, as a much lesser issue ( as it's only called once ), 
org.springframework.web.servlet.view.AbstractCachingViewResolver resolveViewName also has logger.info that logs that a controller has been cached... Shouldn't that also be a .debug log ?
