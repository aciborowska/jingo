The example code in the JPA section (12.7) appears to have a problem.  In most of the examples there is a block of code that looks like this:
Query query = em.createQuery("from Product");
List result = query.execute(category);
Based on this documentation (http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Query.html) I think it actually needs to be:
Query query = em.createQuery("from Product as p where p.category = :category");
query.setParameter("category", category);
List result = query.getResultList();
