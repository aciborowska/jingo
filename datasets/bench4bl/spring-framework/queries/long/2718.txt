Default-scoped and protected methods annotated as @Transactional are properly recognized by aspect but call to  createTransactionIfNecessary(method, txObject.getClass()) from AbstractTransaction aspect returns unusable TranactionInfo object - both transactionAttribute and transactionStatus are null.
I would attach a small test program that illustrates it. 
In RC3 it has worked (after small tweaking of pointcut in AnnotationTransactionAspect to allow non-public methods).
