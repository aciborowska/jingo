If one of my beans implements an interface such as BeanFactoryAware, and then annotates setBeanFactory() with @Required, then RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor will complain that the beanFactory property hasn't been set, even though the container has injected the beanFactory automatically.
From the bean's perspective, the beanFactory property is no different to any other property, and should be treated similarly by the container.
The same applies to the other *Aware interfaces (ApplicationContextAware, BeanNameAware, etc)
