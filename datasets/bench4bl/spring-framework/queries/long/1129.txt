The problem is that if you have a bean A that has a constructor argument that expects to be expanded by a PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer, but use A as a factory bean to create bean B, A appears to be constructed before the PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer ever gets a chance to expand A's constructor parameters.
The attached simple unit test demonstrates the problem.  It works against 1.2.1 but not 1.2.2
