Here are some typos and unclear sentences which I've this far found from
http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/beans.html
>> 3.2.3. The beans
"other beans a bean needs to do its work, i.e. collaborators (also called dependencies)."
I had some trouble understanding this sentence. It could be reformatted for example to "other beans which are needed for the bean to do its work..."
>> 3.2.3.1. Naming beans
"When using XM-based configuration metadata"
is missing one L from XML. It should be:
"When using XML-based configuration metadata"
>> 3.3.1.3. Some examples (last sentence)
"An instance (non-static) factory method would be used in an essentially identical fashion (aside from the use of the factory-bean attribute instead of the class attribute), so will not be detailed here."
The part "so will not be detailed here" sounds a bit weird, maybe because the subject of the sentence is unclear. This could be reformatted for example to "so details will not be discussed here".
>> 3.3.3. Bean properties and constructor arguments detailed
"Springs XML-based configuration metadata"
should be
"Spring's XML-based configuration metadata"
