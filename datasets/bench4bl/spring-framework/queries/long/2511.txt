Documentation for BaseCommandController <http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/BaseCommandController.html#createCommand()>
states:
"This implementation uses BeanUtils.instantiateClass, so commands need to have public no-arg constructors."
But it works with private Constructors, too, as documented in BeanUtils.instantiateClass:
"Note that this method tries to set the constructor accessible if given a non-accessible (i.e. non-public) constructor."
Proposal:
"This implementation uses BeanUtils.instantiateClass, so commands must not have public no-arg constructors."
