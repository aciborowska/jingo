The javadoc of the StoredProcedure class states the following:
"This class is abstract and its execute methods are protected,
preventing use other than through a subclass that offers tighter typing."
However, the execute-methods are public. And also is the declareParameter method.
I do not know when that discrepancy entered; also in the oldest version I have around (1.2.2) this case exists. I agree completely with the documented facts and its intentions and would therefore suggest to reduce the visibility of the mentioned methods to "protected" (maybe making them "final" as well).
Perhaps this might be a problem for 1.2.9 (if that will be published), because of compatibility issues. Anyway I would suggest to make this change in 2.0.
