With SPR-4785 support for default values was added.
However, I observed that they are applied too early if you have a hierarchy or cascade of property placeholder configurers:

Spring loops through the prioritized list of configurers
if property X is not found in the first configurer the default value is returned
--> the whole list should be processed first before the default value is used
