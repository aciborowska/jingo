currencyTimeLimit=-1 below has no effect since it doesn't override the default currencyTimeLimit=0 provided by ManagedResource. AFAIK from the spec I should be able to override currencyTimeLimit for each managed attribute?
@ManagedResource(objectName="Scheduler", description="The scheduler is responsible for running jobs")
public class SchedulerImpl extends java.lang.Thread implements ApplicationListener, ApplicationContextAware, InitializingBean, BeanNameAware, Scheduler {
	@ManagedAttribute(description="Number of works in the queue waiting to be executed", currencyTimeLimit=-1)
	public String getNow() 
{
		return new Date().toString();
	}

}
