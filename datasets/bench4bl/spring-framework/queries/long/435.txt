Macromedia JRun has a bug in it's handling of tag libraries. Essentially, they mishandle the default value of <declare/> inside the TLD <variable/> element (XPath: /taglib/tag/variable)...this default value SHOULD BE true, but in JRun, it's set to false. It is not entirely clear to me how this causes the problem, but the result is that JSP code like:
<spring:bind path="command.firstName">
  <c:out value="$
{status.value}
"/>
</spring:bind>
will result in a JRun error that states something to the effect of:
<paraphrase>
Variable "status" cannot be found.
</paraphrase>
I have found a Macromedia forum entry for this error:

Basically, the workaround is for the spring.tld to be more explicit. Simply adding <declare>true</declare> to any <variable/> element section will make the TLD compatible with this version of JRun.
By looking at:
http://forum.springframework.org/viewtopic.php?p=6728#6728
I see that this is still a problem with the TLD in Spring-1.1.x, so I suggest that it be fixed in both versions...
