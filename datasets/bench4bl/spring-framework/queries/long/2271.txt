All versions of Spring up to 2.0 RC1 have ApplicationContext getApplicationContext() as public scope. Suddenly it has protected scope in RC2. This breaks backwards compatibility – and my code – and there is no explanation for this change. Is there a good reason behind this? It is not at all compatible with 1.x code or < 2.0 RC2.
