I attempted to upgrade from Spring 1.2.1 to 1.2.2 and with 1.2.2 a lot more of my beans are displaying:
"Bean 'XXXXX' is not eligible for getting processed by all BeanPostProcessors (for example: not eligible for auto-proxying"
I attempted to step through the code and it appears that many more beans are being initialized at the same time my AutoProxy instance is initialized and added as a post processor.  If I downgrade back to 1.2.1 everything works fine again.  Any ideas? Or do you need more information.
