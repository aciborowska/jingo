When running "javadoc" tag of the Ant build script, this target fails when attempting to resolve external link references when the build machine is inside a firewall with an http proxy.
The solution is to modify the "javadoc" task invocation by adding
parameters for the proxy-host proxy-port, which can be configured in
the build.properties file.
