This is actually a problem with the documentation. The Javadoc for MultiActionController states that:
"Controller implementation that allows multiple request types to be handled by the same class. Subclasses of this class can handle several different types of request with methods of the form 
 ModelAndView actionName(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response);" (clipped from doc)
BUT, the visibility must be public since the operation is performed on a delegate (or because of some reflection issue). THIS SHOULD BE CLEARLY STATED.
There are quite a few posts about people having trouble with MultiActionController on the Spring forum. I think this is the culprit.
