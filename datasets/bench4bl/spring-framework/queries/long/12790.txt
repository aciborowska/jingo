Hi,
It appears that in Reactor 2.0, the location of certain classes have moved about and some have been renamed/functionality changed, making the dependency of using Reactor 2.0 for Spring Messaging broken.
For example:
Reactor11TcpClient references these files:






import reactor.net.NetChannel;




import reactor.net.Reconnect;




import reactor.net.netty.tcp.NettyTcpClient;




import reactor.net.tcp.TcpClient;




import reactor.net.tcp.spec.TcpClientSpec;






A couple of examples where classes have been renamed/moved in Reactor 2.0 include:






reactor.net.NetChannel -> reactor.io.net.NetStreams




reactor.net.netty.tcp.NettyTcpClient -> reactor.io.net.impl.netty.tcp.NettyTcpClient




...
