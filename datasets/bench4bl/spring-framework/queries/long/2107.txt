There is an error in the hivemind configuration. There's a line:
<construct class="SpringApplicationInitializer">
If you have this in the hivemind configs, you'll get exceptions when you try to hit your application along the lines about not being able to find the SpringApplicationInitializer class. It seems that it needs to be fully qualified, ie:
<construct class="com.javaforge.tapestry.spring.SpringApplicationInitializer">
