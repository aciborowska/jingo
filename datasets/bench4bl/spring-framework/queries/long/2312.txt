Attempting to switch to idref tag instead of using comman delimited strings in the beanNames property of BeanNameAutoProxyCreator. The docs show this should work. 
I dug a big, but couldn't find the code that converts the idref list into the array of strings.
The following works, both my real beans are proxied and work correctly. But I expected the fake bean in the middle to break the container startup, throwing an exception, but it didn't. The below config has the same behaviour as specifying a comma seperated list of beanNames. I'd like it to work so that type or bean name changes will break the startup instead of silently stop being proxied. Are the docs missing a config option to enable the checking? I can't use local since the beans are defined in a different XML file. 
The docs lead me to believe that the using the bean instead of local should work, just fail a bit later in startup.
Thanks
