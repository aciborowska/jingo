In OracleLobHandler, it assumes the constant
DURATION_SESSION=10
In the classes12.zip that I have (from Oracle 9i) dated 
4/26/2002, the constant is actually
BLOB.DURATION_SESSION=1
If you pass '10' into BLOB.createTemporary, it will cause 
an exception (reporting invalid argument).
It looks like you will unfortunately need to use reflection 
and access the value of this field to be compatible...
Like clazz.getField( "DURATION_SESSION" ) where clazz 
is Oracle's BLOB class.
Also, wouldn't it be better to be dynamically loading 
using Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() 
instead of Class.forName()??
