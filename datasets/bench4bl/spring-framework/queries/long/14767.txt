Hi,
it seems after this commit (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/cc5300c4d558e3f86d592ef615104ab9092a34f4) ETag headers are only added to GET/HEAD requests/responses. 
We can't add ETag headers to PUT/POST/PATCH responses anymore.
We are doing conditional POST/PUT/PATCH requests with "If-Match" HTTP header to check that the resource has not been modified concurrently by another client. The response either contains a HTTP 200 Code and the ETag header of the updated resource or a HTTP 412 Precondition failed, if the resource has been modified by another client (when the If-Match header does not match the current ETag header of the resource).
Right now we can't return the ETag of the updated resource anymore.
Kind regards,
Robert Winkler
