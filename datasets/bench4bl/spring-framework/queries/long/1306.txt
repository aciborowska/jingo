org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.SessionFactoryUtils.convertHibernateAccessException converts hibernate StaleObjectStateException to spring's HibernateOptimisticLockingFailureException. But hibernate sometimes throws StaleObjectException (the parent of StaleObjectStateException) when eg. trying to delete a record that has already been deleted. SessionFactoryUtils should convert this to a subclass of ConcurrencyFailureException. Instead, it allows it to be converted to the generic HibernateSystemException.
