If a bean that refers to lookupMapper is instantiated from preInstantiateSingletons() then it's afterPropertiesSet() hasn't called and therefore MethodInvoker.prepare() isn't called before MethodInvoker.invoke() - causing a NPE.
If lookupMapper isn't referred to by any other beans then there is no problem, it is created properly.
