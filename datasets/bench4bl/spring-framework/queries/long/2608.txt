I'm using ReflectiveMethodInvocation.invocableClone in an @Around aspect to implement transaction retries.
However, AbstractAspectJAdvice & AspectJAroundAdvice stash a ProceedingJoinPoint in the MIs userAttributes.  That stashed PJP has a pointer to the original, uncloned, MI, so invoking my cloned MI ends up calling the next interceptor twice (because the interceptorIndex is coming from this stashed PJP/MI).
I think a workaround is to just clear out the stashed PJP, but I haven't tried that yet.
