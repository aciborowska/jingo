When trying to define components through the component-scan feature, one of our classes was stubbornly refusing the be published in the context. after some debugging it seemed that it was "failing" in the ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider.isCandidateComponent()
beanDefinition.getMetadata().isConcrete() is properly returning true, but the beanDefinition.getMetadata().isIndependent() is returning false.
as an aside, there seems to be no logging whatsoever in these classes, making it hard to see which components get published.
