Commit 4dc289592d0072c7472ab455522362f8db42b4a7 inadvertently changed the order that the conversion service searches the type hierarchy.
With Spring 3.1 when considering the hierarchy of ArrayList the converter would search super-types initially followed by interfaces in the order of the super-types.
ie:






ArrayList




AbstractList




AbstractCollection




List (interfaces on ArrayList)




Collection (interfaces on AbstractCollection)






Spring 3.2.0 searches the interfaces starting starting with the base class.
ie:






ArrayList




AbstractList




AbstractCollection




Collection (interfaces on AbstractCollection)




List (interfaces on ArrayList)






This bug is particularly critical when custom converters have been registered againsy List. Instead of the custom converter being used the CollectionToObject converter will be picked as Collection -> Object is considered before List -> targetType.
