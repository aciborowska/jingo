ExpressionEvaluationUtils looks for javax.servlet.jsp.el.ExpressionEvaluator on the classpath instead of actually checking the capabilities of the container. When using MyFaces with Tomcat 4, the jsp-2.0.jar is required to be on the classpath even though JSP 2.0 is not actually supported. This causes a 
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext.getExpressionEvaluator()Ljavax/servlet/jsp/el/ExpressionEvaluator;
when the evaluate method is called. At the very least there should be a way to manually configure this class to behave correctly. But, I would think it would be just as easy to check if the getExpressionEvaluator() method existed on the context.
