When sorting the following array: [/a/b/
{c}/**, /a/b/{c}
/*/, /, //] with the current implementation of AntPathMatcher.AntPatternComparator, the sort order results in: [//, /*, /a/b/
{c}/**/, /a/b/{c}
/**] . In our case, this results in the wrong controller picking up the request.
I believe the problem lies in this block: 
if (totalCount1 != totalCount2) {
	return totalCount1 - totalCount2;
}
and would be correct if instead it returned "totalCount2 - totalCount1;". However, I can't speak to how this may affect other use cases.
