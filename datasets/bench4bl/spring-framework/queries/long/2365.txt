I'm not sure, but I was about 99% sure that your intentions were to support JDK1.4.
ErrorsTag.java fails on line 97
The signature of addAll(Collection c, Object...a) exists only in JDK1.5
You JDK1.5 specific call:
Collections.addAll(errorMessages, getBindStatus().getErrorMessages());
in JDK1.4 it should look like this:
errorMessages.addAll(Arrays.asList(getBindStatus().getErrorMessages()));
