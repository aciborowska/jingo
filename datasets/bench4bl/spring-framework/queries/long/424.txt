Constructor autowiring will always fail if there's at least one abstract bean in context, specially if this is the first defined bean. The problem here is that DefaultListableBeanFactory.findMatchingBeans() will try to instantiate abstract beans, which will always fail.
Attached goes an example applicationContext.xml and a fairly detailed debug output (and stack trace).
