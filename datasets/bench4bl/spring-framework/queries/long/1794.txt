The problem is that AspectJAutoProxyCreator is trying to create an Spring AOP proxy for the AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect which use unsupported AspectJ primitive 'initialization'.
Possible solution: there should be the way to specify which aspects should not be processed by AspectJAutoProxyCreator.
