I think there might be a bug in the documentation for Spring AOP, I have just implemented a RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor and followed the example in section 5.2.3.1.1 (around line 400 in aop.xml for doc src)
The documentation advocates the use (in beans.xml) of a property named "interceptor" to instantiate the 'advisor bean' and register it with the RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor. I kept getting the following error :
Property 'interceptor' is not writable in bean class [org.springframework.aop.support.RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor]
When I checked the RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor src and changed the property name to "advice" in beans.xml it was happy.
This is a very minor bug but also a very minor fix 
sorry if I have gone about the workaround the wrong way, and thankyou for Spring
