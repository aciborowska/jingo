The hibernate version of the petclinic doesn't work on mysql because an obselete version of the mysql jdbc driver (2.0.14) is bundled, which results in the following exception when trying to insert records
java.lang.AbstractMethodError: com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.Connection.prepareStatement
Suggested fix: bundle the latest 3.0.x mysql jdbc driver (this fixes the issue for me).
