RmiServiceExporter displays incorrect binding information when using RmiRegistryFactoryBean
source file: RmiServiceExporter.java
method: afterPropertiesSet()
If a factory has been used to specify the registry, then the local property for port is not needed.  However the logger.info uses the local port number rather than the port defined in the registry variable.  ie. my registry was running on port 4242 but spring was claiming to have bound the service at 1099 (our JBoss RMI port).  Took a while to find this was the problem so watch out 
Cheers
