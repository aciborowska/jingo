In the documentation file spring-framework-2.0/docs/reference/html_single/index.html, section 5.2 says:  "While it is certainly possible to implement a single Validator class to validate each of the nested objects in a rich object, it may be better to encapsulate the validation logic for each nested class of object in its own Validator implementation. A simple example of a 'rich' object would be a Customer that is composed of two String properties (a first and second name) and a complex Address object. Address objects may be used independant of Customer objects, and so a distinct AddressValidator has been implemented."
That 'independant' on the last line should be 'independently'.
