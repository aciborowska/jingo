From the form post:
I upgraded from Spring 3.1.2 to 3.2
After upgrade, all my date variables in forms are failing with joda conversion error.






org.springframework.core.convert.ConverterNotFound Exception: No converter found capable of converting from type java.util.Date to type org.joda.time.ReadableInstant






Sample Code:
Its failing with any of the following options.






<form:input id="startDt" path="startDt" value="2012-10-12" />




<form:input id="startDt" path="startDt" value="10-12-2012" />




<form:input id="startDt" path="startDt" value="10/12/2012" />






Note: startDt is of type java.util.Date
