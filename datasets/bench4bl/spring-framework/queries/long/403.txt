Spring constructor-arg comments state:
"NOTE: it is highly recommended to use the index attribute, in Spring up
to and including 1.1. The constructor matcher is extremely greedy in 
matching args without an index, to the point of duplicating supplied args
to fill in unspecified constructor args, if they are compatible (i.e. one
single String arg will match a constructor with two String args, etc.).
The matcher should be less agressive in a future version."
This doesn't appear to be the case. This only occurs with autowiring. Here's a test case demonstating that a supplied argument isn't duplicated:
<bean id="exampleBean" class="dateformat.Test">
  <constructor-arg type="java.lang.Boolean"><value>true</value></constructor-arg>
</bean>
public class Test {
    public Test(Boolean b, Boolean b2) 
{
        System.out.println("b='" + b + "'");
        System.out.println("b2='" + b2 + "'");
    }
}
