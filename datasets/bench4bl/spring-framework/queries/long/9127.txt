When you create an annotation based configuration class with a @PropertySource annotation that provides multiple .properties files and a name for that property source only one property source gets registered since all ResourcePropertySource s have the same name and thus get overwritten by the subsequent property sources.
Example:






@Configuration




@PropertySource(name = "someName", value = {"classpath:a.properties", "classpath:b.properties"})




public class MyConfiguration {




}






this will only register b.properties in the Environment since 2 ResourcePropertySource}}s with the name {{someName are created and added to the environment.
