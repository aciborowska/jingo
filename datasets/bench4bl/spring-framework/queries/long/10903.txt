When a @RequestMapping specifies produces="foo/bar;param=quux" and a request comes in with Accept: foo/bar;param=xuuq the mapping is still selected.
But the description of the Accept header in RFC 2616 shows that parameters should influence content negotiation.
Unfortunately the handler compatibility check done from RequestMappingHandlerMapping is ultimately performed via isCompatibleWith in MediaType, and this method completely ignores media type parameters.
