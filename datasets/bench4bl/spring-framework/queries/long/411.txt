Juergen,
Can you see this:

Looking at the current implementation of getJtaSynchronizedSession in SessionFactoryUtils, unless I'm mistaken the code is wrong, as it can not handle the case of an existing thread-bound session (as would come from the OSIV filter). In this case, the check for an active tx will match, but there won't be a session bound to the tx key, so the function will return null, not the existing session, and a new session will end up being created...
As I read this code now, it will work fine for the case that a new Session needs to be created and bound to the JTA tx, and it will work fine for the case that a subsequent session request is able to pick up this session bound to the tx, so the only issue is for an existing session created outside of the JTA tx...
