the META-INF/ is a hidden package for isolated ClassLoader, for example as osgi Netbeans plugins
Suppose you want to use Spring in your netbeans plugins application, and your application in split into several plugins depending of each others, you can not start the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext, because it fails to validate xml files, as none of the META-INF/spring.handlers are seen by the ClassLoader of your plugin.
Unfortunately, this resource name "META-INF/spring.handlers" is hard-coded in org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.PluggableSchemaResolver and the stack calling this constructor from ClassPathXmlApplicationContext is extremely difficult (impossible?) to customize so as to change the default value.
Would it be possible to use another (additionnal) resource name than "META-INF/spring.handlers", for example "org/springframework/spring.handlers" ? A simple migration plan would be to search for both names, and simply concatenate results : no backward compatible problem, and no more problem with all these strange isolated ClassLoader such as osgi, Netbeans, JavaWebStart...
