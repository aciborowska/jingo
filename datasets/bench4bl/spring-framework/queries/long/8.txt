Context: 
Simple java app (not J2EE): IntelliJ IDEA plugin.
This app uses a third party container (propriatery not J2EE) that needs to be bridged into Spring. I use the strategy of creating a StaticApplicationContext to load all singletons created by the third party container and passing it as the parent of my own XML application context.
Problem:
I want to autowire all my beans. Some of my beans refer to beans defined in the StaticApplicationContext. Everything is fine if I use autowiring by name. However the autowiring by type does not work since it doesn't take into account the parent factory.
