When using remoting, especially rmi or ejb remoting, all classes will be serialized before sent over the wire. Unfortunately that does not work if client and server are using different versions of Spring jars and if there are some Spring classes involved.
 The problem is that Spring does not specify serialVersionUID for serializable classes. That is most critical for ApplicationEvent class and all the exceptions. So, I'd suggest to use serialVersionUID's from Spring 1.2.8 to all serializable classes and from now on always explicitly specify that value.
