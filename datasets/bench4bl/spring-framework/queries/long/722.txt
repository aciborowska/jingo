When I use lookup-method to get at a prototype that is a ApplicationListener, the listener instance isn't automatically added.  Actually, it may be the case no prototype listeners are added at all – and I think I've noted this before, now that I think about it.  In any case, this behaivior is confusing and inconsistent – why shouldn't prototypes be treated differently than singletons?
