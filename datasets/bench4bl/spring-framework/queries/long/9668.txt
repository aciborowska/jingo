our old methods with signature like:
 @RequestMapping(value = "/write-review", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public Object writeReview(.....
was successfully works with response:
 return "redirect:/some-url";
on old DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping/AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter
but after migration on RequestMappingHandlerMapping/RequestMappingHandlerAdapter this method was broken.
We fix it just rename return-type from Object to String.
But we waste a lot of time to find the problem. Will be great to fix it, or at least to document this behavior.
