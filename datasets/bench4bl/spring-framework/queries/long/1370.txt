I have a webapp configured for the path /redimo and a servlet-mapping in web.xml for the url-pattern '/*' to a DispatcherServlet
I use a SimpleUrlHandlerMapping to map the path '/' to a controller.
This causes the controller to be invoked when i access http://localhost:8080/redimo/
When I invoke the same url without a trailing slash (http://localhost:8080/redimo) , I'll get a 404 'the requested resource not available' error from the DispatcherServlet. This is because the request methods getContextPath() and getRequestURI() returns the same string, so UrlPathHelper.getPathWithinApplication() returns "" which can per definition never match a controller since SimpleUrlHandlerMapping always contains at least '/'.
When you have your spring application configured as the ROOT webapp at least tomcat solves this problem by redirecting http://localhost:8080 to http://localhost:8080/
