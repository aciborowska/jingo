postProcessPersistenceUnitInfo() is invoked before the PersistenceUnitInfo is fully constructed. My post processor (which is what drove this hook in the first place) needs access to the persistenceUnitRootUrl, which is set after the post processor is invoked. 
The call to the postProcessPersistenceUnitInfo should (please) be moved after the snippet:
    if (this.persistenceUnitInfo.getPersistenceUnitRootUrl() == null) 
{
        this.persistenceUnitInfo.setPersistenceUnitRootUrl(determinePersistenceUnitRootUrl());
    }
