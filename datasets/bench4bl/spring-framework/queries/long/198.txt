When connecting to an iSeries using the IBM DB2 drivers, the SQLErrorCodes object in SQLErrorCodesFactory is not detected as a version of DB2 and is set to null.
This appears to be because the version 6 drivers return "DB2 UDB for AS/400" on the dbmdInfo.get("DatabaseProductName") call (SQLErrorCodesFactory, line 190). The check on line 193 of the same file references responses beginning with "DB2/" as DB2 and thus ignores this response.
