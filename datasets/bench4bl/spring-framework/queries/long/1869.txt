When one item with one or more commas is selected from a multiple selection list box, e.g., "chorus, band, orchestra", an array of strings is returned, e.g., 
{"chorus", "band", "orchestra"}
.  The item with commas is preserved if several items are selected or if the form holds the items in List<String> rather than String [ ].
