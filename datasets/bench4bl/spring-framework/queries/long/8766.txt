Bean property 'statusCodes' is not writable or has an invalid setter method. Does the parameter type of the setter match the return type of the getter?
indeed :
public void setStatusCodes(Properties statusCodes)
Map<String, Integer> getStatusCodes()
Probably a regression due to SPR-8452. Works with 3.1.0.M2. Maybe works on jdk7 as Introspector was modified.
Why not make statusCodes a Map instead of Properties?
