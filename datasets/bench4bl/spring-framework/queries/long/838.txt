in certain cases i get this freemarker exception:
Expression spring is undefined on line 81, column 44 in spring.ftl. The problematic instruction: ---------- ==> assignment: stringStatusValue=spring.status.value?default("") [on line 81, column 17 in spring.ftl]  in user-directive spring.bind
In short, the case that is causing problems is:
my template main.ftl includes other templates, located in the subdirectory components. If main.ftl doesn't, but several of the components import spring.ftl, the error occurs.
Sadly, I don't have enough time to throw at this to track down the exact freemarker problem.
But regardless it highligts what seems to be an unnecessary and unwanted reference to the spring variable in spring.ftl.
From what I can see, spring.ftl doesn't assign or need the spring variable, and therefore shouldn't reference it.
In addition to the error I get, this reference unnecessarily forces users to assign spring.ftl to the spring variable/hash, doesn't it?
Am I missing something?
