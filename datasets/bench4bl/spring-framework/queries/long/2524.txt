Could be tough to make a unit test out of, but the gist of it is that, when using autowire=byType, I've been seeing that Spring will actually get very confused and do one or all of the following:

Create an instance of a singleton bean many times (for example - we've seen it create the Quartz bean 7 times, resulting in 70 threads spread across 7 thread pools)
Fail to initialize a bean, such as the iBatis integration bean, but then not report the problem in the logs and instead just continue along without wiring up the SqlClientMap

If I set autowire=no and then do it by hand for each bean, the problem goes away. Or, as I did in my case, I just rolled back to 2.0 M2 and everything was fine.
Rolling back to 2.0 M2 fixed the problem just fine, so there is something definitely up with the release.
