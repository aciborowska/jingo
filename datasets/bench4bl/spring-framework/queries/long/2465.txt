The pointcuts of AnnotationTransactionAspect match only the execution of public methods. This makes sense for the Spring AOP, but if you use AspectJ to get annotated transaction (mainly to get clean support for transactions/aspects in general on private/protected methods) this prevents an easy out-of-the-box usage of AnnotationTransactionAspect via AspectJ AOP.
