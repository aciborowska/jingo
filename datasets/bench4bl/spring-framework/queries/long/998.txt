The main ant build file for the PetClinic demo externalises the location of the spring.root making it relitivley simple to build a version of Petclinic outside of samples directory and the full Spring Source tree. 
However, the petclinic/db/build.xml which is called from the main setupDB task does not repect the spring.root and always assumes that the  HSQL or MySQL drivers will be found at the relative location of "../../../lib" to the /db directory which may not be the case if the sample has been cloned to a separate location.
