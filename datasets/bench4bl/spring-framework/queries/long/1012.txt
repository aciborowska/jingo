If you have multiple AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTests which have DIFFERENT configLocations and you run these as part of a single testsuite within Eclipse's junit pane then an arbitrary error and traceback are given. However each AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTests works ok when run on its own.
Furthermore, this is not just a problem with AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTests. Similar problems occur if you embed an ApplicationContext within a regular junit TestCase (although the problem is worse then, because even the same configLocations give errors, because the applicationcontext is not cached.)
Tests run fine when as part of junit ant task (note that this by default does some magic (which I don't understand) with the classloader between testcases/classes...)
