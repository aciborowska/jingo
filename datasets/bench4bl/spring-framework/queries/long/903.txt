It is common approach to use multiple xml config files. I often 
includes entities from one global file:
[..]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD BEAN//EN"
                   "http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd"
[
  <!ENTITY % entities SYSTEM "classpath:my/path/entities.ent" >
  %entities;
]>
[..]
It works fine with files which are included in `contextConfigLocation' servlet init param. 
Problem is when I file is not direct parsed by spring, here is example:
application-servlet.xml:
[..]
<bean id="xmlViewResolver" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.XmlViewResolver">
  <property name="order">
    <value>0</value>
  </property>
  <propertyname="location">
    <value>views.xml</value>
  </property>
</bean>
[..]
When views.xml has line like "<!ENTITY % entities SYSTEM "classpath:my/path/entities.ent" >" it do not parse.
Problem is that it (XmlViewResolver) uses BeansDtdResolver and classpath: prefix properly resolved by ResourceEntityResolver.
