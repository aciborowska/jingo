Class org.springframework.load.http.HttpTests does not compile in the Eclipse project that's currently in CVS. It seems to depend on a package called 'HTTPClient'; which could be this one: http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/ (not sure since there seem to be many HTTPClient packages floating around).
I can't immediately trace the problem in the history of .classpath. HttpTests.java hasn't been updated in recent months.
Is this class even used? Should it be kicked out?
