In UriComponentsBuilder, a regular expression QUERY_PARAM_PATTERN is used to split the query part of the URL into its separate query components. QUERY_PARAM_PATTERN is defined as:






	private static final Pattern QUERY_PARAM_PATTERN = Pattern.compile("([^&=]+)=?([^&=]+)?");






The last part of the regular expression dictates that the part after the first "=" is not allowed to contain further "=" signs. In other words, the query string
?query=title=Spring&operation=search
would be split up into three parts:

query=title
Spring
operation=search

This can be circumvented by URL encoding the "=" as %3D. However, in my case this all is being called from UriTemplate which RestTemplate's HttpUrlTemplate extends, and the UriTemplate constructor calls build() on the UrlComponentsBuilder which then URL encodes all the query parameter values, turning the %3D into %253D.
In the end, the easiest solution would be to change the regular expression for QUERY_PARAM_PATTERN to






([^&=]+)=?([^&]+)?
