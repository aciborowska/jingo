There are various design loose ends in poly expression support. - We need a IPolyExpression type that documents the APIs. - Disparate APIs need unification (Incovation.binding, RE.findCompile*,LE.getResolved* etc) - We need to come up with a FunctionTypeBinding that would be the typereturned by LE and RE resolve methods. There are a few more loose ends documented in other bugs, I'll scan throughthem and collect them all here so this can be the umbrella bug for thiseffort.
