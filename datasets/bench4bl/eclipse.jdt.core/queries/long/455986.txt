Run this code snippet:ASTParser parser = ASTParser.newParser(AST.JLS8);parser.setKind(ASTParser.K_STATEMENTS);parser.setSource("super();".toCharArray());ASTNode astNode = parser.createAST(null);The resulting astNode is a Block without any statements, but it should contain a SuperConstructorInvocation.I've looked into ASTParser code and around line 1350 it seems that constructorDeclaration is converted using only its statements field, but constructorCall field should be used as well.
