ICTB is used for two purposes in JDT/Core:1. To support the special intersection cast introduced for lambda serialization2. In type inference.While this abstraction serves the purposes for (1) fairly adequately[*], it isnot hooked up properly into various type compatibility APIs (isCompatibleWithisEquivalentTo, findSuperTypeOriginatingFrom etc) and as a result does notserve well the requirements of (2)For 1.7 we use a modified wildcard binding that serves as an intersectiontype. Either we should move all uses of ICTB to that or factor out theintersection type part of wildcard into a separate abstraction and startusing that. [*] Even there we have problems: See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=424410
