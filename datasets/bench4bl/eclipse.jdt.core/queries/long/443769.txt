Created attachment 246938Example project that shows problemIn projects with annotation processors, it is possible to get bogus error messages.Please try out the example project I have attached and see that there is an error message in Anno.java saying that A.X cannot be resolved to a variable. A.X is defined and you can even navigate to it using F3.Here's what I believe is happening:1. In the annotation processor there is a call to Elements#getElementValuesWithDefaults()2. This causes type resolution for A.X since A.X is the default value for the foo() attribute for Anno.java using the method org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ast.QualifiedNameReference.resolveType(BlockScope)3. The type resolution of A.X causes the 'RestrictiveFlags' part of the 'bits' field of the binding for A.X to change from Binding.VARIABLE to Binding.FIELD4. After the annotation processing the normal build begins.5. A.X is again resolved but since the 'RestrictiveFlags' part of the 'bits' field for the A.X binding is Binding.FIELD, it does not match any of the cases in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ast.QualifiedNameReference.resolveType(BlockScope) and so an error is reported.I don't really understand how the JDT compiler works so I haven't been able to find a fix for this issue.
