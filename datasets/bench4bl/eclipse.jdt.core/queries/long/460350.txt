In bug 442021, org.eclipse.equinox.common moved to 1.6, and the IAdaptable method got changed to: public  T  T getAdapter(Class T  adapter);Now, org.eclipse.compare, which is still at 1.4, has 5 Javadoc compile errors for references like this: * @see IAdaptable#getAdapter(Class)Error: Javadoc: Invalid referenceThis is a bug in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ast.Javadoc#resolveReference(..). I have a fix that I'll release shortly.
