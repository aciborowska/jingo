In https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/package-summary.html , the package description starts with: a name="package.description" In Java SE 7 and earlier, it was: a name="package_description" The effect is that package descriptions from attached Javadoc don't show up in Javadoc hovers.
