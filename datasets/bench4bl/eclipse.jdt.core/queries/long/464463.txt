Similar to bug 463330 but probably easier:When using DOMFinder on an ITypeParameter, DOMFinder.search() captures the source range, whereas visit(TypeParameter) matches against the name only. Ergo nothing is found.It seems the source range of an ITypeParameter is not very useful here, since it does not include any type arguments of type bounds, see, e.g.: T extends List String  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^whereas the range of the corresponding DOM element does include type arguments.At a first glance this should be fixable by capturing the name range (as it is already done for IMembers and IInitializers.
