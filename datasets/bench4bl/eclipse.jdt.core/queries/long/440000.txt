import java.util.function.*;public class Snippet { Function Integer, int[]  m1 = int[]::new;}In the above example, CreationReference#resolveMethodBinding() returns a synthetic method binding for the constructor of int[] i.e.   method binding: Snippet.lambda$0(int)The binding is "private static" and has "IS CONSTRUCTOR: false", hence it cannot be used to identify if the method is a constructor.The DOM APIs should not create a fake constructor binding for array types in CreationReference as it cannot tell anything interesting to the API clients.Instead, CreationReference#resolveMethodBinding() should return null if the type is an array type.
