Snippet: List String  test(String[] args) { return Arrays.asList(args); }Selecting "asList" gives an IMethod that represents the invocation "List String  asList(String[])", good.Passing this IMethod into ASTParser.createBinding() returns an IMethodBinding for "List T  asList(T[])", which looks wrong to me.This was detected as the root cause behind the difference discussed in bug 403917 comment 10 last para.Please let me know if it may have been a deliberate decision to ignore the parameterization.
