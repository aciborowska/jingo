masterCompilationUnit#findDeclaringNode(..) finds ExpressionMethodReference instead of MethodDeclarationSnippet:public class E1 { void foo(Object arg) { IntSupplier s1 = arg::hashCode; }}In the ASTView, show the ExpressionMethodReference for arg::hashCode. Double-clicking its child node "  method binding: Object.hashCode()" calls findDeclaringNode(..), and that API wrongly returns the enclosing ExpressionMethodReference, which consequently gets selected.findDeclaringNode(..) should return null in this case, since Object#hashCode() is not declared in the given AST.
