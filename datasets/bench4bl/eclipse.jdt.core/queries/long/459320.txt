Created attachment 250583Fix in old ImportRewriteAnalyzerFollow-up to bug 454914 comment 3.ImportRewrite adds an unused import for the declared package when pasting into a compilation unit that is outside of the project's classpath.Steps:- check out SWT from Git and set the project up for your platform (copy .classpath file)- open MenuItem#setToolTipText(String) from the classpath- copy doc line to clipboard: * {@link Shell#setMenuBar(Menu) shell menubar} on Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu Unity desktop.- Open Resource..., open a MenuItem.java that is not on classpath- set caret to first line of class Javadoc- Paste=  bad import added:import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;The attached fix is for the old ImportRewriteAnalyzer (before bug 430303). I still had this in my workspace and need to save it somewhere. Didn't release since it would conflict with bug 430303, and I guess it's better to get that one done first.
