https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=437444 introducesinterned captures:This still needs follow up in three areas: - To make it more robust we should capture using both the capturingexpression's source start and source end (along with CUD) not just thesource end as some times source ends are seen to be identical for thecontaining and the contained expression (cast, assignment ...) - TypeSystem.getCapturedWildcard may introduce performance problems as wejust maintain a linear list of captures across all files input to compiler.These should be hashed somehow on a CUD basis. - We need to see whether we need ATS.getCapturedWildcard and what itwould look like.
