Missing nullness information for the JRE can be attached using external annotations (see bug 331651), but for some methods, we still don't have a place to put annotations, because those methods are never declared in any source.Examples are the values() / valueOf() pair of methods generated into each enum type. Given we statically know the contract of those methods, the compiler should implicitly know about their nullness, too.Basically, all kinds of SyntheticMethodBinding are candidates, to be scanned which ones can actually impact null analysis.
