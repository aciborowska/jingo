Created attachment 246267Code triggering the bug.The synthetic $deserializeLambda$ method may be generated before the synthetic methods for nested lambdas. When this happens the $deserializeLambda$ only handles the lambdas that have already been encountered but is missing subsequent lambdas.For example, with the attached source code, only two of the three lambdas are handled in $deserializeLambda$.The code in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ClassFile already hints at this issue with the todo:// TODO [andy] do we need to do this after the loop to ensure it is done last?The synthesis loop should be restructured to ensure the $deserializeLambda$ method is produced only after all the nested lambdas have been discovered.
