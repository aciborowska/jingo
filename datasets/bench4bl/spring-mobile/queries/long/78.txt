Hi there,
I saw this issue:
https://jira.springsource.org/browse/MOBILE-70
which is marked as fixed, but I can still reproduce it even in Spring Mobile version 1.1.0.M3.
Here's the steps that I take:
1) My Controller looks like this 






    @RequestMapping(value = "/test", method = RequestMethod.GET)




    public String home(final HttpServletRequest request) {




        return "redirect:/home";




    }






2) I visit the page: http://localhost:8080/test and I get redirected to http://localhost:8080/normal//home which is not there!
3) This works perfectly fine if I use ModelAndView. However, I want to get rid of the ModelAndView because I can't use the RedirectAttributes which are part of Spring 3.2
I will attach a sample project soon.
Thanks for your help.
