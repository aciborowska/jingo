When sharing a link/picture, a 400 error results. Per the OP in the forum, it appears to have something to do with unexpected CDATA (XML?). 
Initial theory is that the LinkedIn API is expecting XML, but we are sending JSON. The JSON sent is the "unexpected CDATA". But why did it once work and now doesn't?
