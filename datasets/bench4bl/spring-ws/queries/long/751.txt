This can also be an improvement, but different from what the user expects as Jaxb2Marshaller is correctly configured.
class A {
  @XmlAnyElement(lax = true)
  protected Object any;
}
// B is any
@XmlRootElement
class B {
}
Jaxb2Marshaller.classesToBeBound = 
{A, B}

If I create an object A with A.any=B, AbstractJaxb2PayloadMethodProcessor.getJaxbContext creates a JAXBContext which only sees A, and not B, so marshalling fails.
The solution
@XmlSeeAlso(B.class)
class A {
}
is not elegant. Is there a better way to set the local context to work with any elements?
