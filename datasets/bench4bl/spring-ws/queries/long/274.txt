This bug is related to: http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SWS-244.  If white space appears in the header then a class cast exception is thrown.   Sun's SAAJ impl returns these whitespace nodes as TextImpl.  The class cast happens when the TextImpl's are cast as SOAPHeaderElement.  I've verified that this is a problem with Spring WS 1.0.3 as well even though I'm currently using 1.0.2.
org.springframework.ws.soap.saaj.SaajSoapHeader
        public Object next() 
{
            SOAPHeaderElement saajHeaderElement = (SOAPHeaderElement) iterator.next();   <-- class cast happens here.
            return new SaajSoapHeaderElement(saajHeaderElement);
        }
