AbstractAddressingEndpointMapping adds all SmartEndpointInterceptors to its SoapEndpointInvocationChain without calling shouldIntercept() on each instance.  Contract this to AbstractEndpointMapping which does call shouldIntercept() on each interceptor and only adds ones that return true to its chain.
AbstractAddressingEndpointMapping should be enhanced to invoke shouldIntercept and only add the necessary SmartEndpointInterceptors to its SoapEndpointInvocationChain.
