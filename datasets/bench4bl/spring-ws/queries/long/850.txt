Most HTTP level exceptions, such as XML parsing issues, can be handled by writing a custom WebServiceMessageHandlerAdapter that converts them to, for example, SOAP faults. However, NoEndpointFoundException is swallowed by WebServiceMessageReceiverObjectSupport class so that it is not thrown:
        catch (NoEndpointFoundException ex) {
            if (connection instanceof EndpointAwareWebServiceConnection) 
{
                ((EndpointAwareWebServiceConnection) connection).endpointNotFound();
            }
        }
this is in final method handleConnection(), so it cannot be overridden either. Instead, a handle adapter must re-implement this whole method if NoEndpointFoundException is wanted to be converted to SOAP Fault. Either the exception should be re-thrown or there needs to be an extension point.
