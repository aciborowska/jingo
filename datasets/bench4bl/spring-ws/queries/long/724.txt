The allowance for a blank ("") suffix is esential to be able to maintain compatability w/ legacy or handwritten WSDLs.
should read as:
    /** Sets the suffix to append to the port type name to obtain the binding name. */
    public void setBindingSuffix(String bindingSuffix) 
{
        Assert.notNull(bindingSuffix, "'bindingSuffix' must not be null");
        this.bindingSuffix = bindingSuffix;
    }

currently as:
  public void setBindingSuffix(String bindingSuffix)
  {
    Assert.hasText(bindingSuffix, "'bindingSuffix' must not be null");
    this.bindingSuffix = bindingSuffix;
  }
