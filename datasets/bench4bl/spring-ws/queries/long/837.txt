In the same bean definition for the embedded http server the line
<property name="defaultEndpoint" ref="stockEndpoint"
is missing a /> at the end.
While you're updating it you may as well change the endpoint mapping in the example from the deprecated PayloadRootQNameEndpointMapping to PayloadRootAnnotationMethodEndpointMapping
This deprecated mapping also appears in the other bean context examples.
