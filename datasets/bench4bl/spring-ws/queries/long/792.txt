I am looking for a help rather than issue.
I need to retrieve the SOAP Header info and don't know the way to do it.
I used the code below
SaajSoapMessage msg = (SaajSoapMessage) msgContext.getRequest();
SoapEnvelope envelope = msg.getEnvelope();
SoapHeader header = envelope.getHeader();
Iterator<SoapHeaderElement> iter = header.examineAllHeaderElements();
but iterator will ultimately give me weblogic.xml.saaj.TextImpl object which is not public in the package.
Please help.
Thanks,
Arvind.
