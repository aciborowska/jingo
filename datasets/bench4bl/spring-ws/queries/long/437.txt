XStreamMarshaller consistently accesses to the XStream instance via getters. However the method addOmittedFields() contains the direct access to the XStream instance.
Original code:
    public void addOmittedField(Class type, String fieldName) 
{
        xstream.omitField(type, fieldName);
    }

This is inconsistent with the rest of the code in the class and prevents the subclasses of XStreamMarshaller to provide their own implementation of XStream.
