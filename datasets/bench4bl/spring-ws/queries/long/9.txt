javax.xml.transform.Transformer is not thread safe: hence for each request, a separate instance must be created.
Throughout spring-ws-core, a number of Transformers are created (mostly in afterPropertiesSet()), and used. Instead, we must create a TransformerFactory, and a new Transformer per request.
