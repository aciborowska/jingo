The CastorMarshaller uses a stream to read the mapping file and than caches it in a field. Accoording to this issue on the castor site http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/CASTOR-1492 and this is not the way to do this. Please change the implementation of the CastorMarshaller to used the described caching technique.
