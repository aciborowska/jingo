The class name used by the DefaultMethodEndpointAdapter to detect whether JDOM is on classpath wasn't updated to reflect the upgrade to JDOM2. This breaks the use of JDOM2 Elements for endpoint mapping. A workaround is to add the class org.jdom.Element to the classpath---either by adding the old JDOM dependency, or by just creating an empty class of that name.
