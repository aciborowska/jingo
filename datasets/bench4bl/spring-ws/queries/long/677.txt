The '/META-INF/spring.schemas' in spring-ws-core (and possibly other jars) needs a reference to the v2 schema files:
Current:

http\://www.springframework.org/schema/web-services/web-services-1.5.xsd=/org/springframework/ws/config/web-services-1.5.xsd
I tried successfully:

http\://www.springframework.org/schema/web-services/web-services-1.5.xsd=/org/springframework/ws/config/web-services-1.5.xsd
http\://www.springframework.org/schema/web-services/web-services-2.0.xsd=/org/springframework/ws/config/web-services-2.0.xsd
http\://www.springframework.org/schema/web-services/web-services.xsd=/org/springframework/ws/config/web-services-2.0.xsd
YMMV
