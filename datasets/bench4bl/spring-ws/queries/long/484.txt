The packages exported by the the spring-ws v1.5.6 modules do not contain the version qualifier so the osgi framework recognizes their version as "0.0.0". This caused the import-package for the oxm packages in the spring-integration bundles to fail because they are looking for version range [1.5.5.A,2.0.0).
