As a result of SWS-798, when JMS messages are received, headers are no longer returned (from JmsTransportUtils.headerToJmsProperty) unless they are either contained in the CONVERSION_TABLE array, or prefixed with "SOAPJMS_".
This seems overly restrictive and prevents spring-ws being used to call 3rd party services, where we have no control over the MQ headers being sent.
Is the SOAPJMS_restriction necessary?
