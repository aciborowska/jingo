Symptom: Setting the property 'bspCompliant' on Wss4jSecurityInterceptor to false has an effect only for the first web service request after application start. Setting 'wsiBspCompliant=false' on the wssConfig object has the same result.
Cause: WSS4J sets back the value in WssConfig to true in each WSHandler.doSenderAction() call. WSHandler.doSenderAction() asks the Spring Wss4JHandler for the value of the configuration option IS_BSP_COMPLIANT in the set of options, and Wss4JHandler returns null. The default behaviour of WSS4J is: If an option is not set in the handler, the value defaults to true.
Possible correction: add IS_BSP_COMPLIANT to the set of options in Wss4JHandler on call to Wss4jSecurityInterceptor.setBspCompliant().
