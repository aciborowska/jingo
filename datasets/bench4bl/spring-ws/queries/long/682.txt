I've added my own ExceptionResolver as a bean in the applicationcontext by registering it as a bean. When an exception occurs, the code at MessageDispatcher.processEndpointException walks over the exception resolvers. When I debug, i see that they are in the following order: SimpleSoapExceptionResolver, SoapFaultAnnotationExceptionResolver, my resolver. This means that the SimpleSoapExceptionResolver will always handle all exceptions. I expect the order here to be reversed, so I can handle exceptions easily using my own exceptionResolver, as the documentation states.
