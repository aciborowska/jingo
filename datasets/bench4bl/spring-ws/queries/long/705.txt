I'm using an OSGi bundle from the Springsource Enterprise Bundle Repository, org.springframework.ws.soap.security_2.0.0.RELEASE . This bundle imports the package org.springframework.security.authentication at version="[2.0.0,3.0.0)" (to clarify, this means greater than or equal to 2.0.0 and less than 3.0.0). This same import information still seems to be in the Spring WS trunk. The org.springframework.security.authentication package is provided by Spring Security Core, but that package doesn't seem to exist in versions of Spring Securtiy Core prior to 3.0.0. This is causing org.springframework.ws.soap.security to be unable to resolve its dependency on Spring Security Core.
