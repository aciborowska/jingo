During a SOAP call, in case a ClientInterceptor returns false (meaning it did not manage to do its job), the call is not rejected. The WebServiceTemplate class iterates through the ClientInterceptors, and if one returns false, it simply stops calling the next interceptors, but executes the SOAP call itself.
In my opinion this can lead to a security hole. If the WSS interceptor does not manage to encrypt the message body, the call is not rejected, but sensitive data goes to the wire.
