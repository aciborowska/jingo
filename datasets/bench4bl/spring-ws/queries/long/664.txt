Working through the tutorial, section 3.7 "Publishing the WSDL" 
<quote>
We use a a relative URI and we instruct the framework to transform it dynamically to an absolute URI.

I have found out by trial and error that this only works if the following is set in web.xml
  <init-param>
    <param-name>transformWsdlLocations</param-name>
    <param-value>true</param-value>
  </init-param>
However, this is only mentioned in section 5.3.1.1 later on in the documentation.
