I'm using WebLogic for running Spring-WS.
When responce of the service is quite long (in my case around 100 kb) WL is not using "Content-Length" http header.
In this case on client side getResponseContentLength method will return -1.
As a result AbstractHttpSendingWebServiceConnection.hasRespons e()==false.
Finally returned value of service call is null.
The same service call is working fine if the result is smaller (~5 kb).
Seems to be client should not ignore the content of http responce just because of missing "Content-Length" value in the header.
