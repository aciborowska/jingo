Maven 3 seems to resolve build extension from pluginRepositories so org.springframework.build.aws.maven can not be resolved. spring-release needs to be added as pluginRepository in spring-ws-parent pom.xml. Attached spring-ws-parent_pom.xml.patch fixes this.
JIRA component "Build" would be more suitable for issues of this type, but it doesn't seem to be defined for SWS JIRA project.
