In the (otherwise excellent) tutorial, in the port type, the soap:address is
<soap:address location="http://mycompany.com/humanresources" /> 
Later on when setting up the MessageDispatcher, you're mentioning that 'We could have made the servlet more restrictive by using the url pattern /holidayService, but this will suffice for now.' To be precise (and clear) this should be changed to 'humanresources'. And add a reference to the port type.
