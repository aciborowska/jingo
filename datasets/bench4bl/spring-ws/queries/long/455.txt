Using AxiomSoapMessageFactory and with an endpoint extending AbstractStaxStreamPayloadEndpoint, special character predefined entities like & or < in HTTP response get 'mangled'.  For example, when the endpoint writes  <echo:echoRequest> < </echo:echoRequest> to the XMLStreamWriter (which is correct) what actually gets sent in the resulting AxiomSoapMessage is this: <echo:echoRequest> &<; </echo:echoRequest> (which is incorrect).  I recreated this bug with the echo sample application in 1.5.5 by changing the endpoint to extend AbstractStaxStreamPayloadEndpoint and specifying the AxiomSoapMessageFactory  in the spring-ws-servlet.xml file (documented in this forum thread: http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?p=215668)
I was able to correct this behavior by modifying org.springframework.ws.soap.axiom.AxiomHandler - I simply commented out the statements inside startEntity(..) and endEntity(..) functions making them "unsupported".  While this did not produce any side-effects during the testing I did for my project, I have not run the full spring-ws test suite.  The change is as follows:
class AxiomHandler implements ContentHandler, LexicalHandler {
...
 public void startEntity(String name) throws SAXException 
{
        //make unsupported to fix mangling of special character entities        
        //charactersType = XMLStreamConstants.ENTITY_REFERENCE;
    }

    public void endEntity(String name) throws SAXException 
{
        //make unsupported to fix mangling of special character entities
        //charactersType = XMLStreamConstants.CHARACTERS;
    }

...
}
