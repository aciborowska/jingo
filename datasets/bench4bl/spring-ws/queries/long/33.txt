The class org.springframework.oxm.castor.CastorMarshaller is unable to unmarshal XML to Java unless a mapping file is used.  Typically a mapping file is NOT used with Castor when using Castor-generated Java classes (generated from an XML schema).
The method org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller.unmarshal(Class clazz) should be used when the class type is specified.
