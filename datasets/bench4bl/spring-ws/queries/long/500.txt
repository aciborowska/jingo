When running mvn site on my project, the build hang on the following lines:
[INFO] Generating "Dependencies" report.
[WARNING] The repository url 'http://s3.amazonaws.com/maven.springframework.org/external' is invalid - Repository 'spring-external' will be blacklisted.
[WARNING] The repository url 'http://s3.amazonaws.com/maven.springframework.org/release' is invalid - Repository 'spring-release' will be blacklisted.
Doing a grep on my .m2 directory there was only file containing these repository urls:
~/.m2$ grep -r 'amazonaws' *
repository/org/springframework/ws/spring-ws-parent/1.5.5/spring-ws-parent-1.5.5.pom:            <url>http://s3.amazonaws.com/maven.springframework.org/release</url>
repository/org/springframework/ws/spring-ws-parent/1.5.5/spring-ws-parent-1.5.5.pom:            <url>http://s3.amazonaws.com/maven.springframework.org/external</url>
I think these are outdated and should be removed.or at least replaced by something that works.
