As of revision 1414 of  CommonsHttpMessageSender, the MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager never gets it's shutdown method invoked.
It appears that the prior revision of CommonsHttpMessageSender implemented DisposableBean, and invoked this properly.
SWS-482 removed the destroy method to cope with a problem report, but the result is worse.
If you use MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager, you have to call it's shutdown method, or it will block application exit.
For example, I have a class with a main method that uses WebServiceTemplate along with CommonsHttpMessageSender that is invoked via an ant task. The main method will complete, but the JVM cannot exit.
Lets revisit SWS-482 and come up with a means for resolving the issue appropriately.
The reporter of that issue mentions that:
"it happens it is always after we redeploy our application (weblogic 9.2MP2)".
