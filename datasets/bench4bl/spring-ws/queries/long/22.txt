When the method setValidation(boolean) of JaxbMarshaller is called it always throws an UnsupportedOperationException, due the fact that the JAXB has deprecated the similar method of java.xml.bind.Unmarshaller and the Sun's JAXB implementation throws that exception.
The problem is that the setValidation(boolean) method of JaxbMarshaller is being called in afterPropertiesSer() method, so the JaxbMarshaller cannot be instatiated by spring.
