The tutorial http://static.springframework.org/spring-ws/site/reference/html/tutorial.html is a total show-stopper for the new users. There are many mistakes some of which are listed below:-
1. The example of POM has wrong end tag for </dependencies> 
2. activation.jar is needed for the tutorial to work. Hence the following code should be added to pom.xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.activation</groupId>
    <artifactId>activation</artifactId>
    <version>1.1</version>
</dependency> 
3. The tutorial should be perfect and simple. We should try to make it simpler with minimal features and calculations. I still feel we should put more effort in this. 
PS: I have never got the tutorial to work!!
