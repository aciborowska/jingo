The AbstractAnnotationMethodEndpointMapping looks up annotated method endpoints in the BeanPostProcessor::postProcessBeforeInitialization method. It then holds a reference to the bean inside of a "MethodEndpoint" instance.
The problem is that proxies get created AFTER the postProcessBeforeInitialization method. The lifecycle goes...
BeanPostProcessor::postProcessBeforeInitialization
AbstractAutoProxyCreator::createProxy
BeanPostProcessor::postProcessAfterInitialization
The AbstractAnnotationMethodEndpointMapping should implement postProcessAfterInitialization, not postProcessBeforeInitialization
