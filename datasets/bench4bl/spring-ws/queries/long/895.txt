AxiomHandler must cleanup the prefix mapping created in startPrefixMapping(..).
endPrefixMapping(..) should remove the mapped prefix to avoid later siblings getting previous siblings namespace definitions.
In worst case if the later sibling doesn't define any namespaces (when covered by the parent element) it would get namespace definitions for the previous sibling.
