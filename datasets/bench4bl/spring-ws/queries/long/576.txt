In org.springframework.ws.server.MessageDispatcher class sentMessageTracingLogger with trace level does not log the same request message as the one being logged by receivedMessageTracingLogger.
I've noticed that request message having <SOAP-ENV:Header> with wss4j stuff is properly logged by receivedMessageTracingLogger on trace level:






Received request [<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">




<SOAP-ENV:Header>




<wsse:Security xmlns:wsse="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd" SOAP-ENV:mustUnderstand="1">




<wsse:UsernameToken xmlns:wsu="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd" wsu:Id="UsernameToken-21398464">




<wsse:Username>876543</wsse:Username>




<wsse:Password Type="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-username-token-profile-1.0#PasswordText">a701050a4e03ef54319c319c9a06a895</wsse:Password>




</wsse:UsernameToken>




</wsse:Security>




</SOAP-ENV:Header>




<SOAP-ENV:Body>....</SOAP-ENV:Body></SOAP-ENV:Envelope>] 






Unfortunately sentMessageTracingLogger strips out content of <SOAP-ENV:Header> when logging request message:






Sent response [------=_Part_18_463346590.1255441172093




Content-Type: application/xop+xml; type="text/xml"; charset=utf-8




Â 




<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">




<SOAP-ENV:Header/>




<SOAP-ENV:Body>...</SOAP-ENV:Body></SOAP-ENV:Envelope>




------=_Part_18_463346590.1255441172093--] for request [<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"><SOAP-ENV:Header>




</SOAP-ENV:Header><SOAP-ENV:Body>...</SOAP-ENV:Body></SOAP-ENV:Envelope>






It seems that wss4j headers are processed by WSS4j Interceptor and then somehow removed from requestMessage. Actually had no time to dig it further and check if custom headres are also stripped out.
Anyway i think that sentMessageTracingLogger  should log original client request message.
I am attaching patch version of MessageDispatcher
