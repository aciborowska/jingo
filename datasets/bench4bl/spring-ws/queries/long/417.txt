Currently, despite all Spring WS JARs being OSGi bundles, you can't use classes from spring-ws-core-tiger in an OSGi container.  This is due to spring-ws-core-tiger exporting packages that are already exported by spring-ws-core.
The easiest fix for this would be to change spring-ws-core-tiger to a fragment bundle, with its host bundle set to spring-ws-core.  This can be fixed by adding the following manifest entry to spring-ws-core-tiger.
Fragment-Host: org.springframework.bundle.ws.core;version="[1.5.4, 1.5.4]"
I have not checked if the oxm/oxm-tiger JARs have a similar issue.
