I have a document like this:






{"_id": ..., "like_count":23, "name": "...", ...}






As the documentation explains: If your property names contain underscores (e.g. first_name) you can escape the underscore in the method name with a second underscore. For a first_name property the query method would have to be named findByFirstname(â€¦). I do the same approach in order to get the data using MongoRepository with the following action:






public interface BlogRepository extends MongoRepository<Blog, String>{




...




Long countByLike__count(int favoriteCount);




}






But, I receive No property like found for type Blog!
On the other hand, this method with Query annotation works as expected:






public interface BlogRepository extends MongoRepository<Blog, String>{




...




    @Query(value = "{like_count : ?0}", count = true)




    Long countByLikes(int count);




}






What am I doing wrong?
PS: I tried both spring-data-mongodb:1.8.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT and spring-data-mongodb:1.7.0.RELEASE
