Problem:
spring-data-mongodb does not work in an OSGi server because of two unresolved dependencies. These do not have OSGi-aware jars and are not set as optional: 

com.mysema.query
org.apache.commons.collections15

Details:
QueryDslMongoRepository depends on: org.apache.commons.collections15 && com.mysema.query. Assuming both are optional (based on the fact that com.mysema.querydsl is set as an "optional" dependency in the pom.xml), the MANIFEST.MF must have ";resolution:=optional" for both as well. Otherwise, when run in an OSGi container (SpringDM Server / Virgo 2.2.1), these dependencies are explicitly required at start-up. 
Since both "com.mysema & collections15" do not have jars with OSGi-compatible manifests, there is no way to run this bundle in an OSGi container.
Possible solution are to: (a) not depend on colleciton15 & mysema, (b) make the resolution of these optional (which implies that QueryDslMongoRepository will either never be used in an OSGi container, or these bundles will need to be maintained in the Spring Bundle Repository).
