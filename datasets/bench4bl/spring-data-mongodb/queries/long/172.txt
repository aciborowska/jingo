I have a Location object that I need to force the order of the properties when they get persisted to mongodb so that I can set a GeoSpatialIndex on the field.  In order to use the GeoSpatialIndex, the first two properties must be numbers (lat/lon).  In my case, I have the following object:
Location {
   float lat;
   float lon;
   County county;
}
When the Location object is persisted in mongodb, it puts the properties in alphabetical order.  So I tried adding:
@XmlRootElement(name="location")
@XmlType(propOrder=
{"latitude", "longitude", "county"}
)
but this doesn't work either. I was asked to enter a JIRA for the issue.  
I'm about to try to use a custom Converter which I assume is a workaround to the issue (I hope).  It would be very nice if using the annotation (or a different one) would work though.  It would be much more simple. 
If the workaround doesn't work and there isn't another work around, this is a very major issue because I can't create a geospatial index the way it works.
