It looks like the eb7c0fe1dd00ea8792b27d5191e9cb7714b92551 commit to prepare the 1.1.x branch missed changing the root-level pom version from 1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT to 1.1.2.BUILD-SNAPSHOT. Additionally, I can't build that branch locally because that same commit upgraded data.commons.version from 1.4.0.RELEASE to 1.4.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT, but the snapshot cannot be found in the repo; does a manual build of that project have to be kicked off?
Lastly, just a question: will the releases of spring-data-mongodb be tied to releases of spring-data-commons? I was surprised to see the mongo 1.1.x branch dependent on the 1.4.x snapshot of commons.
