I'm trying to have two pulAll in one update but it seems that it doesn't add element to the list but override the last one added






Update update = new Update();




update.pullAll("field1", anArray);




update.pullAll("field2", anOtherArray);







if I check the content:






update.getUpdateObject();




"$pullAll" -> " size = 1"







and the value is field2
