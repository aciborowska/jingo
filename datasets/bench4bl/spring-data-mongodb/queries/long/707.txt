The following query hangs forever for some objectIds in our database. This works perfectly in 1.2.0, but not in 1.2.1.  It does not occur for all database objects, but it does for some.
Query query = new Query(new Criteria("_id").is(new ObjectId(objectId)));
mongoTemplate.findOne(query, InstanceType.class, COLLECTION_NAME)
