Looking at the JMX implementation of ServerInfo, it looks like the "server host name" bean returns the hostname of the spring server and not the hostname of the mongodb server.






@ManagedOperation(description = "Server host name")




public String getHostName() throws UnknownHostException {




  return InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName();




}






All other operations use getServerStatus() properly (which seems to contact the database).
