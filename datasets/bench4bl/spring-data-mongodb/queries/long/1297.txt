I'm not able to uniquely index a property if it's a reference.
For example: 






 




@DBRef




@Indexed(unique = true) // This does not work because of @DBRef




private User user1;




 




@Indexed(unique = true) // This works fine




private User user1;












I know that it's possible to unique index a DBRef, so I'm not sure why this doesn't work. It seems like a pretty important piece of functionality.
