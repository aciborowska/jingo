This i observed while working on spring mongodb framework.
org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.geo.Point class' toString() method renders x as latitude and y as longitude.






public String toString() {




  return String.format("Point [latitude=%f, longitude=%f]", x, y);




}






But actually these should be reversed. As mongodb near query expects point as (longitude,latitude). The behavior while query construction is same where it constructs the near query coordinate as (x,y) but toString() method mention it reversely,
This should be corrected to avoid confusion, which took some time for me to realize.
