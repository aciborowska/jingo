When I run Spring Data MongoDB 1.2.1, I found the code throwing following exception stack:






Caused by: org.springframework.beans.PropertyBatchUpdateException: Failed properties: Property 'mongoOperations' threw exception; nested exception is java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.support.MongoRepositoryFactoryBean.setMappingContext(Lorg/springframework/data/mapping/context/MappingContext;)V






Detail stack trace is attached.
After analyzing the code: org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.support.MongoRepositoryFactoryBean, setMongoOperations(…) references to setMappingContext(…) which does not exist in the same class or super class which is causing the problem.
This has stopped me to work further in the project. Please fix it asap. This is a code review bug.
