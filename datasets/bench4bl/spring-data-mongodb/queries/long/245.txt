The fix for DATAMONGO-235 got rid of the Exception, but the mapping doesn't actually work properly.  I've created a test below which is now failing. Essentially, Objects within a List which was in a Map are mapped to empty {{Object}}s, rather than {{Map}}s. Here's a failing test:






 




@Test




public void readsMapListNestedValuesCorrectly() {




 




	BasicDBList list = new BasicDBList();




	BasicDBObject nested = new BasicDBObject();




	nested.append("Hello", "World");




	list.add(nested);




	DBObject source = new BasicDBObject("mapOfObjects", new BasicDBObject("Foo", list));




 




	ClassWithMapProperty result = converter.read(ClassWithMapProperty.class, source);




	Object firstObjectInFoo = ((List)result.mapOfObjects.get("Foo")).get(0);




	assertThat(firstObjectInFoo, is(instanceOf(Map.class)));




	assertThat((String)((Map)firstObjectInFoo).get("Hello"), is(equalTo("World")));




}
