I basically created an interface that contains a query method that looks something like this:






List<Status> findByStatusNot(String status);






When I tired to use this method spring-mongo threw: 






InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException: "Invalid query: 'not' can't be used with 'is' - use 'ne' instead."






From the looks of it there seems to be a bug in the MongoQueryCreator class which does the following for NEGATING_SIMPLE_PROPERTY case:






criteria.not().is(parameters.nextConverted(property));






Note that criteria.is() explicitly throws an exception if a call to not() proceeds it.
