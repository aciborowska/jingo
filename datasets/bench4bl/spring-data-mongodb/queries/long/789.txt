MongoDB allows to have users to be defined in the 'admin' database that have permissions in other databases. See last example in http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/add-user-to-database/. Before MongoDB 2.4, a login was automatically checked both in the database you connected to and in the 'admin' database. Since MongoDB 2.4, you need to explicitly mention the authentication database when logging in via the tools.
If you connect via the Driver, you need to first connect to the 'admin' database to authenticate, and then switch to the database of your choice.
This option is missing from the Spring-Data-MongoDB integration module.

The use of users in the admin database was enforced by our MongoDB consultants.
