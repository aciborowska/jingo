I'd like to implement lazy schema migration using AbstractMongoEventListener that transforms old documents into new schema before mapping. It works as long as the documents are loaded directly. But when documents are loaded  via DBRef then AbstractMongoEventListener#onAfterLoad.
The guy here (http://forum.spring.io/forum/spring-projects/data/130328-mongoeventlistener-onafterload-and-dbref ) describes the same problem with more detailed example.
