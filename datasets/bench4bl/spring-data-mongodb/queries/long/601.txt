When the provided password and / or user is wrong we receive the following exception:






Error creating bean with name 'sameCoolClassRepository': FactoryBean threw exception on object creation; nested exception is org.springframework.data.mongodb.CannotGetMongoDbConnectionException:




Failed to authenticate to database [mydbname], username = [myusername], password = [thecleartextpassword]






Spring Data should never print the password in the logiles.
Suggested solution: print first and last letter: 'mysecret' gets 'm**************t'
