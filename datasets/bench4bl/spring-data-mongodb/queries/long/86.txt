1. Create a class with containing a List of Objects.
2. Store it to the database
3. Load it from the database
4. try to add another element to the list
-> java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException

the implementation of the List is a java.util.Arrays.ArrayList (inner class of Arrays)
this list inherits from AbstractList and only overrides some Methods
the other Methods are stubbed and throw an UnsupportedOperationException
probably Arrays.asList() has been used to convert the JSon array to a List.


solution: do not use Arrays.asList()
