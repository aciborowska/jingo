We are using the latest 1.5.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT and when trying to use the new field naming strategy xml configuration from DATAMONGO-866 like so:
 <mongo:mapping-converter field-naming-strategy-ref="namingStrategy" />
We are getting rejected by the MappingMongoConverterParser check for using both abbreviate-field-names and field-naming-strategy-ref.
This seems to happen when the abbreviate-field-names attribute is read and because we haven't set it - it defaults to what is defined in the schema which is "false" and because we have set field-naming-strategy-ref we get the "Only one of the attributes abbreviate-field-names and field-naming-strategy-ref can be configured!" error.
We have worked around this by setting the abbreviate-field-names attribute to "", like so:
 <mongo:mapping-converter field-naming-strategy-ref="namingStrategy" abbreviate-field-names="" />
