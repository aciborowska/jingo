It seems that there is a bug in lMappingMongoConverter.java:1029. The logic assumes that variable typeHint is of Map type (by calling getMapValueType method). 
Unfortunately the typeInformation object passed by the delegateConvertToMongoType method of the QueryMapper class is resolved by getTypeInformation method which for a Map type returns the values' (V) type not the whole Map type. 
This makes the the method call getMapValueType for a typeHint which is not a Map. Going further when such situation happens there is probably a bug in spring-data-commons which results in a StackOverflowError (I reported it here: DATACMNS-899).
