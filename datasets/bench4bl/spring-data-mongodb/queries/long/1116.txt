Performance of java bean conversion to DBObject is terribly slow even for simple objects. For instance, in my test, conversion of very simple object of class:






class Foo { long id; String payload; ... } 






to DBObject takes about 8us.
I've written a self-contained perftest, have a look:

Results on my machine are:
auto: 8000ns
hand: 110ns
Conversion back is also too slow (but not terribly).
Peformance of conversion becomes a bottleneck in our application, and we even had to write conversions manually in several places.
We are using:
spring-data-mongodb-1.5.0
spring-data-commons-1.8.0
spring-core-4.0.7
