I'm initializing mongo with a spring xml. I'm using propertyPlaceHolderConfigurer to inject parameters that are coming from jndi.
I can configure my application with a replicatset or not (a simple host). 
The only workaround to distinct the two cases is to inject a empty string for replicaset when i'm using a simple host. But MongoFactoryBean should ignore this property in this case.
