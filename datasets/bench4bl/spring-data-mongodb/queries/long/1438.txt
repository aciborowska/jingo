When I start my Spring Boot 1.3.5 application with no custom conversions and with Spring Data MongoDB Release Train Hopper-SR1 I get following warning in my logs:






Registering converter from class java.lang.Number to class java.lang.Number as writing converter although it doesn't convert to a Mongo supported type! You might wanna check you annotation setup at the converter implementation.







With the in Spring Boot 1.3.5 integrated version the warning is not exists..
I have alle my Domain classes they are saved in MongoDB annotated with @Document (see DATAMONGO-1413)
