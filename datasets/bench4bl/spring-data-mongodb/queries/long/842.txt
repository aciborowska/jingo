The sentence:
"You can no get the template injected and perform storing and retrieving operations to it."
should read
"You can now get the template injected and perform storing and retrieving operations to it."
I would recommend rewording this sentence as it doesn't scan that well. For example:
"The template can now be injected and used to perform storage and retrieval operations".
