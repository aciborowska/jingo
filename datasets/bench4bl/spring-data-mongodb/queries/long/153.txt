I have a Parent with Children.  Each child maintains a reference to its parent.
Issues show up when:
1) I have a @DBRef referencing the parent in the child class
   Removing this @DBRef solves the issue
2) take Example of Country and State
@Document(collection = "country")
public class Country {
 @DBRef(collection="state")
  private List<State> states = new ArrayList<State>();
@Document(collection = "state")
public class State {
 //@DBRef
 private Country country;
Then...
   Country countryInDB = get(mongoOperation, "country", "name", ctry,Country.class);
   State stateInDB = get(mongoOperation, "state", "name", state, State.class);
    if (countryInDB == null) 
{
      countryInDB = new Country(ctry);
      mongoOperation.save(countryInDB);
    }

    if (stateInDB == null) 
{
      countryInDB = get(mongoOperation, "country", "name", ctry,Country.class);
      stateInDB = new State(state, countryInDB,
          "VS", 1200L);
      mongoOperation.save(stateInDB);
      countryInDB.getStates().add(stateInDB);
     
      mongoOperation.save(countryInDB);
      //Why do I have to execute the following two lines to save properly???????
      //Without the following lines save doesn't work - state is already saved. why i have to save it a second time?
      stateInDB = get(mongoOperation, "state", "name", state, State.class);
      mongoOperation.save(stateInDB);
    }
