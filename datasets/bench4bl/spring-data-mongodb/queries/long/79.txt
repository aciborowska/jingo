Using:
@Indexed(name = "foo", collection="test", unique = true, dropDups = true)
private String bar;
causes an exception to be thrown, along the lines of:
com.mongodb.MongoException$DuplicateKey: E11000 duplicate key error index: mongoDb.test.$foo_1  dup key: { : null }
but checking via shell of mongodb, the index is still created and all but one entry in the collection is dropped.
