Even though the org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.query.Update.inc(String, Number) method takes the parameter as Number, it doesn't actually work right with things that aren't simple primitive object wrappers.  For example, if you pass in an AtomicInteger, the update fails to execute, as the generated json isn't correct.
