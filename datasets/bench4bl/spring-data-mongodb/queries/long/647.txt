I created a method using the "query by method name" approach:
Inside my Answer object, I have a field called "Score" that is annotated with
@Field("sr")
int Score
List<Answer> findByQuestionIdOrderByScoreDesc(String questionId)
When the query is run, the database attempts to sort the results by "score" rather than my "sr" field name.
