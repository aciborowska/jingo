Hiya,
Have found what looks like it might be a regression of https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAMONGO-807 or at the very least a similar problem.
Essentially for our use-case when we use findAndModify() to add to a set of encapsulated classes the "_class" attribute will not be present in the added elements which causes an error on de-serialisation.
This is because the encapsulated class is inherited from an abstract class that is not meant to be instanced and without .the "_class" attribute it will obviously default to whatever is the type of the member in the containing class.
Please see the test-case for a full illustration of the problem:

Thanks,
 Peter
