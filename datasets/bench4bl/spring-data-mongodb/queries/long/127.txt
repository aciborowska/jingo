Hi all,I check out spring-data-document source from git,version e4fdabb.I found that the @Document annotation support a collection value,does this mean the collection where the POJO shold save to?
So I've makd some tests(ie @Document(collection="test")),but the POJO still save to a collection which just used the POJO's class name.
Does there a bug or I just use the @Document annotation in a wrong way?
