Reading empty maps from mongoDB works fine for usual Maps such as LinkedHashMaps.
When using other interface types such as SortedMaps it fails because it does not safely detect these maps.
I attached a test with 4 methods of which 1 is failing.
All test methods insert an entity containing 2 empty maps with one map being a java.util.Map and the other one a java.util.SortedMap.
When inserting the entity with empty maps Spring Data Document does not add any "_class" property to both of the map instances.
When reading them again the MappingMongoConverter tries to instanciate both maps with a LinkedHashMap which fails for the java.util.SortedMap (see method testFindListWithResultAndEmptyValues)
This issue might be similar to DATAMONGO-192 which was related to java.util.List(s)?
