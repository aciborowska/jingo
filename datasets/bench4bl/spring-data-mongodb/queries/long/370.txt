Hi, 
I tried to save and load a 2-dimension array as nested array.
Save works fine, I checked data directly via mongo console.
But "load" by findOne seems have a problem. 
1st dimension of array loaded well, but actual 2nd dimension is just 0.
I attach my unit test code and data class to be saved.
Please take a look.
Thanks a lot to this handy tool.
