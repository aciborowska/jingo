As I can see in the code and with the behavior I'm currently experiencing, it seems that limit on MapReduceOptions is not working.
In the source code, there's no attribute set with the provided param, the limit(int limit) method only return the current instance.






public MapReduceOptions limit(int limit) {




    return this;




}
