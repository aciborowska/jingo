This is similar to DATAMONGO-467 which was resolved a while back.
But in this case instead of .eq() I am using .in().






@Document




public class User {




    @Id String id;




}




Â 




Collection<String> collection = new ArrayList<>();




collection.add("abcdef.....");




Iterable<User> user = userRepository.findAll(QUser.user.id.in(collection));






This is translating to $in clause with empty collection
