Scenario:
1. Domain class is loaded from mongodb using CrudRepository.findOne(…) method.
2. The loaded instance’s any non id nor @Version annotated field is set to null. 
3. The loaded instance is saved to same mongodb using CrudRepository.save(…) method.
4. The field that has been set to null doesn’t write to database, it’s unchanged.
Important: The problem doesn’t occur when @Version annotation is not used in the domain class definition.
