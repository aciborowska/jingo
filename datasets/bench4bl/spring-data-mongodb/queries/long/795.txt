When adding custom converters to the mongo template it is possible to get unpredictable behavior.
It is possible to attempt to retrieve a target type from getCustomTarget(â€¦) from CustomConverters by passing null to the expectedTargetType. This can result in unpredictable behavior if 2 converters with the same sourceType but different targetType are registered.
