Documentation says that its possible to return List for query methods with Pageable parameter. It works for Spring Data JPA but not for Spring Data MongoDB.
In order to fix that org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.query.AbstractMongoQuery.CollectionExecution could take provided Pageable parameter (nullable) from MongoParametersParameterAccessor and return paged result if pageable is not null.
Pull request is on its way.
