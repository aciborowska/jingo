Quotes are being added to values passed into @Query annotations.
@Query( value = "
{ ?0 }
", fields = "
{ ?1 }
" )
someMethod( String values, String fields );
Whatever I pass into "values" or "fields" gets wrapped in quotes when inserted into the query sent to MongoDB.
String values = "value : 'things'";
  -> rendered as - 
{ "value : 'things'" }
  -> This is not a valid query - the double quotes around it break it.
String values = "field : 0";
  -> rendered as - 
{ "field : 0" }
  -> This is not a valid projection - the double quotes around it break it.
String values = "field\" : \"0";
  -> rendered as - 
{ "field" : "0" }
  -> This is not a valid projection - the double quotes around zero turn it into a string so it renders as "true" instead of 0/undefined.
Thanks.
