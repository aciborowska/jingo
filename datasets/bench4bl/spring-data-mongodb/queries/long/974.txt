Detected while trying to multiply a calculated result ($minute of a date field in this case) with a constant number, the command generated would be:
$multiply: [ 60000, "$date" ]
instead of the function performed on the date field in a previous projection (i.e: $multiply: [ 60000, "$my_minutes_field" ] )
found that the root cause of this issue is in the ExposedFields.getRaw() method which doesn't check if the field is synthetic:
public String getRaw() 
{

			String target = field.getTarget();
			return field.synthetic ? target : String.format("%s.%s", Fields.UNDERSCORE_ID, target);
		}



I think it should be fixed this way:
String target = field.synthetic ? field.getName() : field.getTarget();
