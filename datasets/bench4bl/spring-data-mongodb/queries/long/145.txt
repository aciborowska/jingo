If you have a class that contains a collection of interfaces the values inside the collection are not mapped correctly. This is due to the fact that the recursive call to map the element uses the collection's component type which of course does not contain PersistentProperty instances as it is an interface. Using abstract classes that way will probably suffer from the same issues.
