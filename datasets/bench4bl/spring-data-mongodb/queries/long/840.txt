At present we don't support nested field references in Aggregation Framework projections like:






.andExpression("foo.bar * foo.bubu").as("product")






... because we eagerly interpret a field path like "foo.bar" as a compound expression. We should treat an ExpressionNode as a CompoundExpression iif the first component is an array indexer (e.g. [0].bubu) that references the "bubu" property of the first parameter passed to andExpression(expr,params...), otherwise we should pass a field path like "foo.bar" as is (may be in prefixed form like: $foo.bar) to the underlying DBObject.
As a workaround one could explicitly quote and prefix such nested field paths with "$" to treat it as a regular MongoDB field reference:






.andExpression("'$foo.bar' * '$foo.bubu'").as("product")
