When updating one record that is versioned with a @Version annotation, I was expecting the version field to be incremented automatically by the Spring Data layer just as is the behavior of JPA. This however does not happen and I have to add â€¦.inc("version", 1) to the update object in order to get the increment. 
Not sure that this is a bug, or my understanding is incorrect.
