There is no way to $set multiple fields in one update.
I had a look at the implementation of update, and a call like this
Update update = new Update();
update.set("field1", "value1");
update.set("field2", "value2");
concludes with field1 being excluded from the update.
It is possible to update the document in one call using the driver, so it should be possible to update in one call using the MongoTemplate:
DBObject update = new BasicDBObjectBuilder().add("field1", "value1").add("field2", "value2").get();
DBObject set = new BasicDBObjectBuilder().add("$set", update).get();
DBObject query = new BasicDBObjectBuilder().add("_id", 1234L).get();
DBCollection collection = getCollection();
collection.update(query, set, false, false, WriteConcern.SAFE);
Oliver, can you let me know if it is acceptable to open defects like this without clearing it with you first?
