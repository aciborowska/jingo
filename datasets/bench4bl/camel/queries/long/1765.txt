The license for the com/simontuffs/onejar files is at http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=documents&file=license.
When I build camel-example-spring neither this license nor the apache license nor apache notice file is in the one-jar.jar artifact.
I'd suggest disabling the one-jar plugin until someone can figure out how to include these files.
