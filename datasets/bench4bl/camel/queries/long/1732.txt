The camel mail component has a feature to send a mail
in text/plain and text/html. To do that the text/html content
is placed in the message body, the text/plain content
in the header mail_alternateBody (camel 1.6.1) and the message is
send via smtp with the content type set to text/html.
The message is displayed as expected in a mail reader
but contains also the mail_alternateBody header field with
the text/plain part, which means that the text/plain part
is included twice in the mail once mime encoded and once in
the mail header.
