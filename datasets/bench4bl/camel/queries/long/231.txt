I tried to figure out how i could edit the wiki page myself - i created an account but do not have edit rights, or I could not find the edit button.
Type converts has a broken link:
http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CAMEL/Type+Converter
In the chapter "Discovering Type Converts" the link for @Converter is missing the h in http so the link is broken.
"ttp://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Converter"
