I did not find any example or documentation for using the <camel:proxy> with a simple send(String textMessage) method and a route sending the textMessage String as body to a JMS queue (for example).
The thing is that <camel:proxy> creates a messages with body of type BeanInvocation. I would expect that Camel provides some builtin transformer/converter to change the body to the String argument, so that the message on the queue is of type TextMessage.
Did I miss something?
