Its really a bad habit having a dot in a directory name.
On windows will that not often be considered a file?.
And since its a remote path we cannot on startup determine if its a
path or file.
The check was made in the transition from 1.x to 2.x where in 1.x you
could define a starting file or directory.
In 2.x you must specify a directory only.
We could relax the check but then people may still enter a filename
and think Camel will pickup that file.

Windows directory can contains a dot... a good example is in your eclipse installation... example:
Directory name=org.eclipse.emf.teneo.jpox_1.0.1.v200902271808
Also I think that check is useless because you can still enter something without a dot and it is in fact a file... so the endpoint should verify that after the connection.

Yeah good call
Do you mind creating a ticket in JIRA about this?
