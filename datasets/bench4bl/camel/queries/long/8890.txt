The maven plugin is failing to generate the DTOs. It appears that Salesforce has recently introduced a new boolean field call encrypted to the 'DescribeSObjectResult' object [1,2]
The fix is to modify the org.apache.camel.component.salesforce.api.dto.SObjectField and add the following:
private Boolean encrypted;
   public Boolean getEncrypted() 
{

        return encrypted;

    }

    public void setEncrypted(Boolean encrypted) 
{

        this.encrypted = encrypted;

    }

With this change the DTOs are generated. However, not sure if there is anything else which needs to be done.
Btw, I am surprised that this new field causes a problem because the default API version Camel-Salesforce is configured to is 33.0 and this new field appears in 34.0.
