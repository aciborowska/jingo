I am struggling with random deployment failures of bundles containing Camel routes, packaged in a KAR file. Deployment fails mostly because data formats cannot be found on the classpath or Camel component beans are not found in the registry.
The attached sample KAR file contains one bundle with the following blueprint deployment descriptor:



<blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0" 			xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 			xmlns:camel="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint" 			xsi:schemaLocation="				http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0 http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0/blueprint.xsd

				http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint/camel-blueprint-2.16.1.xsd">

 

	<bean id="processor" class="ch.rsteppac.karissue.RestProcessor" />



	<camelContext id="rest-api" allowUseOriginalMessage="false" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">

		<restConfiguration component="netty4-http" scheme="http" host="0.0.0.0" port="2016" bindingMode="json">

			<dataFormatProperty key="prettyPrint" value="true" />

		</restConfiguration>



		<rest path="/say/hello" id="poc-route" produces="application/json">

			<get uri="/{yourName}">

				<route>

					<camel:process ref="processor" />

				</route>

			</get>

		</rest>

	</camelContext>

</blueprint>



The feature file of the KAR:



<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

<features xmlns="http://karaf.apache.org/xmlns/features/v1.3.0" name="KAR deployment issue PoC">

    <repository>mvn:org.apache.camel.karaf/apache-camel/2.16.1/xml/features</repository>

    <feature name="poc-rest-service" description="Sample REST bundle to demonstrate the deployment issue in Karaf 4" version="0.0.1.SNAPSHOT">

        <details>Sample REST bundle to demonstrate the deployment issue in Karaf 4</details>

        <feature version="2.16.1" prerequisite="false" dependency="false">camel-jackson</feature>

        <feature version="2.16.1" prerequisite="false" dependency="false">camel-blueprint</feature>

        <feature version="2.16.1" prerequisite="false" dependency="false">camel-netty4-http</feature>

        <bundle>mvn:ch.rsteppac.kar-issue/poc-rest-service/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</bundle>

    </feature>

</features>



On my development machine (OSX) deploying the sample KAR file succeeds about 8 out of 10 times. It appears that the more features the KAR file contains the lower the probability of success. Our actual project KAR fails deployment about 9 out of 10 times.
Not all Camel components are equally likely to cause the deployment failure. The most likely to trigger a failure are data formats, e.g., jackson-json or jaxb.
Once the KAR file has deployed successfully, restarting Karaf will consistently deploy the bundles successfully. Until one deletes Karaf's data folder, then all bets are off again.
Adding the feature.xml generated for the KAR with feature:repo-add and then deploying the features with feature:install virtually never fails.
Stack traces for most frequent deployment failure of the sample KAR are attached to the ticket.
EDIT
The issue is actually unrelated to fact that the features are deployed via a KAR file. While I can successfully install each feature individually on the command line, if I restart Karaf and the features are deployed from the $KARAF_HOME/data directory, the behavior is the same as described above.
I encountered another class of errors: A bean declared in the blueprint context was not resolvable in the Camel context in the same file. 
Defining a start-level for my bundles (90) seems to be a workaround for the different issues described above.
