If the UndertowHttpBinding is initialized at component level when someone defines a custom HeaderFilterStrategy it will be set at component level, so all the subsequent endpoints created will use this custom strategy instead of the default one. I'll move the UndertowHttpBinding initialization in the Undertow Endpoint.
