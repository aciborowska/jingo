Camel-soap code assumes that all Faults that a Camel SOAP endpoint is receiving, are containing a Detail element. Sending a Fault without Detail will result in an NPE. Detail is optional element in SOAP Faults (see http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/#soapfault) and its absence should not generate an error.
