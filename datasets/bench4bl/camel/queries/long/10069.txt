If the contextClassLoader is set, Kafka only uses that when looking for the dynamically loaded classes.   That means the users application bundle must import those classes which may not be the case since they are generally just configured in as strings.   We could pre-process those strings to check not just the application context but also the camel-kafka classloader and the kafka classloader so that the default serializers can be found.
