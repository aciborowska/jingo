While working with the ZipSplitter component of Camel i am encounter a problem.
Splitting a ZIP-archive with say 2 files in it, leads to 3 message coming out of the split(). The additional message seems not to contain any data (header and body are null).
I wrote a simple test case to show my case. The ZipIterator of Camel uses the default Java implementation to split ZIPs, so i added this method to the test as well to show the difference.
I hope this helps to solve the problem.
Best regards.
