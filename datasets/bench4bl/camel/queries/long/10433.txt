There is no version range restriction of jetty feature in the camel-jetty and camel-jetty9 feature definition.



    <feature>jetty</feature>



For camel-jetty9 feature, it maybe should add version range like this:



    <feature version='[9,10)'>jetty</feature>



For camel-jetty feature, it maybe should add version range like this:



    <feature version='[8,9)'>jetty</feature>



Because from karaf 4.x there are both jetty 8 and jetty 9 feature existing. Making this changes will avoid install the wrong version jetty bundles when install camel-jetty (or camel-jetty8 of Camel 2.17.x)
