Trying to bootstrap camel in a @singleton @startup bean with enabled CDI leads to a deployment exception.
 Ambiguous dependencies for type CdiCamelContext with qualifiers @Default

org.apache.camel.cdi.internal.CamelContextBean@35921a07,
Managed Bean [class org.apache.camel.cdi.CdiCamelContext] with qualifiers [@Any @Default]

The only way to workaround this, is to implement a custom Cdi-Extension to veto the bean in question.
Here is a demo-app: https://github.com/myfear/CamelEE7/
(including workaround)
The deployment exception:

This should be solved in order to make it easier to use Camel on EE servers with CDI integration.
