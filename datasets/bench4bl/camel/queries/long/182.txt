Exceptions are not handled when exception processing is done by pipeline.
It is probably because pipeline breaks when exchange contains an exception and there is exception because in org.apache.camel.processor.DeadLetterChannel.process(Exchange, AsyncCallback, RedeliveryData) method when you handle exception you clear it, but just few lines later in incrementRedeliveryCounter invocation you set it back.
JUnit test attached.
