Here is a email thread on this issue.   Basically, the CxfProducer rrelies on Jaxws/ClientFactoryBean to create a client object.  However, JaxwsClientFactoryBean does not support setting and building jaxws handler chain.   Even if it did, we would still have to replicate the same logics (that build the handler chain) in Camel's CxfClientFactoryBean because it CxfClientFactoryBean is a hybrid of both Jaxws and simple client frontend.
