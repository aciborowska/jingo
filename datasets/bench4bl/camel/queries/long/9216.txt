Developing a route that uses AMQP, I followed the description on the page at http://camel.apache.org/amqp.html. I had a problem where the route would not start. The way past that, suggested on stack overflow, was to change the bean id from "amqpConnection" to "amqp" matching the prefix in the uri of the route component.
