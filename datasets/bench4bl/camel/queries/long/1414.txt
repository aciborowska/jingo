When using this kind of route
<from uri="activemq:queue:test"/>
<camel:process ref="mailProcessor" />
<to uri="smtp://localhost:25?to=user@localhost" />
and trying to enrich the message in the mailProcessor with
exchange.getIn().addAttachment("attachement.txt",
                new DataHandler("Hello world", "text/plain"));
The received mail doesn't contains any attachment.
If the input "from" is a "direct" instead of activemq, it works fine.
Inspecting source code,  MessageSupport.copyFrom(Message that) does
getAttachments().putAll(that.getAttachments());
but the child class JmsMessage doesn't.
