This is a staging problem that could be fixed either manually (but there are a lot of metadata files in camel), or will be fixed automatically during the next release - 1.6 (which should come out shortly, still a few issues to resolve).
I'll am looking for a script that could fix all the files automatically, if not, we'll decide if to wait for the next release or bite the bullet and apply a manual fix.
