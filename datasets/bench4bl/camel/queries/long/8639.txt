Camel FTP endpoint cannot recover by itself after network failure if no custom PollingConsumerPollStrategy is defined. Few years ago there was similar issue (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-1838), and it was fixed by adding in RemoteFileConsumer:
this.setPollStrategy(new RemoteFilePollingConsumerPollStrategy());
However it is broken again, as FtpEndpoint is overriding it with DefaultPollingConsumerPollStrategy in initConsumerProperties method, inherited from ScheduledPollEndpoint. I believe RemoteFilePollingConsumerPollStrategy should be used as default in RemoteFileEndpoint as well.
Adding this.setPollStrategy(new RemoteFilePollingConsumerPollStrategy()); in RemoteFilePollingConsumerPollStrategy should fix this issue.
Workaround for this bug is to create RemoteFilePollingConsumerPollStrategy in the registry and provide it directly to FTP endpoint by adding consumer.pollStrategy=#myRemoteFilePollingConsumerPollStrategyBeanId to the URL. This is also why FromFtpSimulateNetworkIssueRecoverTest didn't catch it - it's using custom PollingStrategy.
