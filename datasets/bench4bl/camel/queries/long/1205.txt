I was messing with camel-spring and routes using spring DSL
I had this part of unit test code

    @EndpointInject(name = "myFileEndpoint")
    protected Endpoint inputFile;


To lookup an endppoint with the given name myFileEndpoint
But if I define it directly then it cannot be found

        <route>
            <from id="myFileEndpoint" uri="file://target/antpathmatcher?consumer.recursive=true&amp;filter=#myFilter"/>
            <to uri="mock:result"/>
        </route>


So I have to define it as a loose endpoint as:

        <endpoint id="myFileEndpoint" uri="file://target/antpathmatcher?consumer.recursive=true&amp;filter=#myFilter"/>

        <route>
            <from ref="myFileEndpoint"/>
            <to uri="mock:result"/>
        </route>
