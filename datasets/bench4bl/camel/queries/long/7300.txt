Currently the TypeConverter in the camel-hl7 component uses a default PipeParser. This parser performs HL7 message validation (using the default validation profile) even if validation on the endpoint is disabled.
IMHO the TypeConverter shouldn't perform any validation at all, it's not the responsible of a TypeConverter. It should just convert types. Validation is already the responsibility of the consumer and enabled by default.
