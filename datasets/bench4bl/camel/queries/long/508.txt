In InstrumentationAgentImpl.doStart(), the method createMBeanServer() is never get invoked if mbean server  is not injected because
the getMBeanServer() always return non-null (the getMBeanServer() method always returns the platform mbean server)
         if (getMBeanServer() == null) 
{
             // The MBeanServer was not injected
            createMBeanServer();
         }

A few side effects if not calling the createMBeanServer() method.
1. users always get platform mbean server
2. system properties processing in createMBeanServer() is bypassed
3. jmx connector is not created as it is created indirectly by the createMBeanServer() metthod.
I propose to invoke createMBeanServer() inside getMBeanServer() and update createMBeanServer() to read a property to determine when platform mbean should be use. (see attached patch)
