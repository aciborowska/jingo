You should be able to set ftp endpoint uri as:

"ftp://scott@localhost:" + getPort() + "/deletefile?password=tiger&binary=false&delete=true"


And when using password and username in the userinfo part of the uri:

"ftp://tiger:scott@localhost:" + getPort() + "/deletefile?binary=false&delete=true"


The latter didn't work
