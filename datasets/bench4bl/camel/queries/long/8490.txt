Camel-catalog pom specify that it wants to export the org.apache.camel.catalog.archetypes.
Unfortunately, this package does not exist in the bundle, so it tries to import it.
As this package isn't present in any other bundle, this bundle won't start in any OSGI environment.
As this package is referenced in the camel-core Karaf feature, not any camel feature can be started...
Please remove 'org.apache.camel.catalog.archetypes' in the 'camel.osgi.export.pkg' property section of this module pom.xml.
