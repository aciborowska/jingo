There are incompatible versions of qpid-jms-client and proton-j in camel-amqp feature. The qpid-jms-client 0.8.0 is dependent on proton-j 0.12.0 but there is proton-j 0.10 in the feature. This makes amqp over qpid-jms-client unusable since AmqpProvider calls method setEmitFlowEventOnSend on proton-j object which turns out in NoSuchMethodException in the AmqpProvider and the provider fails.
