When using the Scala DSL, xpath expressions inside when() do not work as expected. As an example:



     "direct:a" ==> {

     choice {

        when (xpath("//hello")) to ("mock:english")

        when (xpath("//hallo")) {

          to ("mock:dutch")

          to ("mock:german")

        } 

        otherwise to ("mock:french")

      }

    }



// Send messages

"direct:a" ! ("<hello/>", "<hallo/>", "<hellos/>")



Here we should receive 1 message in each of the mocks. For whatever reason, all 3 messages go to mock:english. Similar routes work as expected with the Java DSL.
