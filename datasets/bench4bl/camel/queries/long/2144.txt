Start a fine configured system with came-cxf consumer endpoint using http. Make some tests with valid SOAP-Messages. Then just send a HTTP-Get-Request to the endpoint (e.g. with Browser). You'll get some kind of Exception saying
java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.cxf.message.MessageContentsList cannot be cast to org.w3c.dom.Node
Ok, this could be interpreted as "There is no content to convert into Node..." as, if you debug, you'll see, that an empty MessageContentsList is provided by camel-cxf as the body of the camel message. Of course, if the Request would contain a body, the camel body would be a non empty MessageContentsList and the type converter mechanism would find a way to convert the list into a w3c Document, but that's not the point. The Bug is, that this null-body-request puts the DefaultTypeConverter into a state, that let always return null for bodies of type MessageContentsList, even if it's not empty (which is normal). I think that there is certain 'misses'-map responsible for that kind of 'miss'-state...
