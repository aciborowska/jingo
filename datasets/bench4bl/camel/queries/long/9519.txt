The POM in a new project created using the camel-archetype-blueprint archetype has a configuration for the maven-bundle-plugin that causes CamelBlueprintTestSupport-based test to fail under some conditions.
When Blueprint property placeholders are used and the blueprint.xml file is in src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint, the test will randomly fail.  Also, the camel context is created a large number of times, when it should only be created twice (the initial creation and then again when the blueprint is reloaded because of the properties change).
