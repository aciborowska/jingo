The order of when RouteBuilder is added to CdiCamelContext is after it has been started.
You can see this from running 
    mvn camel:run
in the examples/camel-example-cdi
Then it says 0 of 0 routes started.



2015-11-18 17:57:20,045 [weld-worker-3  ] WARN  Validator                      - WELD-001473: javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Bean implementation org.apache.camel.cdi.internal.CamelContextBean@73690a3e declared a normal scope but does not implement javax.enterprise.inject.spi.PassivationCapable. It won't be possible to inject this bean into a bean with a passivating scope (@SessionScoped, @ConversationScoped). This can be fixed by assigning the Bean implementation a unique id by implementing the PassivationCapable interface.
