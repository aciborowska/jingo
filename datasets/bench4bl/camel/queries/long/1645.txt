The document at http://camel.apache.org/mail.html suggests that contentType header should set the Content-Type of the out going mail, but that doesn't work.
I am trying to set the content type of the mail I send using the contentType header. That doesn't work, but it works if I put the contentType in the endpoint uri. i.e. - 
            <camel:setHeader headerName="contentType"> 
                <camel:constant>text/html</camel:constant> 
            </camel:setHeader> 
Has no effect, while this works - 
             smtp://rohitr@xyzab.pramati.com?password=32478hds78&contentType=text/html 
But I am not able to set the charset and it always takes us-ascii 
So for the mail the content type header comes as - 
Content-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii
I tried using 
            <camel:setHeader headerName="contentType"> 
                <camel:constant>text/html;charset=UTF-8</camel:constant> 
            </camel:setHeader> 
and also 
            <camel:setHeader headerName="content-type"> 
                <camel:constant>text/html;charset=UTF-8</camel:constant> 
            </camel:setHeader> 
and 
smtp://rohitr@xyzab.pramati.com?password= 32478hds78&contentType=text/html;charset=UTF-8 
but nothing works
