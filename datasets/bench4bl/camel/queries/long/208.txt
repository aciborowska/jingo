Construct like:

setOutHeader("header", constant("test")).
setOutBody(constant("body"));


doesn't work because setOutHeader() sets only header on out message that has null body. Then in pipeline when it creates new exchange it copies out message to in only when out message is not null and it contains not null body (that is not the case here). So pipeline copies in -> in so our out header is lost.
Set out header should just copy message body or (I believe better solution) createNewExchange in pipeline should use out message even if body is null (consistent with ExchangeHelper.copyResults).
