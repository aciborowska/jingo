The current Bean Expression mechanism doesn't support the use of a Predicate as the Bean/POJO.  The problem is that BeanInfo tries to use matches(Object) instead of matches(Exchange).  If you use the extra "methodName" hint, this happens because BeanInfo uses operations.get(name), which will only return the most recently introspected method (potentially the Object one.)  If you don't, then BeanInfo will try to find a method based on the inbound message body type, ignoring methods that take Exchange as a parameter.
This may too esoteric to bother working around?  It's relatively easy to workaround for the common case (match the incoming body), but it's still a little unexpected.  The only thing I can see this preventing is the use of Predicates that are looking at multiple messages at once (eg: comparing delta between in & out messages in an exchange.)
