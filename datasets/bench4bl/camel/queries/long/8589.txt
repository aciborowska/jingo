In our environment, the camel-swagger component is building relative urls with a port of -1. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/URL.html#getPort() is what is returning -1.
The fix is to change
      if (url.getPort != 80) {
to
      if (url.getPort != 80 && url.getPort != -1) {
in RestSwaggerApiDeclarationServlet.scala. See https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/camel-2.15.x/components/camel-swagger/src/main/scala/org/apache/camel/component/swagger/RestSwaggerApiDeclarationServlet.scala#L111 for the line of code that is affected.
