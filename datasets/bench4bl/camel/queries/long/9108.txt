It was noticed in camel-kafka 2.15.3 that the KafkaProducer was reading the kafka.TOPIC off of the Exchange envelope instead of reading it off of the configured KafkaEndpoint/Configuration which subsequently breaks the ability to route messages from a Kafka topic to a Kafka topic based upon a Predicate.
```
from("kafka:localhost:9092?topic=A&groupId=B....").to("kafka:localhost:9092?topic=B.....")
```
I've created a pull request on github that addresses this issue:
