This bug only surfaces when you use an anonymous inline processor for redelivery as it wont be wrapped in a route with a pipeline etc, that doesnt call the done if it was completed sync
So we havent seen this bug before now:

                errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("mock:error").delayPattern("0:250;2:500").maximumRedeliveries(3)
                        .onRedelivery(new Processor() {
                    public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                        counter++;
                    }
               }));


Will resolve in a NPE later.
But this works:

                errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("mock:error")
                        .onRedelivery(new MyRedeliverPrcessor())


Since the processor is not inlined.
