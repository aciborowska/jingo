Looks like update CAMEL-8948 dropped support for multiple blueprint descriptors within CamelBlueprintTestSupport file within camel-test-blueprint component. The symptom is a 'java.lang.RuntimeException: InputStream cannot be null' for unit tests that have a getBlueprintDescriptor with multiple file references, i.e. a '+' concatenating two or more descriptor files.
