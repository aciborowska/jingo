Hi,
I am playing with Camel 1.4-SNAPSHOT.
I have created a route that goes to jpa, but I receive the error
"[PersistenceUnit: camel-jpa] class or package not found". 
In persistence.xml in camel-jpa-1.4-SNAPSHOT.jar camel-jpa is defined as:
<persistence-unit name="camel-jpa" transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL">
<class>org.apache.camel.processor.idempotent.jpa.MessageProcessed</class>
  </persistence-unit>
Where can I find the MessageProcessed class? It is not in camel-core nor camel-jpa.
