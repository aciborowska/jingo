In the ZipDataForamt class you find
 final Deflater deflater = new Deflater(compressionLevel);
        final DeflaterOutputStream zipOutput = new DeflaterOutputStream(stream, new Deflater(compressionLevel));
        try 
{

            IOHelper.copy(is, zipOutput);

        }
 finally {
            IOHelper.close(is, zipOutput);
            /*

As we create the Deflater our self and do not use the stream default
(see 
{@link java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream#usesDefaultDeflater}
)
we need to close the Deflater to not risk a OutOfMemoryException
in native code parts (see 
{@link java.util.zip.Deflater#end}
)
            */
            deflater.end();
        }

the deflater variable should be used in the DeflaterOutputStream
final DeflaterOutputStream zipOutput = new DeflaterOutputStream(stream, deflater);
