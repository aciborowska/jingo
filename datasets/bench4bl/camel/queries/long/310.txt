OgnlExpression eagerly gets an Exchange's Out Message when it's processing an Exchange.  This causes Pipeline to propagate the non-null Out Message (with null headers/body,) even in cases where the intention is propagate the In Message.  
eg:

<from uri="direct:start" />
<choice>
<when>
<ognl>request.header.foo == 'bar'</ognl>
<to uri="mock:getsInMessage" />
<to uri="mock:getsOutMessage" />
</when>
</choice>


The attached patch modifies OgnlExpression to avoid the eager fetch (the map being populated with the value seems unused anyway.)  Long term, maybe Pipeline should look at the Exchange's Pattern to determine which message it needs to propagate?
