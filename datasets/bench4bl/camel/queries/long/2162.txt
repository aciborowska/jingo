1. Installed latest apache-camel
2. Applied the patch that is attached to Camel-2155 
3. Compile the sample using mvn compile
4. Install the camel sample into repository using "mvn clean install" command
5. Open the package (i.e. jar file) from <USERPROFILE>\.m2\repository\org\apache\camel\camel-example-cxf\<Camel-Version> folder and observe that jms folder is not there under "org.apache.camel.example" location
This can be resolved by modifying the existing "properties" tag to
<properties>
     <camel.osgi.export.pkg>
     	org.apache.camel.example.cxf.*;$
{camel.osgi.version},
     	org.apache.camel.example.camel.transport.*;${camel.osgi.version}
,
	+org.apache.camel.example.camel.jms.*;$
{camel.osgi.version}
+
     </camel.osgi.export.pkg>
  </properties>
After applying the above workaround, I am still facing some problems when we start the bundle. I will update this bug with the remaining errors also
