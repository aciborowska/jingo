A java.nio.channels.ClosedByInterruptException exception is encountered when processing the first message for a file endpoint and a file must be created.
The exception occurs at the line of code labeled ** in the following FileOperations function:
    private FileChannel prepareOutputFileChannel(File target, FileChannel out) throws IOException {
        if (endpoint.isAppend()) 
{
            out = new RandomAccessFile(target, "rw").getChannel();
            out = out.position(out.size());  // ** Exception here
        }
 else 
{
            out = new FileOutputStream(target).getChannel();
        }
        return out;
    }
I ran the unit test org.apache.camel.component.file.NewFileProduceTest and it passes, so it seems to be something specific to how the route is configured, such as the use of the aggregator.
