This worked in 2.15.x: 
RoutesDefinition routeDef = someRouteDef(); 
routeDef.onException(someException) 
   .wireTap(someUri) 
   .newExchange(someProcessor) 
   .end() 
   .handled(true) 
   .bean(someBean); 
But in 2.16.0 it seems like .handled(..) isn't available anymore.  Any 
suggestions on how to mark this as handled now?
