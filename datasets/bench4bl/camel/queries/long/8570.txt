I get a NullPointerException when using log-level INFO or finer in a spring-boot application with CXF. 
The exception is thrown from DefaultCamelContext.java:2449, where it tries to log how many routes have been started.
I have made an example project to reproduce it, it's available here: 
https://github.com/jakobthun/spring-boot-camel-cxf-logging-bug
I have tried with camel version: 2.15.0 & 2.15-SNAPSHOT. Both have the same behaviour.
Andrew Block started som analysis:
It is running into issues in this code block which is executed at logging level >= INFO 
        if (log.isInfoEnabled()) { 
            // count how many routes are actually started 
            int started = 0; 
            for (Route route : getRoutes()) { 
                if (getRouteStatus(route.getId()).isStarted()) 
{ 

                    started++; 

                }
 
            } 
            log.info("Total " + getRoutes().size() + " routes, of which " + started + " is started."); 
            log.info("Apache Camel " + getVersion() + " (CamelContext: " + getName() + ") started in " + TimeUtils.printDuration(stopWatch.taken())); 
        } 
The exception occurs when the status for the route is pulled from the route service. It is null and the exception is thrown. The route is initially spun up but then refreshes when the CXF consumer is initialized. 
Swapping it to test with a direct consumer does not result in a similar situation and startup succeeds at all logging level. 
It appears the route is not being registered with the route service
