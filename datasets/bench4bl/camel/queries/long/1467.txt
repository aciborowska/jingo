on publishing messages lots of messages using XMPP component (layered on top of Smack 3.0.4/3.1.0 client), Out of Memory Exception occurs. 
With standard JVM settings, client runs out of memory at around 6600 messages sent. With -Xmx1024M set, client runs out at ~110K messages sent.
Appears that on a
chat.sendMessage(message);
The server sends the message back and the messages needs to be processed on the client side or the client will continue filling its local queue until it runs out of memory
FIX:
For XmppPrivateChatProducer and XmppGroupChatProducer, need to insert chat.nextMessage() after chat.sendMessage()
 public void process(Exchange exchange) {
   ...
        try 
{
            chat.sendMessage(message);
            chat.nextMessage();
        }
 catch (XMPPException e) 
{
            throw new RuntimeXmppException(e);
        }
    }
