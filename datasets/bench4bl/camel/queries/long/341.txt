Hi I'm using camel 1.3-SNAPSHOT. I don't get the aggregator to work as expected when messages come from a JMS endpoint and sent to a bean. I've tried the following configuration: 
//private static final String ENDPOINT = "jms:myqueue"; 
private static final String ENDPOINT = "direct:myqueue"; 
from(ENDPOINT).aggregator(header("JMSCorrelationId"),new MyAggregatorStrategy()).bean(new SomeBean()); 
With ENDPOINT = "jms:myqueue" I get: 
[                      Thread-1] MyRouteBuilder                 INFO  Sending: message:1 
[                      Thread-1] MyRouteBuilder                 INFO  Sending: message:2 
[                      Thread-1] MyRouteBuilder                 INFO  Sending: message:3 
[meBean@3c2797]] Polling Thread] MyRouteBuilder                 INFO  Received: message:2 (null) 
End with ENDPOINT = "direct:myqueue" I get: 
[                      Thread-1] MyRouteBuilder                 INFO  Sending: message:1 
[                      Thread-1] MyRouteBuilder                 INFO  Sending: message:2 
[                      Thread-1] MyRouteBuilder                 INFO  Sending: message:3 
[meBean@3c2797]] Polling Thread] MyAggregatorStrategy           INFO  Strategy: message:1, message:2 
[meBean@3c2797]] Polling Thread] MyAggregatorStrategy           INFO  Strategy: message:1, message:2, message:3 
[meBean@3c2797]] Polling Thread] MyRouteBuilder                 INFO  Received: message:1, message:2, message:3 (null) 
Only with ENDPOINT = "direct:myqueue" I get the expected behavior. 
I've noticed the AggregatorStrategy even does not get called while using the JMS endpoit. 
I upload the complete sample (sample.zip) 
There is also a second issue I can not explain: on the sample I've tried to use a JMSCorrelationId but printing @Header(name="JMSCorrelationID") String correlationID I get "null". 
PS: Same sample using 1.2.0, the AggregatorStrategy get called but I loose message 2
