When using a JaxWS proxy with camel transport, to a route with only one processor, CXF fail with the message "Can't find input stream in message".
CamelConduit call CxfMessageHelper.getCxfInMessage which is looking for an Out part in the exchange. If the processor of the route doesn't use the Out message, or doesn't copy the in part to the out part (like the Pipeline processor), the call to the JaxWS proxy fail with "Can't find input stream in message"
