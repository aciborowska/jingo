Currently, the camel-cxf pom declares dependencies on two test JARs without specifying their scope:
   <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
      <artifactId>camel-core</artifactId>
      <type>test-jar</type>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
      <artifactId>camel-spring</artifactId>
      <type>test-jar</type>      
    </dependency>
This means that the scope defaults to "compile", and those test JARs are included with every compile, although they aren't really needed.
The fix would be to add a <scope>test</scope> element to both of these dependencies.
