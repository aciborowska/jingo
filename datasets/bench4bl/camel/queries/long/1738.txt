There seems to be a memory leak if you are using recipientList and JMX enabled. The problem is that endpoint MBean name computed by using hashCode, if there is lot of different endpoints (created on runtime) every new endpoint will create a new MBean instance. 
Also in recipientList every entry will create new endpoint. 
In example if we have 3 urls ; 
http://host/index?id=1
http://host/index?id=2
http://host/index?id=3
Camel will add 3 different MBeans entry to JMX. As url parameters are normally unique then camel will end up with creating thousands of endpoint entries. But every MBean takes memory.
