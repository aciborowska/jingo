In the CxfEndpointBeanDefinitionParser, the list elements being read are cast to com.sun.xml.bind.v2.schemagen.xmlschema.List class which is never true...
Why don't we just leave it as a object or atleast cast it to a java.util.List?
For getting the error just add the following configuration to a cxf endpoint:
  <cxf:cxfEndpoint id="toEndpoint1" 
                   address="http://localhost:9091/GreeterContext/GreeterPort" 
                   serviceClass="demo.router.Greeter">
      <cxf:features>
          <cxfcore:logging/>
      </cxf:features>
  </cxf:cxfEndpoint>
cxfcore points to the "http://cxf.apache.org/core" namespace.
I have attached a patch for this problem & would appreciate if someone applied it.
Thanks
