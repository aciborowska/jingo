Using the camel-mina component in synchronous mode (InOut exchange pattern) there is a potential bug if eg a processor throws an exception.
This is a failed delivery in camel. And out-of-the-box the default policy is to retry up till 6 times. And if still failing camel-mina will continue and return a response to the client.
The respons is a duplicate of the in body.
A workaround is to set the out body to null immediately in your processor. If the body is null before the exception is thrown then camel-mina will no return a response.
To reproduce the bug see the MinaTcpWithInOutUsingPlainSocketTest and remove the setbody null code below and the test should fail.

 else if ("force-exception".equals(in)) {
                            // clear out before throwing exception
                            e.getOut().setBody(null);
                            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Forced exception");
                        }


In MinaConsumer there is a TODO comment where the bug should be handled (from CAMEL-356)
