When I tried to use spring-redis component, it turned out it needed a dependency on Jedis, which is explained in the pom of the component. I was wondering if there's any reason for the dependency not being used (looking for a more performant redis client for example) ? Otherwise, Jedis 2.6.3 should be used as 2.7.X didn't seem to work.
