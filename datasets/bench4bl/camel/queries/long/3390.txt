 I amended the camel-example-osgi project so as to use the Java RouteBuilder, the MyRouteBuilder class in that project
I changed the blueprint.xml file to the following
	<bean id="routeBuilder" class="org.apache.camel.example.osgi.MyRouteBuilder" />
	<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">
			<routeBuilder ref="routeBuilder"/>
	</camelContext>
However nothing happens, no error message is displayed either.
If I leave the example in its original state, in other words using the xml-based dsl, then it works.
Maybe this is somehow related to the fact that packageScan does not work???
