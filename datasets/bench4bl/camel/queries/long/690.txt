XMPP component page http://activemq.apache.org/camel/xmpp.html states that uri is "xmpp:hostname[:port][/room]". But in fact it does not work: the room is not recognised for "xmpp:jabber.org/room33". There is missing // to make it a valid hierarchical uri. See http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/net/URI.html
Fix:
the url should be "xmpp://vchekan@jabber.org/room33". Notice "//".
Also: according to the code it is possible to set a user name like this:
xmpp://[login@]hostname[:port][/room]
which would be nice to mention.
Also it is not clear at all how to set up password. Without password there is not too much use of this component so it is critical to document it.
If I am provided with access to confluence, I could fix it on my own. Mu login is "vchekan".
