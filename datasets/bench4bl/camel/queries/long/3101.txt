I find an ftp operations error in camel in version 2.3.0.
In FtpOperations and SFTP Operations listFiles Method，should change direcory to root('/')，if not ,may occur an error that doesn't work well.
Example:
I configured from endpoint like:ftp://username@localhost:21/app/recfiles/TXN_JRNL_*.txt?password=pwd&binary=true&delay=1000&noop=true , I want to download files(/app/recfiles/TXN_JRNL_.txt) from server,if i don't use root user and direct to ftp user's HOME direcory not root directory('/').In RemoteFileConfiguration.java ,directory is changed to app/recfiles/TXN_JRNL_.txt，then problem occured.
Can you know what i meant?
My english is poor, please forgive me.
