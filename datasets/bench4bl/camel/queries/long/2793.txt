The docs for the new camel-spring-security component (http://camel.apache.org/spring-security.html) do not specify where the Authentication object should be placed in order to use a secured route.  Initially, I thought that the Authentication object should be a property on the exchange since the constant for authentication is on the Exchange class, but after looking at the code, I found that the component only checks the in message headers.  It would be nice to specify this in the docs.
