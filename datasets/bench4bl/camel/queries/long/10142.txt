It appears that support for a named scheduled polling consumer is there, but you have to have at least one scheduler.xxx property set before it utilises it. e.g. 
I have this configured: 
<bean id="nps-scheduler" class="org.apache.camel.pollconsumer.quartz2.QuartzScheduledPollConsumerScheduler">
    <property name="cron" value="0 * * * * ?"/>
</bean>
In my route, I reference it like this, but it doesn't use it: 
<from uri="ftp://ftp.somewhere.com/path?scheduler=nps-scheduler" />
If I add a scheduler property, it then uses it, e.g. 
<from uri="ftp://ftp.somewhere.com/path?scheduler=nps-scheduler&scheduler.triggerId=?" />
