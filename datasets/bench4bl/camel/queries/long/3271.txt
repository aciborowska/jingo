Using the following xml code does not activate the Java Camel routes that can be found in the given package;
<blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0">
	<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">
		<packageScan>
			<package>eu.schuring.camel.blueprint.route</package>
		</packageScan>
	</camelContext>
</blueprint>
Attached is a usecase that should output messages from both a native blueprint DSL route and a Java DSL route activated by the xml section above. I've attached both the bundle and a source jar.
