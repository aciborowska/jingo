Some routes are not getting instrumented using JMX and we get the following WARN for those on startup;

It turns out that its only those routes that have an onException handler as the first processor in the route, e.g.
<route id="per-msg-route" errorHandlerRef="RouteErrorHandler">
  <from uri="jms:MSG_IN"/>
  <onException>
    <exception>can.retry.Exception</exception>
    <redeliveryPolicy ref="UnlimitedRedeliveryPolicyConfig"/>
    <handled><constant>true</constant></handled>
  </onException>
  <bean ref="Formatter" method="formatInput"/>
