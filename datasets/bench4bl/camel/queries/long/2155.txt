6. Added the below packages in Import-Packge list. (We are adding the below packges because, without these the deployment is failed with class not found exceptions)
	org.apache.activemq.xbean,org.apache.activemq.broker,org.apache.activemq.pool
7. Save the Manifest.MF and the jar file as well.
8. Started the servicemix server

10. Start the bundles 
11. Observe that the bundles are started and active. No exceptions observed in the console and Karaf.log file.
