There are a few minor problems with the website:
1)  The link for the pdf version of the Camel 2.0-M2 manual is broken.
2) The list of components does not include camel-jing
3) @Handler is not included in the list of new annotations on the "Camel 2.0-M2 release" page.
4) Also on the "Camel 2.0-M2 release" page, a new option for the File component is described as "existFile".  This should be "fileExist".
