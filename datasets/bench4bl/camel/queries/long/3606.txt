A change in Camel 2.6 causes an exception to be thrown when using a stateful Quartz job in a non-clustered environment. Upon first startup, the job is persisted in the job store (e.g. database). If the app is restarted, it appears Camel is trying to recreate the persisted job and fails, thinking it is creating a duplicate schedule.
e.g. Using an endpoint such as:



<endpoint id="pingSchedule" uri="quartz://myapp/ping?cron=${ping.cron}&amp;stateful=true" />



Configure the Quartz job store to NOT be clustered (org.quartz.jobStore.isClustered = false). Start the app. Then shut it down. Now start it up a second time. The following exception is thrown:



org.apache.camel.ResolveEndpointFailedException: Failed to resolve endpoint: quartz://myapp/ping?cron=0+0+23+*+*+%3F&stateful=true due to: A Quartz job already exists with the name/group: myapp/ping
