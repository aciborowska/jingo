The CamelJcrInsert operation of the JcrProducer does not handle existing nodes properly: If some of the nodes already exist within the path provided by the CamelJcrNodeName property, they will be skipped, resulting in the creation of an incorrect node hierarchy. Therefore, JcrProducer only works correctly with newly created node hierarchies.
E.g.: For the requested path "/exists1/exists2/new-node", JcrProducer will incorrectly create "/new-node" (i.e. directly on root level), given nodes "exists1" and "exists2" do already exist in the repository.
