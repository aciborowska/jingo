On the following page: http://camel.apache.org/stream.html
In last example relating to monitoring an open file (like tail) the line is incorrect...
from("stream:file?fileName=/server/logs/server.log?scanStream=true&scanStreamDelay=1000").to("bean:logService?method=parseLogLine");
should be
from("stream:file?fileName=/server/logs/server.log&scanStream=true&scanStreamDelay=1000").to("bean:logService?method=parseLogLine");
There is a question mark after the filename field whereas this should actually be an ampersand. Unfortunately I don't have edit rights on the page to update it myself.
