When this route 

    <camel:route>
        <camel:from uri="sftp://someuser@hostname/path/to/directory/?password=secret&amp;directory=true&amp;binary=true&amp;consumer.useFixedDelay=false&amp;consumer.setNames=true&amp;consumer.recursive=false" />
        <camel:to uri="file:///C:/camel/output/" />
    </camel:route>


is configured the files in the remote directory are download, but subsequent calls of the method "pollDir" result in this exception:

[ Thread: 1 RemoteFileComponent] SftpConsumer                   WARN  Caught SftpException:2: No such file
[ Thread: 1 RemoteFileComponent] SftpConsumer                   WARN  Doing nothing for now, need to determine an appropriate action
[ Thread: 1 RemoteFileComponent] ScheduledPollConsumer          WARN  An exception occured while polling: Endpoint[sftp://someuser@hostname/path/to/directory/?password=secret&amp;directory=true&amp;binary=true&amp;consumer.useFixedDelay=false&amp;consumer.setNames=true&amp;consumer.recursive=false]: No such file 2: No such file


As you can see the slash is definitely in the configured route. If I check for the missing slash and add it to the dir variable (line 115 in SftpConsumer) then the consumer works:

    	if(!dir.startsWith("/")) {
    		dir = "/" + dir;
    	}


Didn't have the time to have a closer look. The root cause of the missing slash is somewhere else.
