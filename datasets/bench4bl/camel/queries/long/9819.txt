When performing a clean build after a fresh clone of camel, the camel-jetty8 component fails to compile due to a missing org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient dependency.
The camel-jetty8 component relies on camel-jetty9 tests:



<configuration>

  <target>

    <copy todir="target/generated/src/test/java">

      <fileset dir="../camel-jetty9/src/test/java" />

    </copy>

  </target>

</configuration>



My attempted build failed at HttpBridgeBigFormPostRouteTest.java
