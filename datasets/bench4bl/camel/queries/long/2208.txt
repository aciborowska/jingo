When using transacted routes and you also use Camel error handling then it gets complicated.
However when Camel is instructed to do redelivery such as using

            onException(Exception.class)
                    .handled(true)
                    .useOriginalBody()
                    .maximumRedeliveries(2)
                    .to("mock:error");


Then when a redelivery is attempted it happens from the start of the route, where as its supposed to happen on that failing part of the route directly.
As it does for non transacted routes.
