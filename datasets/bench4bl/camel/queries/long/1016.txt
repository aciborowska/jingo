In the org.apache.camel.util.MainSupport class, the option "-ad" (aggregate-dot) conflicts with the option "-a" (applicationContext) defined in org.apache.camel.spring.Main. Both start with "a". See MainSupport.java:437: fullName.startsWith(arg) yields true with -a and aggregate-dot.
I'm not sure if this is camel-spring or camel-core issue, it depends what was created first. It was working before so I guess the camel-core brought it in recently.
One of the options should be renamed. I would rename the -a to -ac in the camel-spring Main class. So the apps that used -a would barf on the non-existing option so people will know what's going on. What happens now is it just silently ignores your spring config file. Let me know if you need a patch for the change.
