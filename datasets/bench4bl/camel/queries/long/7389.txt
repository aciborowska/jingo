As the camel-quartz component is (unlike the camel-quartz2 component) built with a plain jar (not a bundle) and no version range is defined for the quartz package imports, the import to the quartz scheduler is generated without version information.
This will cause issues if the quartz 2.x component is also available on an OSGi system.
The provided (trivial) patch will limit the import version range for quartz packages.
