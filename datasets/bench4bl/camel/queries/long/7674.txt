From the doc http://camel.apache.org/facebook.html :



To poll, every 5 sec., all statuses on your home feed:

from("facebook://home?delay=5")

    .to("bean:blah");



But attempting to set delay parameter throws:
There are 1 parameters that couldn't be set on the endpoint. Check the uri if the parameters are spelt correctly and that they are properties of the endpoint. Unknown parameters=[{delay=60}]
Additionally, the delay was never mentioned in the parameters documentation.
