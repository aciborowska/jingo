In org/apache/camel/example/etl/EtlRoutes.java, the following line:

    from("jpa:org.apache.camel.example.etl.CustomerEntity?consumeDelete=false?consumer.delay=3000&consumeLockEntity=false")
        .setHeader(FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, el("${in.body.userName}.xml"))
        .to("file:target/customers?append=false");


seems to successfully dump the database entries to files in the target/customers directory.  Unless I'm misunderstanding the sample, the consumeDelete=false is meant to ensure that the dump of the database does not delete the entries from the database.  However, when running the etl sample querying the customer table in the database, the list is empty.  I suspect the consumeDelete=false isn't working.
