BatchSender thread in BatchProcessor doesn't expect any error thrown from Collection.add() method, so when it is thrown the whole thread dies and is never recovered. In Aggregator, where aggregation strategy exists such exceptions can be easily thrown from Collection.add() and can render Aggregator unusable.
