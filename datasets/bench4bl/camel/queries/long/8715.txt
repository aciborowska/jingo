The Spring javadocs says

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Any ResultSets opened should be closed in finally blocks
within the callback implementation. Spring will close the Statement
object after the callback returned, but this does not necessarily imply
that the ResultSet resources will be closed: the Statement objects might
get pooled by the connection pool, with 
{@code close}
 calls only
returning the object to the pool but not physically closing the resources.
