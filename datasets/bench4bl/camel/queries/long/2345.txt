This is due to the following code in Client createClient() in CxfEnpoint

        } else {
            ObjectHelper.notNull(portName, "Please provide endpoint/port name");
            ObjectHelper.notNull(serviceName, "Please provide service name");
            ClientFactoryBean factoryBean = createClientFactoryBean();


When there's only one service/port, we should just use it.
