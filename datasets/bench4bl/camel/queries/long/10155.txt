Due to the convoluted way reslet handles headers (they put headers inside the "org.restlet.http.headers") header, they are net getting filtered correctly.  
Just to add more details, this is a problem if you make 2 consecutive restlet request, because the headers from the first response will get sent to the next request without being filtered.  And if transfer-encoding is set, it can break things.
