I recently tried to convert my unit tests to junit 4 using the new Spring test framework.
Since then I get the following exception when calling the test.
Error creating bean with name 'org.apache.camel.component.cxf.transport.CamelTransportFactory#0': Injection of resource methods failed; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No matching bean of type [java.lang.String] found for dependency [collection of java.lang.String]: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate for this dependency. Dependency annotations: {}
The same happens when I activate /<context:annotation-config/>/
I think it has to do with autowiring. Do you have any idea what goes wrong here and how I can fix it?
