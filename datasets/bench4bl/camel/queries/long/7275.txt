When you have a route like this



                from("direct:start")

                    .doTry()

                        .recipientList(constant("direct:foo")).end()

                    .doCatch(Exception.class)

                        .to("mock:catch")

                        .transform().constant("doCatch")

                    .end()

                    .to("mock:result");



Then if an exception was thrown it should be catch by doCatch
A similar route with to instead works as expected.
