companies/addShare should return the created Update
Share#comment should be String instead of Comment
Group#isOpenToNonMembers and Group#allowMemberInvites should be Boolean instead of boolean
Otherwise invoking of people/addGroupMembership causes



Error invoking addGroupMembership: Unexpected {group-membership/group/is-open-to-non-members} element, Unexpected {group-membership/group/allow-member-invites}



because both attributes (that are not valid for this resource) are present.
remove role from people/getSuggestedGroupPosts
It is only for group-memberships/{id}/posts resource.
