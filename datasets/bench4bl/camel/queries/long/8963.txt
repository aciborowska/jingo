In previous versions of camel (2.13.2 for sure) it was possible to use camel:route-suspend command and specify route id only. In 2.15.2 its not possible anymore. For example:



karaf@root()> camel:route-list

 Context                           Route                                  Status

 -------                           -----                                  ------

 fi-remurex-cpty-context           fi-remurex-institution-queue           Started

karaf@root()> camel:route-suspend fi-remurex-institution-queue

Error executing command camel: route-suspend: argument context is required



At the same time, on <tab> key camel:route-suspend command still suggests route, but not context as second parameter. Used route id is unique, so I don't think its a good idea to ask for context in this case.
karaf 3.0.4, camel 2.15.2.
