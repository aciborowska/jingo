Quotes within header access are not currently handled in the same way as the inbuilt headerAs function or the body accessor notation - perhaps these should be aligned?
For instance with the following route



    <camelContext trace="false" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">

        <route>

            <from uri="direct:entry"/>



            <setHeader headerName="some key">

                <constant>hello world</constant>

            </setHeader>



            <setBody>

                <simple>${headers['some key']}</simple>

            </setBody>



            <log message="The expression evaluated to :: ${body}" />



        </route>

    </camelContext>



Outcome :

[                          main] route1                         INFO  The expression evaluated to :: 

Expected :

[                          main] route1                         INFO  The expression evaluated to :: hello world

For reference, the current notation works within other parts of the language and are handled as expected

${body['some key']}


${headerAs('some key', java.lang.Boolean}

I think the fix might be to use StringHelper.removeQuotes on line #269 within SimpleFunctionExpression.java possibly, such as

remainder = StringHelper.removeQuotes(remainder.substring(1, remainder.length() - 1));
