When i create a route with an sintax error, it cannot be started but remains into camelcontext.
An example to replicate it:
1. Deploy a route with an know id at runtime (using route definition). The route will be invalid (with an sintax error)
2. Redeploy correct route with same id
Camel throw an example because i cannot deploy a route with same id!!!
