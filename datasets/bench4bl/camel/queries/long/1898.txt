While building the camel-manual we get the log below:

[INFO] About to execute PrinceXml (see www.princexml.com)

[INFO] [prince] Uncaught Mercury exception:
[INFO] [prince] Software Error: no fallback glyph for character U+006E
[ERROR] PDF Conversion failed due to return code: 1


The first errors are because of the html being improperly generated by the maven-html-to-pdf.  The "prince: warning: bad argument" interestingly seem to be generated by prince having to create its own font, which it cannot do, for cases where the requested font is not available, like for instance a <b> bold tag with a Courier font.
We know that the pdf was not generated in the 2.0-M3 release either.  The cause of this errors popping up appears to be the wiki changes at apache. The fact that the book-in-one-page is that big does not help either.  I quickly tried with the deployed version at http://camel.apache.org/book-in-one-page.html and I get a very similar result unfortunately, so there's no quick fix or workaround it seems.
I will try to resolve this asap.  Any help/ideas I could get are highly appreciated.
