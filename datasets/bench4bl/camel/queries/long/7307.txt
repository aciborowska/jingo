I've installed and configured zookeeper and kafka servers using apache quick start guide on ubuntu running in vmware.
Running my sample producer and sending messages to server is pretty fine.
I can see produced messages in consumer instance running on my WM
Now when i run consumer locally to get messages from server it always return null Message body.
I guess it happens in KafkaEndpoint createKafkaExchange() method, as i can see message is simply ignored and never set to exchange.
