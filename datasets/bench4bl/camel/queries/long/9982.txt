When a fixed length record contains a "Link" marshalling doesn't take this field into account while with unmarshalling it is unmarshalled.
Issue comes from a difference in building the model in BindyCsvDataFormat and BindyFixedLengthDataFormat. In the csv-format all field are taken into account that have the "Link"  annotation.
