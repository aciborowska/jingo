CxfProducer didn't write back return value to the exchange, so can't get return value when other kind of consumer (such as SMX consumer) work with CxfProducer
need add 
exchange.copyFrom(cxfExchange); 
in the public void process(Exchange exchange) method
The CamelInvoker used for CxfConsumer didn't set correct ExchangePattern after create the Exchage, 
need add
        if (bop.getOperationInfo().isOneWay()) 
{
        	cxfExchange.setPattern(ExchangePattern.InOnly);
        }
 else 
{
        	cxfExchange.setPattern(ExchangePattern.InOut);
        }

to set the MEP correctly according to the Cxf ServiceModel
