Using a memory profiler, we've identified what appears to be a substantial memory leak in FileConsumer in Camel 1.5.0.  It appears that the noopMap is constantly having items added to it, but nothing performs a remove on it when the file is consumed.  This causes a very large amount of string data to be accumulated in the heap.  In our application, this was a leak of several hundred megabytes and is a showstopper.   Considering the apparent severity of this issue, it would really be nice if a fix could be incorporated into a 1.5.1 version.
