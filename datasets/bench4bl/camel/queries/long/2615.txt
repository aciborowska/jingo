As servicemix install the Pax-web jsp support, which exports the javax.el package with the version 2.1.0, and camel-juel imports the javax.el with version [1.0,2), so the camel-juel feature can't be installed in ServiceMix 4.2.0.
Because javax.el is introduced with the jsp 2.1, so we need to update the camel-juel jaxax.el imports version at the same time.
