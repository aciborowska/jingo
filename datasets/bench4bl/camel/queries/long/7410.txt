When switching from version 2.12.3 to 2.13.0 a route using the http4 component in which the httpClient.cookiePolicy and httpClient.soTimeout parameters were set inline won't start generating the following error:
Caused by: 
org.apache.camel.ResolveEndpointFailedException: Failed to resolve endpoint: http4://localhost/?httpClient.cookiePolicy=ignoreCookies&httpClient.soTimeout=10000 due to: There are 2 parameters that couldn't be set on the endpoint. Check the uri if the parameters are spelt correctly and that they are properties of the endpoint. Unknown parameters=[
{cookiePolicy=ignoreCookies, soTimeout=10000}
]
This route worked as is in 2.12.3. No indication in the document shows how to set these parameters otherwise.
