there is an issue with handling password with double && even when wrapping it into RAW() constraint 
For instance the use of URI 
http://hostname/script.php?authMethod=Basic&authPassword=RAW(pa&&word)&authUsername=usr
throws the exception: 
org.apache.camel.ResolveEndpointFailedException: Failed to resolve endpoint: http://hostname/script.php?authMethod=Basic&authPassword=RAW(pa&&word)&authUsername=usr due to: Invalid uri syntax: Double && marker found. Check the uri and remove the duplicate & marker.
