If the Bean endpoint has an explicit method name ,   the Bean processor will set the message header of Exchange.Bean_METHOD_NAME with the value of method name  before the invocation and will try to reset the message header of Exchange.Bean_METHOD_NAME with the preview method name after the invocation. 
Current camel code just set the InMessage's header , if the ExchangePatter is InOut , it forget to reset the OutMessage's header.
