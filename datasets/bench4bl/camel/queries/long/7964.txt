The HTTP 303 response in response to a POST indicates that the POST was successful. Currently, Camel Jetty will throw an exception by default for a 303. There is a work around for this, but it involves setting throwExceptionOnFailure=true, which then ignores legitimate errors. For reference on how 303 responses should work, please see the following: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get
For camel-jetty, we can add CamelRedirectListener to do this kind of thing.
