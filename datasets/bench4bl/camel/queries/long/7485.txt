AdviceWithRouteBuilder.weaveById() and weaveByToString() creates duplicated endpoint if there's a "choice" in camel route. Tested with java 1.7.0_55.
Test case to demonstrate this issue:

git clone https://github.com/joaocenoura/sandbox.git
mvn clean package -f sandbox/camel-weaving/pom.xml

Test logs shows the duplicated endpoint insertion.
