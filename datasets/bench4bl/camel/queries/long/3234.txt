If you use -Psetup.eclipse or eclipse:eclipse to setup the projects, it sets the execution environment to J2SE-1.5.  HOWEVER, if using Java6, it doesn't include many of the dependencies that are required for Java 5, like JAXB and activation and such.
I'm attaching a patch that, when you use -Psetup.eclipse, changes the compiler plugin to 1.6 when using 1.6 ONLY for that profile.   This, in effect, sets the execution environment to workspace default (which will likely be 1.6 if using 1.6) and thus things build.   The projects then import correctly and build.
FYI: this was taken from CXF's build system.
