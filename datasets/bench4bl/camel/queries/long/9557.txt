I've configured a polling Facebook consumer with nearly default Spring configuration as follows:



<camel:from uri="facebook://getFeed?

    reading.since=2016-01-01T00:00:00Z&amp;

    userId=myUserId&amp;

    consumer.delay=60000&amp;

    oAuthAppId=[s]&amp;

    oAuthAppSecret=[s]&amp;

    oAuthAccessToken=[s]

    "/>



However, an IllegalArgument is thrown with any reading.* parameter regardless of endpoint:



java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No matching operation for getFeed, with arguments [readingOptions, reading, userId]



On debugging, the method FacebookEndpoint.configureProperties sets two properties on the configuration object: (readingOptions, reading).



FacebookPropertiesHelper.configureReadingProperties(configuration, options);



readingOptions is a Map which is finally size 0 after all the relevant properties are extracted into the reading parameter. However, it isn't nullified.
In the subsequent method initState(), it tries to look for a method in FacebookMethodTypes with the signature:



getFeed(String userId, Reading reading)



Because readingOptions is non null, it looks for a readingOptions parameter as well which doesn't exist, throwing the Exception.
Is there a workaround I can use for the moment? Thanks!
