I am using camel 2.0.0 together with CXF 2.2.4. My problem is that camel-cxf pulls in many CXF poms that I do not need.
So I either have to exclude them or include them in my own project with version 2.2.4. I would rather prefer that camel-cxf only includes what it really needs.
This is the list camel-cxf includes:
      <artifactId>cxf-rt-frontend-jaxrs</artifactId>
      <artifactId>cxf-rt-core</artifactId>
      <artifactId>cxf-rt-transports-http</artifactId>
      <artifactId>cxf-rt-transports-http-jetty</artifactId>
      <artifactId>cxf-rt-transports-local</artifactId>
      <artifactId>cxf-rt-frontend-simple</artifactId>
      <artifactId>cxf-rt-frontend-jaxws</artifactId>
      <artifactId>cxf-rt-management</artifactId>
      <artifactId>cxf-tools-common</artifactId>
