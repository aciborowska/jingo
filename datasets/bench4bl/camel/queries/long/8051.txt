feature:repo-add camel 2.15-SNAPSHOT
feature:install -v camel-core
Karaf then tries to install the karaf shell console from karaf 2.4.0 which of course fails.
I first removed the reference to the karaf spring feature repo which transitively imported the karaf standard feature.
After that change it could not resolve the package:
(org.apache.felix.service.command)(version>=0.14.0)(!(version>=1.0.0)
The problem here was that we forgot status=provisional in the import.
