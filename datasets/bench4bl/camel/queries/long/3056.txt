The documentation for the Mail component (http://camel.apache.org/mail.html) indicates that the dummyTrustManager option will allow you to skip over the certificate check. Using that option in a Mail component's URI results in:

Caused by: java.io.IOException: Couldn't connect using SSL socket factory class null to host, port: my.email.server.com, -1; Exception: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.camel.component.mail.security.DummySSLSocketFactory

This is because of a decision made in CAMEL-1215 to move it to test. I think the documentation implies that this is a tool you could use (cautiously) in the development phase, and shouldn't be restricted to the unit tests. Either way, the class needs to be moved back into camel-mail.jar or the documentation needs to remove this option.
