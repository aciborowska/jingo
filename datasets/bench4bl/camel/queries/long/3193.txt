To recreate the problem you need a route with a jms inout endpoint that is configured to use a temporary destination for replies. Till now I was only able to show the problem with tibco ems.

Start broker
Start the jms consumer that replies to the request
Start the route
Send a request/reoply exchange (should work)
Stop the broker
Wait long enough for the client to do a full reconnect (I used connectionFactory.setReconnAttemptCount(1) on the client so I do not have to wait so long)
Start the broker -> The jms component will do a full new connect
Send a request/reoply exchange -> Now a InvalidDestination Exception happens

The client route will not work anymore until a restart as it creates the temporary destination only once and it is invalid now.
