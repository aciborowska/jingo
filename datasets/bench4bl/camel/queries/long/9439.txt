From a fresh install of Karaf, I add the Camel feature repository and run feature:install camel-geocoder. Using a basic geocoder endpoint, I get the following exception:



java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/gson/GsonBuilder

	at com.google.code.geocoder.Geocoder.geocode(Geocoder.java:56)

	at org.apache.camel.component.geocoder.GeoCoderProducer.process(GeoCoderProducer.java:89)

	at org.apache.camel.util.AsyncProcessorConverterHelper$ProcessorToAsyncProcessorBridge.process(AsyncProcessorConverterHelper.java:61)

	... 23 more



This appears to be caused by the feature "wrap:mvn:com.google.code.geocoder-java/geocoder-java/0.16" which uses optional for all its import packages which is incorrect as it appears to require gson (amongst other things).
A quick fix was to also install camel-gson, but this should be handled transitively.
