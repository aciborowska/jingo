camel-netty4-http does not resolve or strip out the "nettyHttpBinding" endpoint option. For example, take the following route producer:
<to uri="netty4-http:http://www.google.com:80?nettyHttpBinding=#myHttpBinding" /> 
It will issue the following HTTP GET request URI:
GET http://www.google.com:80?nettyHttpBinding=%23myHttpBinding HTTP/1.1
Assigning any of the other endpoint options, results in those options being removed from the GET request URI.
