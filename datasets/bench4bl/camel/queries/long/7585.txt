On bundle shutdown the DMLC for the temporary queue does not get discarded. When stop() is called on the request reply JmsEndpoint the runningMessageListeners.get() count returns 1 preventing to call stop on ServiceSupport. Then inside the DMLC in refreshConnectionUntilSuccessful() isRunning() gets called resulting in a JmsEndpoint isRunning() returning true from ServiceSupport.
As a quick and dirty solution one can do this on bundle shutdown:
JmsEndpoint jmsEndpoint = camelContext.getEndpoint("amq:queue:Endpoint", JmsEndpoint.class);
jmsEndpoint.onListenerContainerStopped(null);
This will decrement the runningMessageListeners (which should always be one for temp queues because a singlethreadexecuter is used) to zero allowing stop() to propagate to ServiceSupport.
