The fix applied in CAMEL-6879 causes the request headers to be sent back in the response.
DefaultRestletBinding copies the request headers in 'org.restlet.http.headers' header to the response headers in 'org.restlet.http.headers'.
This causes problems for things like Content-Type header which is a valid request and response header and so the response is sent with the request content-type. Eg, POST requests that should receive JSON in response and send using content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded will be sent back a response with the same content-type which doesn't make sense.
