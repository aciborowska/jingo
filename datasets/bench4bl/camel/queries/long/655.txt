A Jython expression used for example like this always returns null, which is now translated to false:
from("...").choice().when().jython("some expression").to(...)
For example, here's an expression that always evaluates to null/false:
request.headers['foo'] == 'bar'
To see this, look at the test PythonExpressionTest in the camel-script module.
