The test VelocityDynamicTemplateTest fails in method testVelocityLetter.
The second message the test sends contains /r/n instead of the expected /n as line break. The template letter2.vm that the test uses contains /r/n so I wonder if this test only fails on windows. I fixed the test for me by changing the expected text.
