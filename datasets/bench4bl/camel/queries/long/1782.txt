in using a private chat consumer in a route â€“ paraphrasing,
from("xmpp://server.where.ever:5222/recipient@where.ever? ...").process(...)
the first connect generally succeeds but no XMPP messages flow.
stopping later and restarting (second route) generally works properly with both connection and XMPP messages flowing.
tried with both jabber.org and talk.google.com
