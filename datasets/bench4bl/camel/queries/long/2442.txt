There's a mismatch between the explicit version constraints on the javax.activation, javax.annotation, javax.jws, javax.xml.ws etc. packages in the camel-cxf manifest and the actual version assigned to these packages by Equinox when pulled in via the system packages from the Java6 rt.jar.
This causes bundle resolution failures such as the following:

org.osgi.framework.BundleException: The bundle could not be resolved. Reason: Package uses conflict: Import-Package: org.apache.camel; version="2.2.something"


Normally this issue could be suppressed by configuring the Equinox system packages to exclude the problematic javax.* packages. However, we don't have enough control over this in pax-runner 1.3 (which unilaterally adds these packages in the generated config.ini).
The solution is to loosen the version constraints on these imports in the camel-cxf bundle manifest.
