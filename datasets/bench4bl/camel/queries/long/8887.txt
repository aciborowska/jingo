When polling from SFTP, if the exchanges are sent to asynchronous routes (seda, disruptor) many different types of exceptions happen everytime, when retrienving the content or deleting / moving / renaming the polled files.
The cause is that when routes are executed asynchronously, concurrent calls to SftpOperations are made. It looks like SftpOperations as well as ChannelSftp (Jsch) are not thread-safe. Sftp commands are either colliding, and sometime are invalid at the protocol level.
One workaround is to make SftpOperations thread-safe by making its methods synchronized.
Maybe there is another better place for a fix but i leave that to the specialists.
