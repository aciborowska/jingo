If a bundle includes a mina consumer as the one below, when you stop the bundle, the port is not released. Therefore, when restarting the bundle, you'll get a port already in use bind exception.



<from uri="mina2:tcp://0.0.0.0:12345?sync=true"/>



Note that the problem does not exist if you're using an IP address other than 0.0.0.0. For example:



<from uri="mina2:tcp://{{host.name}}:12345?sync=true"/>
