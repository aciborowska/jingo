In Jira Ticket a Issue for Camel and Swagger is described.
That ticket mentions that CDI is not affected.
Using Swagger and CDI I could reproduce the same issues like described in that ticket. 
Unfortunatley it seems to be a bit trickier as sometimes the test set up works and sometimes it fails. I could not create a example which always fails.
My example project can be found at:
https://github.com/gmixa/camelswaggerissue
The test cases always fail while the main Program,
found at 
https://github.com/gmixa/camelswaggerissue/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fundsaccess/camelcdiswaggerissue/Startup.java
 just occasionally fails.
Chances that the main program fails can be increased if this example runs in debug mode with line break points in Startup

and the example is stepped through.
The Output which I got is :
Exception org.apache.camel.FailedToStartRouteException("Failed to start route route4 because of Multiple consumers for the same endpoint is not allowed: Endpointhttp://0.0.0.0:9091/api-doc?httpMethodRestrict=GET") breakpoint hit in org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultCamelContext at line 3486 by thread main.

Any hints how i could fix that issue with cdi ?
