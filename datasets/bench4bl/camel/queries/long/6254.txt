The changeCurrentDirectory function in SftpOperations doesn't work correctly for certain combinations of state. It appears as a failure to change directory, to some directory with the first letter missing; e.g. failed to chdir to 'ploads', when current directory is '/uploads' and target directory is '/'.
The code can't work:
        if (getCurrentDirectory().startsWith(path)) {
            // use relative path
            String p = getCurrentDirectory().substring(path.length());
            if (p.length() == 0) 
{

                return;

            }
            // the first character must be '/' and hence removed
            path = UP_DIR_PATTERN.matcher(p).replaceAll("/..").substring(1);
        }
If getCurrentDirectory() is "/uploads", and path is "/", following this logic through, path will end up as "ploads". This fails later.
