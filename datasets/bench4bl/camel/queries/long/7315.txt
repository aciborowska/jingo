Java 6 ServiceLocator requires SPI resources to be encoded in UTF8 according to <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html>.
I believe Camel SPI locator should confirm to this.
Pull request with patch:
<https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/115>
Sorry for not supplying tests. Try running tests using property "file.encoding=UTF16"
