I have a netty4 tcp consumer on the from route i am able to start multiple instances of this route and there is no "address already in use/ bind exception " being raised by camel, changing the "reuseAddress" to "false" doesnt seem to make a difference.
Sample config
<from uri="netty4:tcp://0.0.0.0:3010?sync=false&textline=true&reuseAddress=false"/>
<to uri="log://org.dx.com?level=DEBUG"/>
