It is not possible to start a bundle with a camelContext in dm-server 2.0 while using camel-core version 2.2.0, because camel-core requires Spring packages of version below 3.0. This seems like an issue to me, since the release notes of version 2.2.0 suggest that it works with version 3.0 of Spring. 
Environment: Spring dm-server 2.0 (comes pre-packaged with Spring 3.0.0.RELEASE)
Steps to reproduce the problem:

start dm-server
install bundle camel-core-2.2.0.jar
install a bundle containing any kind of camelContext
Error: 
Caused by: com.springsource.kernel.osgi.framework.ExtendedClassNotFoundException: org.springframework.jmx.export.metadata.JmxAttributeSource in KernelBundleClassLoader: [bundle=org.apache.camel.camel-core_2.2.0]
(full details of stack trace have been attached)

Cause: 
The version range for the JMX spring packages in the MANIFEST.MF:
org.springframework.jmx.export.annotation;resolution:=optional;version="[2.5,3)"
,org.springframework.jmx.export.assembler;resolution:=optional;version="[2.5,3)"
,org.springframework.jmx.export.metadata;resolution:=optional;version="[2.5,3)" 
As a workaround I disabled the jmxAgent in my camel-context and changed the 
version range to [2.5,4) in the MANIFEST.MF file in my camel-core-2.2.0.jar.
I redeployed the camel-core bundle. After that my bundle started without any problems. 
Proposed solution:
Change the version range for Spring packages in camel-core from [2.5,3) to [2.5,4)
