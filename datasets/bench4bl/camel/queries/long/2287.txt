Splitter supports filtering exchanges when a filter is used inside it.
However it should clear the filtered flag for exchanges arriving in, before the splitting so Camel has no memory in case filter has been used before the splitter

                Predicate goodWord = body().contains("World");

                from("direct:start")
                    .to("mock:before")
                    .filter(goodWord)
                        .to("mock:good")
                    .end()
                    .split(body().tokenize(" "), new MyAggregationStrategy())
                        .to("mock:split")
                    .end()
                    .to("mock:result");
