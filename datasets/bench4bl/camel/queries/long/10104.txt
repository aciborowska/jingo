Using the mail consumer with the quartz scheduler like
imap://myhost?scheduler=quartz2&scheduler.cron=0%2F5+0-23%3F+&scheduler.timeZone=Europe%2FBerlin
leads to an error:
"There are 2 scheduler parameters that couldn't be set on the endpoint. Check the uri if the parameters are spelt correctly and that they are properties of the endpoint."
