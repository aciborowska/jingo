getting the endpoint URI of an HTTP EndPoint with httpClient.soTimeout property set won't return the property
i.e: "http://crive.optadev.com/valde/utils/posttest.php?httpClient.soTimeout=5000" is returned as "http://crive.optadev.com/valde/utils/posttest.php"

I have noticed this using ExchangeHelper.resolveEndpoint:
String uri = "http://crive.optadev.com/valde/utils/posttest.php?httpClient.soTimeout=5000";
uri = ExchangeHelper.resolveEndpoint(exchange, uri.trim()).getEndpointUri();
//uri is now missing httpClient.soTimeout=5000


it is also happening reading @Header(Exchange.TO_ENDPOINT)

this is not happening when using the soTimeout option in FTP component.
I think this is a major issue as recipientList is making use of ExchangeHelper and therefore the option will be ingored.
