It barfs with the following error:
[INFO] The projects in the reactor contain a cyclic reference: Edge between 'Vertex

The problem is that the parent pom defines the checkstyle plugin and defines a dependency on buildtools.  So when maven tries to buid buildtools, it has a dependency on itself because it is inherited from  the parent pom.
A fix would be to define a "parent" module.   The root pom would not define the checkstyle plugin, but this definition would be in the parent module.  The buildtool module would directly inherit from the root pom, while all other modules inherit from the "parent" pom.
