CxfRsEndpoint doesn't support custom feture support like
org.apache.camel.component.cxf.CxfEndpoint.setFeatures(List<AbstractFeature>)
org.apache.camel.component.cxf.jaxrs.CxfRsEndpoint.createJAXRSClientFactoryBean() can't be used for additional configuration because org.apache.camel.component.cxf.jaxrs.CxfRsProducer.ClientFactoryBeanCache used
in case bus was initialized with required features they aren't initialized for WebClient
