In MockEndpoint.assertIsSatisfied(), don't use the right counter for assertion.

      
      if (expectedMinimumCount >= 0) {
            int receivedCounter = getReceivedCounter();
            assertTrue("Received message count " + receivedCounter + ", expected at least " + expectedCount, expectedCount <= receivedCounter);
        }


it should be change to 

      
      if (expectedMinimumCount >= 0) {
            int receivedCounter = getReceivedCounter();
            assertTrue("Received message count " + receivedCounter + ", expected at least " + expectedMinimumCount, expectedMinimumCount <= receivedCounter);
        }
