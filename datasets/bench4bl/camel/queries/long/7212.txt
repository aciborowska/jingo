If Bean Validator is deployed into OSGi container (like Karaf), it should use OSGi-friendly ValidationProviderResolver.
We should detect the type of the current CamelContext and if the latter is OSGi-aware, and if ValidationProviderResolver isn't specified explicitly, then we should use HibernateValidationProviderResolver (which is OSGi-friendly).
