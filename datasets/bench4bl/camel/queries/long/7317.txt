When OBR resolver is available, If the bundle in features.xml has dependency="true" means if there's on other bundle in this feature explicitly depend on this bundle than it won't get installed, so xml-specs-api feature shouldn't have all bundles marked as dependency="true",
We should remove dependency="true" for woodstox and jaxb-impl bundles
