If conversion fails it could be hard to understand what is a problem because it returns just a message "Conversion has fallen back to generic Object -> DBObject, but unable to convert type {}. Returning null" that points to a class that was not converted.
In case of, as example, if a list of objects that should be converted leads to a memory error because of parent-child link are cycled for 2 objects, it would take a lot of efforts to understand what is going on. And information about underlying exception, stackoverflow in this case, could help to find the root cause much faster than now.
