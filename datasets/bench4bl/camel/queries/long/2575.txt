CXFRS Routing in Camel 2.0.0 works  well with these endPoints:
<cxf:rsServer id="restRouter" address="/restRouter/"	
      serviceClass="com.project.service.impl.ServiceManagerImpl"   />
     <cxf:rsClient id="restEndpoint" address="http://localhost:8080/services/rest"
      serviceClass="com.project.service.impl.ServiceManagerImpl" />
In Camel 2.2.0, Routing fails with error causing the CXF Client to invoke a 404 not found Rest Service which is 'http://localhost:8080/services/rest/restRouter/Path'.
The address of cxf:rsClient is being appended by the cxf:rsServer's address
