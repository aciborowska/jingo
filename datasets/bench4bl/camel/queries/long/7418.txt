I guess this line isn't correct:
if (type.isInstance(pair.getClass()) || type.getName().equals(pair.getClassName()))
The variable "pair.getClass()" always returns "javax.naming.NameClassPair" or its subclasses and the method "isInstance" works only with Instances, but doesnt Classes.
 I think the correct code should be:
if (type.isAssignableFrom(Class.forName(pair.getClassName())))
I've tried to test a transacted route, but i couldnt because the error: 
Failed to create route route1 at: >>> Transacted[] <<< in route: Route(route1)[[From[direct:start]] -> [Transacted[]]] because of No bean could be found in the registry of type: PlatformTransactionManager
