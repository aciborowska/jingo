The change (r979549) made by CAMEL-2991 causes every single endpoint to be recreated instead of restarted which takes Camel a (quite big) step back.  It is bad for the following reasons:
1) recreating services associated could be expensive (the design should not assume recreating the services is cheap).
2) states (if any) in Endpoint/Service could not be preserved (stop does not mean destroy after all).   
3) it is unnecessary to recreate to the whole shebank and it is an unexpected behavior for the users.  (Users think stop but it is gone.)
In the code (DefaultCamelContext.doStartCamel()), one can clearly see the original intent of the author (who even bothered to put in a nice comment) is to avoid re-initialization the route definition after stopping the camel context.  (Well, things may change but not necessarily for the better.)

       // To avoid initiating the routeDefinitions after stopping the camel context
        if (!routeDefinitionInitiated) {
            startRouteDefinitions(routeDefinitions);
            routeDefinitionInitiated = true;
        }


But, the change simply reset the routeDefinitionInitiated flag in doStop() which is the exact opposite of the original intention and routeDefinitionInitiated is unless pretty much.
