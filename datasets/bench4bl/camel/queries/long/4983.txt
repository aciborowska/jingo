The bindy csv component uses the default encoding when importing a file.
In Detail:
Class org.apache.camel.dataformat.bindy.csv.BindyCsvDataFormat Line 115:

InputStreamReader in = new InputStreamReader(inputStream);
+ InputStreamReader in = new InputStreamReader(inputStream, IOConverter.getCharsetName(exchange));

the marshal method needs that fix probably too. This was already done for the standard CSV component:
