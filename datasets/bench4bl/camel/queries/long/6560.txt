The java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 0, Size: 0 exception is thrown, if select statement returns empty result.
The correction is already made in version 2.12.0, see issue CAMEL-6157, but this 'Parametrized queries in JDBC component' issue looks as more complex. 
It will be nice to fix only this exception in version 2.11.2. I attached the extended JdbcRSMetaDataTest.java and fixed JdbcProducer.java as patch (based on tag camel-2.11.1).
