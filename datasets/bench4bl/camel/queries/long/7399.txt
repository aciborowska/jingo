An upgrade to XStream version has broken the alias cache manipulation in XmlRestProcessor. Earlier versions of XStream used to only throw a ClassNotFoundException when CachingMapper.realClass call failed to find a mapped class, but recent versions now add the exception to its cache. This makes it imperative that the cache be flushed when no real class is found. As a result, the cache lookup optimization now only avoids flushing in case the alias mapping hasn't changed, which still works for repeated invocation of the same endpoint which requires using an XML alias for Salesforce's RESTish API.
