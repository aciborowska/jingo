When writing the following code, the expression 

${headers.true} == ${headers.true}

 evaluates to false - rather than the expected true.



    <camelContext trace="false" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">

        <route>

            <from uri="direct:entry"/>



            <setHeader headerName="true">

                <constant>true</constant>

            </setHeader>



            <setBody>

                <simple resultType="java.lang.Boolean">${headers.true} == ${headers.true}</simple>

            </setBody>



            <log message="The expression evaluated to :: ${body}" />



        </route>

    </camelContext>






[                          main] route1                         INFO  The expression evaluated to :: false



Edit: I have tried debugging this, and it seems that the "==" token is being treated as a LiteralExpression - rather than an being a Binary Operator? I'm imaging therefore that the `false` is purely from coercing a String to the java.lang.Boolean resultType?
