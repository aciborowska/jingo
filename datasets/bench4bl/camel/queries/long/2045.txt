The artifact coming from the maven central repo doesn't contain the @org.apache.camel.MessageDriven annotation.
This annotation is still in the javadoc, so I assume it hasn't been removed?
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
	<artifactId>camel-core</artifactId>
	<version>2.0.0</version>
	<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
