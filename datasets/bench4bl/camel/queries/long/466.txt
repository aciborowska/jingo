If you don't do a "mvn clean" before generating the apache-camel distribution you may get an error that looks like:
Embedded error: duplicate entry: org/apache/camel/component/mina/MinaComponent$1$1.class
Folk have seen several other duplicate entries popping up here as well... it is the maven-shade-plugin thats barfing.
