Configuration of multiple URIs for the same method in a REST service containing wildcards and fixed parts does not work. Example: 



<get uri="/{uuid}/meta" ...>

<get uri="/{uuid}/{channel}" ...>



This causes ServletRestServletResolveConsumerStrategy.java to identify 2 
consumerPath candidates (lines 70-77), which isn't handled afterwords (line 80). It probably should use the most specific one in this case.
