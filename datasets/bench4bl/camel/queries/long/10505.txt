Option "readLock=rename" (according to htttp://camel.apache.org/file2.html) is necessary to lock work file in case of it is not used by another application. But currently we see "FileNotFound" during test rename operation and "FILE" component tries to lock and process corresponding work file.
This issue can be resolved by wrapping of corresponding rename operation by try-catch block. See diff.txt for "camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/file/strategy/GenericFileRenameExclusiveReadLockStrategy.java" in attachment which shows way to correct current issue.
Similar issue is applicable for previous Camel version also.
