Found a possible issue when working with camel and trying to move a file after it has finished processing, It appears that camel tries to close the file to early before the split has finished with the file 
I have attached images of where i am finding this problem, In the image "Where the problem occurs.png" camel tries to close the file the first time at this point?
The rather ugly hack is on the close method of the iiterator
