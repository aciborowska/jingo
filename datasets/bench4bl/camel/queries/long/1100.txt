if I use the following spring-xml, the exceptions from 'converter1' get swallowed, and nothing is logged.
As soons as the multicast-tag is removed, the exception appears in the logfile.
Using <multicast parallelProcessing=true> made no difference.
<route>
	<from ref="queueA" />
	<bean ref="mapper" method="map" />
	<multicast>
		<pipeline>
			<bean ref="converter1" method="convert" />
			<to ref="TopicB" />
		</pipeline>
		<pipeline>
			<bean ref="DBpersister" method="onMessage" />
		</pipeline>
	</multicast>
</route>
