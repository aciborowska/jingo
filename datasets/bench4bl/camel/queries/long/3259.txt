On the http://camel.apache.org/component.html, the link to the CamelContext class JavaDoc point to the old http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/CamelContext.html URL, which is a dead link. There some additional dead links to other JavaDoc items.
Same issue on the following pages :
http://camel.apache.org/camelcontext.html
http://camel.apache.org/error-handler.html
