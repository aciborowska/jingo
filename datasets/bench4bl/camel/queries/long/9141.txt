Apparently, Salesforce released a patch to all their non prod env's over the weekend and that has busted the camel components login.
Here is the error - 
Caused by: org.codehaus.jackson.map.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException: Unrecognized field "is_readonly" (Class org.apache.camel.component.salesforce.internal.dto.LoginToken), not marked as ignorable
 at [Source: [B@3112c01a; line: 1, column: 147] (through reference chain: org.apache.camel.component.salesforce.internal.dto.LoginToken["is_readonly"])
I've submitted a pull request - 
https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/615
I've tested it against https://test.salesforce.com, however its worth testing against https://login.salesforce.com
