See here (not created by myself, but I experienced the same issue with camel-ahc) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40262870/camel-ahc-ws-netty-runtime-exception/40528271#40528271
I see errors like:



java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: io.netty.buffer.ByteBuf.forEachByte(Lio/netty/buffer/ByteBufProcessor;)



When I'm sending http requests via camel-ahc.
A workaround for me is to exclude netty-all 4.1.5 and use netty-all 4.0.41.Final instead
Since there is no version of AsyncHttpClient out there which directly support 4.1.5 I'm not sure how to handle this if you need both camel-ahc and camel-netty (or whatever else is making direct use of netty 4.1.5)
