Looks like a copy/paste error is preventing the grouping functionality from being executed by the helper object. 
group should be passed to the delegate's tokenize method. 
camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/builder/ExpressionClause.java 
    /** 

Evaluates a token expression on the message body

@param token the token
@param regex whether the token is a regular expression or not
@param group to group by the given number
@return the builder to continue processing the DSL
     */ 
    public T tokenize(String token, boolean regex, int group) 
{ 

        return delegate.tokenize(token, regex); 

    }
