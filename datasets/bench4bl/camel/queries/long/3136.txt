... this makes it impossible to inject properties to the @WebService class
<camelContext>
        <route>
            <from uri="...." />
            <to uri="cxfbean:handler" />
        </route>
</camelContext>
<bean id="handler" class="a.b.c.Handler">
        <property name="prop1" value="5" />
</bean>
when "handler" is created by Spring, its 'prop1' is set to '5'
when the cxfbean:handler is triggered, the 'prop1' is null, because CXF created another instance of Handler instead of using the one created by Spring
