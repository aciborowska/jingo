In came-quartz route after bundle update jobs are not triggred.
I created a small example for camel-quartz with persistence(Quatz mysql database). My blueprint.xml looks like
<route id="CamelQuartzExampleRoute">
      <from uri="CamelQuartzJob" />
      <setBody>
          <method ref="helloBean" method="hello"/>
      </setBody>
      <log message="The message contains $
{body}
"/>
      <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>
In the above route I used property placeholder CamelQuartzJob for quartz uri and its value is configured from a configuration file. I deployed this example in jboss fuse and it worked as expected means the job is stored in quartz database and triggered for every 30 seconds. The actual issue is
1.    I changed the quartz uri value configured in configuration file from CamelQuartzJob= quartz://DeleteRecord/DeleteRecordTimer?cron=0/30+?&stateful=true to CamelQuartzJob= quartz://DeleteRecord/DeleteRecordTimer?cron=0/60+?&stateful=true and then did a bundle update for that example project.
2.    The bundle started successfully but the scheduled job is not started for every 60 seconds. From fuse logs  I could see
12:13:00,014 | WARN  | heduler_Worker-1 | CamelJob                         | 261 - org.apache.camel.camel-quartz - 2.10.0.redhat-60024 | Cannot find existing QuartzEndpoint with uri: quartz://DeleteRecord/DeleteRecordTimer?cron=0%2F30+%3F&stateful=true. Creating new endpoint instance.
I believe in camel-quartz we have to use route id or the endpoint id in the quartz database instead of the URI. But not sure about the root cause. Please guide me?
