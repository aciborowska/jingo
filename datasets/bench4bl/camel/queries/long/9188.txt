In Camel SNMP, the org.apache.camel.component.snmp.SnmpConverters
class has a static “getXmlSafeString” method which escapes unsafe
characters by replacing them. However, the order of applying
replacements is not correct:
    private static String getXmlSafeString(String string) 
{



        return string.replaceAll("<", "<").replaceAll(">",

">").replaceAll("&", "&").replaceAll("\"",

""").replaceAll("'", "&apos");



    }

It replaces “<” with “<” at first, then the “&” is replaced with
“&”. This means that a “<” character in the input string will be
changed to “<”, and then into “&lt;”, which is not the intended
behavior.
This could be fixed by applying the “replaceAll("&", "&")”
transformation first.
