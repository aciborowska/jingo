Dozer assumes that it can load user types from the classloader of the dozer implementation, which is of course quite wrong in a modular environment. In Camel we have a hack in DozerTypeConverterLoader, which prior to creating the bean mapper forces the classLoaderBeanName in GlobalSettings to DozerThreadContextClassLoader and then initialises the TCCL with the application ClassLoader associated with the CamelContext.
With a spring based context, this code path is not executed and therefore the application ClassLoader associated with the CamelContext ignored.
