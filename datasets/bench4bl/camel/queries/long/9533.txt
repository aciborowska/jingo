When I specify a responseModel in a rest responseMessage definition like so:



rest().put("{accountNumber}")

  .responseMessage()

    .code(HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK)

    .message("Account was successfully updated.")

    .responseModel(AccountDetails.class)

  .endResponseMessage()

  .to("direct:foo");



I get the following Swagger API fragment:



"responses": {

  "200": {

    "description": "Account was successfully updated."

  }

}



However, if I specify the response model as the outType instead, I get a fragment like this instead:



"responses": {

  "200": {

    "description": "Account was successfully updated.",

    "schema": {

      "$ref": "#/definitions/AccountDetails"

    }

  }

}



Doing it the latter way means I can't specify different out types for different status codes. It's only added to the 200 status code as far as I can tell.
