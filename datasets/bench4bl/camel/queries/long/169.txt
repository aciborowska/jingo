The release candidate seems to declare dependencies on camel-core 1.1-SNAPSHOT.  A release should not declare dependencies on SNAPSHOT version and also not on previous releases.
http://people.apache.org/~chirino/apache-camel-1.2.0-RC1/maven2/org/apache/camel/camel-parent/1.2.0/camel-parent-1.2.0.pom
I checked out 1.2.0 from tags and build it myself.  I noticed that there were some 1.1 SNAPSHOT versions but did not pay too much attention to it.  I then deployed to our internal Maven repository and clean-up my local repository.  I had a dependency to camel-core 1.2.0 declared in my project.  This give me the following error:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.camel.util.CamelContextHelper.convertTo(Lorg/apache/camel/CamelContext;Ljava/lang/Class;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
If I remove the dependency I get the following compilation error:
Missing:
----------
1) org.apache.camel:camel-core:jar:1.1-SNAPSHOT
  Try downloading the file manually from the project website.
  Then, install it using the command:
      mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.apache.camel -DartifactId=camel-core \
          -Dversion=1.1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/file
Alternatively, if you host your own repository you can deploy the file there:       mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=org.apache.camel -DartifactId=camel
-core \
          -Dversion=1.1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/file \
           -Durl=[url] -DrepositoryId=[id]
  Path to dependency:
        1) markettools.platform:messaging:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT
        2) org.apache.camel:camel-jms:jar:1.2.0
        3) org.apache.camel:camel-core:jar:1.1-SNAPSHOT
----------
1 required artifact is missing.
