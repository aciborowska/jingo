If you send to a VM endpoint from one route and consume from the same endpoint in another route, but include an argument on only one of the routes, Camel sees them as two different routes.  Therefore, the messages are never consumed.  For example:
<camelContext id="sendNotifyContext"
	xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring"
	errorHandlerRef="errorHandler">
      <route id="sendToNotify">
            <from uri="..." />
            ....
<to uri="vm:myNotify" />
      </route>
</camelContext>
<camelContext id="receiveNotifyContext"
	xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring"
	errorHandlerRef="errorHandler">
      <route id="receiveNotify">
<from uri="vm:myNotify?size=2500" />
            ....
            <to uri="..." />
      </route>
</camelContext>
The producer appears to send to vm:myNotify while the consumer is listening to a separate endpoint named vm:myNotify?size=2500, so the messages build up and are never received.
