Netty4 producer is reusing connections and implementing a request-response style protocol. If the server closes socket connection after reading request packet and prior to sending back response packet, Netty4 producer hangs. If, on the other hand, the server closes socket after sending back response and does not bother to read next request, then producer does not hang.
