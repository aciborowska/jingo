Documentation for the camel-jcr component indicates that the repository username and password can be provided on the endpoint URI as jcr://user:pass@repository/path.  The JcrEndpoint class does not parse these correctly, however â€“ URI.getUserInfo() returns "user:pass", and URI.getAuthority() returns "user:pass@repository" as per the javadocs for java.net.URI and RFC-2396.
