[11:26am] MartinCleaver: ok, well I did build it against trunk, I used "svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-gae camel-example-gae"
[11:26am] MartinCleaver: but the pom.xml didn't work for me
[11:27am] MartinCleaver: maybe I installed google app engine incorrectly, the instructions felt vague
[11:27am] joed: You are buidling a snapshot, you don't have any of the parent pom deps, you'll need the whole source tree most likely.
[11:29am] MartinCleaver: ah - is this mentioned on http://camel.apache.org/tutorial-for-camel-on-google-app-engine.html ? I should have checked out google app engine rather than just a "Install the http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html"
[11:31am] MartinCleaver: and, did installing google app engine not install the parent pom deps?
[11:33am] joed: I just tried that too and that also works fine with mvn clean install
[11:33am] MartinCleaver: ok, so I've screwed up somewhere.
[11:33am] tjsnell: you have snapshot in your repo already though
[11:33am] tjsnell: hrmm
[11:33am] joed: True.
[11:34am] joed: One sec.
[11:34am] tjsnell: trying a clean repo?
[11:34am] MartinCleaver: I was surprised I needed to edit the pom.xml file, but perhaps that's just my naivety
[11:35am] joed: Yeah, those instructions won't work.
[11:35am] MartinCleaver: ah!
[11:36am] â€¢ MartinCleaver feels a little vindicated, but mostly thankful
[11:36am] tjsnell: heh
[11:36am] joed: MartinCleaver: you are right, since you followed the instructions - the example gets the null: basically because you have the project only and no the parent poms.
[11:36am] joed: not*
[11:36am] tjsnell: can he set the version to a realeased version not snapshot?
[11:37am] tjsnell: should pull the poms then right?
[11:38am] joed: If you were to build against trunk, it'll work fine
[11:38am] joed: tjsnell: Don't think so, since properties/version/parent/etc still is missing.
[11:39am] tjsnell: ahh
[11:39am] tjsnell: yeah
[11:39am] joed: MartinCleaver: the quickest fix is this : svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk camel ; cd camel/examples/camel-example-gae ; mvn clean install
[11:40am] joed: We need to improve the wiki page though.
