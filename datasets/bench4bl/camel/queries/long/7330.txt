Hello,
After taking a short look at the Consumer for the kafka component, it appears that the consumer never fills the camel message body with the kafka message received.
I fixed it on master but i think this is major enough to be backported to camel 2.13.1.
Here is the link to the pull request  : https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/120
Thank you.
Fabien
