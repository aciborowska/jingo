I used netty4 and netty4http as producer ,when occurs  exception "Connection reset by peer",netty4 client's EventLoopGroup "Selector" thread and related port won't shut down.I used thread dump and found ClientChannelHandler's method exceptionCaught just close channel,it won't close "Selector" thread and port, and the same to NettyProducer.NettyProducerPoolableObjectFactory.destroyObject.
