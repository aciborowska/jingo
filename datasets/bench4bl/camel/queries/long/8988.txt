Using org.quartz.Scheduler.triggerJob to manually trigger jobs will result in an exception like:
2015-07-20 16:17:28,295 [amel-1_Worker-1] ERROR CamelJob                       - Failed to execute CamelJob.
org.apache.camel.ResolveEndpointFailedException: Failed to resolve endpoint: quartz2://MyTimer?cron=05+00+00+%3F due to: Trigger key Camel.MyTimer is already in use by Endpoint[quartz2://MyTimer?cron=05+00+00+*+*+%3F]
Problem is that CamelJob is having trouble with looking up the proper endpoint from a previously saved URI.
