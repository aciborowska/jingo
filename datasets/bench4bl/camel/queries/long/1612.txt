When defining routes in two camel contexts the endpoints are not correctly assigned to the contexts. The bug can easily be observed by using jconsole / jmx. For one camel context the endpoints are not registered.
From debugging up to InstrumentationLifecycleStrategy#onEndpointAdd(Endpoint) it looks like the order of starting contexts and registering endpoints is wrong. (Camel tries to add endpoints with this method to one context before (initialized) and so the endpoints are not really added. It looks like the reason for this is in the order of initializing contexts and routes/endpoints.)
