The ASF mirror systems only holds releases that are current; in the case of Camel that is currently 2.11.4 and 2.12.3. All other releases are available on the archive server.
However, all of the superseded release download pages still point to the ASF mirror system. Their links are broken.
For example, in the download page for 2.12.2, instead of 
http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/camel/apache-camel/2.12.2/apache-camel-2.12.2.zip
and
http://www.apache.org/dist/camel/apache-camel/2.12.2/apache-camel-2.12.2.zip.asc
the page should point to
http://archive.apache.org/dist/camel/apache-camel/2.11.2/apache-camel-2.11.2.zip
and
http://archive.apache.org/dist/camel/apache-camel/2.12.2/apache-camel-2.12.2.zip.asc
