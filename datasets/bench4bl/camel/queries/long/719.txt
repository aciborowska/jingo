since CAMEL-709 add getBody method to CxfMessage, so the code in CxfBinding.createCxfMessage()
Object body = in.getBody(InputStream.class); will never always return InputStream object, which means the code will never run into the case that the message body is List.class, but it will break the logic when the MESSAGEFORMAT is POJO for camel-cxf, so we need try to getBody(List.class) firstly to fix it
