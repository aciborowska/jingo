The docs at http://camel.apache.org/jdbc.html state 

This component can not be used as a Transactional Client. If you need transaction support in your route, you should use the SQL component instead.
This statement however seems to be wrong. 
I have a demo at https://github.com/tmielke/fuse-demos/tree/master/Camel/Camel-JMS-JDBC-XA-TX that uses the camel-jdbc component in an XA transaction scenario without errors.
Can someone please confirm the docs is wrong and I can correct it in the docs?
