Something happened so the features.xml now has a hardcoded karaf version
This is from the generated source code:



<features xmlns="http://karaf.apache.org/xmlns/features/v1.0.0" name='camel-2.15-SNAPSHOT'>

  <repository>mvn:org.apache.karaf.assemblies.features/spring/2.4.0/xml/features</repository>



Notice how it says karaf 2.4.0. 
I suspect it was some spring stuff that was changed. We need to either revert or find some way for Camel to support Karaf 2.x and 3.x at the same time.
