Update these features to use the servicemix bundle wrapping htmlunit. It is currently incorrectly named as httpunit. So a request has been logged in a comment for SMX4-1816. 
Once the name is corrected, the features should be updated to use the smx4 bundle instead of the wrapped jars, which sometimes leads to CNF exceptions at runtime.
