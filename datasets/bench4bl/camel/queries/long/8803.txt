The Maven artifact camel-jetty9 depends on org.apache.geronimo.specs:geronimo-servlet_3.0_spec.
camel-jetty9 also depends on org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server:jar:9.2.9.v20150224, which further depends on javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:jar:3.1.0
The dependencies of camel-jetty9 include thus two conflicting and different versions of several classes. Both the Servlet API 3.0 version and Servlet API 3.1 version are included as (transitive) dependencies.
Instead of depending on the geronimo artifact, couldn't camel-jetty9 just depend on the servlet-api artifact (of the correct version)?
