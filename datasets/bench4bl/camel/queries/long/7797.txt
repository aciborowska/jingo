 Code already pushed. Creating this ticket for change tracking purposes â€“ so that it appears on release notes.
DefaultCxfRsBinding is using the wrong directionality when applying the header filter strategy. The method copyProtocolHeaders is used when turning an incoming CXF payload into a Camel exchange/message. 
However, it was calling the Header Filter Strategy's applyFilterToCamelHeaders instead of applyFilterToExternalHeaders.
