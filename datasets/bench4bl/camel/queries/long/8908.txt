Camel-kafka component (2.15.1) gives a NullPointer exception in NotifyBuilder causing our assertions to fail.
The error seems to be due to the fact that the Exchange created by the component has fromEndPoint set to null.
In KafkaEndpoint.java
   public Exchange createKafkaExchange(MessageAndMetadata<byte[], byte[]> mm) {
        Exchange exchange = new DefaultExchange(getCamelContext(), getExchangePattern());
I believe this should be instantiated as 
Exchange exchange = new DefaultExchange(this, getExchangePattern());
