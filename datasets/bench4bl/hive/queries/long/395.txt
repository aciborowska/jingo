Compile error with Hadoop 0.19.1:
The method validateInput(JobConf) is undefined for the type InputFormat
HiveInputFormat.java	hive-trunk/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io
line 241
The ant build apparently hacks around this with the "[exclude_0_19]" comment. Easy to just comment this line out for now, but a proper fix would be nice eventually.
