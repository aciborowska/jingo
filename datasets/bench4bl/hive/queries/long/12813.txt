1) Due to YARN-4562, we should package ssl-server.xml if available; SSL settings are not  read from LLAP configs.
2) The bean removal can fail during shutdown.
3) LlapWebServices creates its own config object but uses the one provided by AbstractService instead.
4) Setting name for ACL is used by Hadoop to generate the setting name for the host list, which happens to collide with the existing LLAP host list setting name, resulting in all hosts being prevented from connecting to daemon protocol.
