The daemons currently prints GC details. It will be useful to print the total useful time application spent and the total time for which application threads are stopped.
Need to add



-XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime -XX:+PrintGCApplicationConcurrentTime



to get something like



Application time: 0.3440086 seconds

Total time for which application threads were stopped: 0.0620105 seconds

Application time: 0.2100691 seconds

Total time for which application threads were stopped: 0.0890223 seconds
