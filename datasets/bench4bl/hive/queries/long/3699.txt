I am doing a query with multiple INSERT OVERWRITE to multiple tables in order to scan the dataset only 1 time, and i end up having all these tables with the same content ! It seems the GROUP BY query that returns results is overwriting all the temp tables.
Weird enough, if i had further GROUP BY queries into additional temp tables, grouped by a different field, then all temp tables, even the ones that would have been wrong content are all correctly populated.
This is the misbehaving query:
    FROM nikon
    INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE e1
    SELECT qs_cs_s_aid AS Emplacements, COUNT AS Impressions
    WHERE qs_cs_s_cat='PRINT' GROUP BY qs_cs_s_aid
    INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE e2
    SELECT qs_cs_s_aid AS Emplacements, COUNT AS Vues
    WHERE qs_cs_s_cat='VIEW' GROUP BY qs_cs_s_aid
    ;
It launches only one MR job and here are the results. Why does table 'e1' contains results from table 'e2' ?! Table 'e1' should have been empty (see individual SELECTs further below)
    hive> SELECT * from e1;
    OK
    NULL    2
    1627575 25
    1627576 70
    1690950 22
    1690952 42
    1696705 199
    1696706 66
    1696730 229
    1696759 85

    hive> SELECT * from e2;
    OK
    NULL    2
    1627575 25
    1627576 70
    1690950 22
    1690952 42
    1696705 199
    1696706 66
    1696730 229
    1696759 85

Here is are the result to the indiviual queries (only the second query returns a result set):
    hive> SELECT qs_cs_s_aid AS Emplacements, COUNT AS Impressions FROM nikon
    WHERE qs_cs_s_cat='PRINT' GROUP BY qs_cs_s_aid;
    (...)
    OK
          <- There are no results, this is normal

    hive> SELECT qs_cs_s_aid AS Emplacements, COUNT AS Vues FROM nikon
    WHERE qs_cs_s_cat='VIEW' GROUP BY qs_cs_s_aid;
    (...)
    OK
    NULL  2
    1627575 25
