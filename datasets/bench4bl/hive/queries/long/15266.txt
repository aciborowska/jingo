In HIVE-15226 ( https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-15226 ), blobstore tests were changed to print a different masking pattern for the blobstore path. In that patch, test output was replaced for the clientpositive test ( insert_into.q ), but not for the clientnegative test ( select_dropped_table.q ), causing the negative tests to fail.
This patch is the result of -Dtest.output.overwrite=true with the clientnegative tests.
