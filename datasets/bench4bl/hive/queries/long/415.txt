select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL



select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL



select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL



select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL

select 1 from mytable UNION ALL



select 1 from mytable UNION ALL
