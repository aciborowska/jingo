About 80MB held after 7 hours of running. Metrics2Collector aggregates only when it's invoked by the Hadoop sink.
Options - the first one is better IMO.
1. Fix Metrics2Collector to aggregate more often, and fix the dependency in Hive accordingly
2. Don't setup the metrics sub-system if a sink is not configured.
