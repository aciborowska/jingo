Embedded metastore clients can't be retried, they throw an exception - "For direct MetaStore DB connections, we don't support retries at the client level."
This tends to mask the real error that caused the attempts to retry. RetryingMetaStoreClient shouldn't even attempt to reconnect when direct/embedded metastore client is used.
