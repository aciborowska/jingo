Dynamic Partition insert showing an error with the number of partitions created even after the default value of 'hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions' is bumped high to 2000.
Error Message:
"Failed with exception Number of dynamic partitions created is 1413, which is more than 1000. To solve this try to set hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions to at least 1413."
These are the following properties set on hive CLI
hive> set hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
hive> set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;
hive> set hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions=2000;
hive> set hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions.pernode=2000;
This is the query with console error log

FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.MoveTask
I checked the job.xml of the first map only job, there the value hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions=2000 is reflected but the move task is taking the default value from hive-site.xml . If I change the value in hive-site.xml then the job completes successfully. Bottom line,the property 'hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions'set on CLI is not being considered by move task
