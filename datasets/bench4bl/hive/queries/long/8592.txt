I am trying to load zero values into Hive Decimal fields into a Hive table where the precision and scale are defined as the same e.g. DECIMAL(1,1) or DECIMAL(3,3) etc...
However every time I run a hive ql insert statement to do this containing zero values or run a LOAD DATA command to load a text file of data containing zero values to these columns / fields, on performing a query on the table, these zero values are displayed and treated as NULL values.
On further investigation, I was able to narrow the problem down to doing simple selects with casts. See example and output from Hive below. So attempting to do a cast for 0 or 0.0 or '.0' to DECIMAL(1,1) NULL is returned instead of 0. This is the same for precisions 1-38 where the scale is also the same
If there is a work around for this then please let me know. Thanks!
hive> select cast('.0' as DECIMAL(1,1)), cast('0.0' as DECIMAL(1,1)), cast('0' as DECIMAL(1,1)), cast(0 as DECIMAL(1,1)), cast(0.0 as DECIMAL(1,1));
