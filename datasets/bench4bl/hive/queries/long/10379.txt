I do a left join with a lateral view outer , too many row are generated with tez .
in map reduce , i have 125 rows , in tez 132 .....
Example :

  drop table foo ;



  create table foo ( dummyfoo int  ) ;

  insert into table foo select count(*) from foo ;



  select count(*) as cnt from (

      select a.val,p.code from

                        ( select cast((((one*5)+two)*5+three) as int) as val from foo

                                        lateral view outer explode(split("0,1,2,3,4",",")) tbl_1 as one

                                        lateral view outer explode(split("0,1,2,3,4",",")) tbl_2 as two

                                        lateral view outer explode(split("0,1,2,3,4",",")) tbl_3 as three ) as a

                        left join

                        ( select dummyfoo as code from foo ) p on p.code=a.val

  ) w ;



  set hive.execution.engine=tez;

  set hive.vectorized.execution.enabled=false;



  select count(*) as cnt from (

      select a.val,p.code from

                        ( select cast((((one*5)+two)*5+three) as int) as val from foo

                                        lateral view outer explode(split("0,1,2,3,4",",")) tbl_1 as one

                                        lateral view outer explode(split("0,1,2,3,4",",")) tbl_2 as two

                                        lateral view outer explode(split("0,1,2,3,4",",")) tbl_3 as three ) as a

                        left join

                        ( select dummyfoo as code from foo ) p on p.code=a.val

  ) w ;
