When creating partitions in a table using dynamic partitions and a Block level merge is executed at the end of the query, some partitions may be lost.  Specifically if the values of two or more dynamic partition keys end in the same sequence of numbers, all but the largest will be dropped.
I was not able to confirm it, but I suspect that if a map reduce job is speculated as part of the merge, the duplicate data will not be deleted either.
E.g.
insert overwrite table merge_dynamic_part partition (ds = '2008-04-08', hr)
select key, value, if(key % 2 == 0, 'a1', 'b1') as hr from srcpart_merge_dp_rc where ds = '2008-04-08';
In this query, if a Block level merge is executed at the end, only one of the partitions ds=2008-04-08/hr=a1 and ds=2008-04-08/hr=b1 will appear in the final table.
