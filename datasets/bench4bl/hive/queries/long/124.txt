The query  "SELECT COUNT(1) FROM f_status_update fsu WHERE FALSE" should return a single row with value 0.
Our code treat that query as "SELECT 1, COUNT(1) FROM f_status_update fsu WHERE FALSE GROUP BY 1", but these 2 queries are not equivalent because the second query will return empty result if the input is empty.
