In CommonJoinOperator, RowContainer is created for each input table with the SerDe and ObjectInspector to serialize/deserialize that row to persistent storage. The serde/OI could be null in the case of the value columns are pruned by column pruner. An example query is
select count(1) from A join B on A.key=B.key;
Another case of mismatch is that the tableDesc was initialized at compile time before the column pruner take place. This could cause inconsistency in the SerDe/OI with the input data. This should be moved to execution time when the join operator is initialized.
