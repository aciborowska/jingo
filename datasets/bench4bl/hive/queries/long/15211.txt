Currently, we have some restrictions on the predicates that we can use in ON clauses for inner joins (we have those restrictions for outer joins too, but we will tackle that in a follow-up). Semantically equivalent queries can be expressed if the predicate is introduced in the WHERE clause, but we would like that user can express it both in ON and WHERE clause, as in standard SQL.
This patch is an extension to overcome these restrictions for inner joins.
It will allow to write queries that currently fail in Hive such as:



-- Disjunctions

SELECT *

FROM src1 JOIN src

ON (src1.key=src.key

  OR src1.value between 100 and 102

  OR src.value between 100 and 102)

LIMIT 10;

-- Conjunction with multiple inputs references in one side

SELECT *

FROM src1 JOIN src

ON (src1.key+src.key >= 100

  AND src1.key+src.key <= 102)

LIMIT 10;

-- Conjunct with no references

SELECT *

FROM src1 JOIN src

ON (src1.value between 100 and 102

  AND src.value between 100 and 102

  AND true)

LIMIT 10;
