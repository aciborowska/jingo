In the llap-daemon site you need to set, among other things,
llap.daemon.memory.per.instance.mb
and
hive.llap.io.cache.orc.size
The use of hive.llap.io.cache.orc.size caused me some unnecessary problems, initially I entered the value in MB rather than in bytes. Operator error you could say but I look at this as a fraction of the other value which is in mb.
Second, is this really tied to ORC? E.g. when we have the vectorized text reader will this data be cached as well? Or might it be in the future?
I would like to propose instead using hive.llap.io.cache.size.mb for this setting.
