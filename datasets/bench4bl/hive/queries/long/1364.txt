The value component of a SERDEPROPERTIES key/value pair is currently limited
to a maximum length of 767 characters. I believe that the motivation for limiting the length to 
767 characters is that this value is the maximum allowed length of an index in
a MySQL database running on the InnoDB engine: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=13315

The Metastore OR mapping currently limits many fields (including SERDEPROPERTIES.PARAM_VALUE) to a maximum length of 767 characters despite the fact that these fields are not indexed.
The maximum length of a VARCHAR value in MySQL 5.0.3 and later is 65,535.
We can expect many users to hit the 767 character limit on SERDEPROPERTIES.PARAM_VALUE when using the hbase.columns.mapping serdeproperty to map a table that has many columns.

I propose increasing the maximum allowed length of SERDEPROPERTIES.PARAM_VALUE to 8192.
