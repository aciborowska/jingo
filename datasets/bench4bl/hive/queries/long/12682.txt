I tested this on Hive 1.2.1 but looks like it's still applicable to 2.0.
I ran this query:



create table flights (

…

)

PARTITIONED BY (Year int)

CLUSTERED BY (Month)

SORTED BY (DayofMonth) into 12 buckets

STORED AS ORC

TBLPROPERTIES("orc.bloom.filter.columns"="*")

;

I profiled just the reduce phase and noticed something odd, the attached graph shows where time was spent during the reducer phase.

Problem seems to relate to https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/branch-2.0/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/FileSinkOperator.java#L903
