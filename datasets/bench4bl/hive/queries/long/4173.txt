Hive is ignoring Filter conditions given at Multi Insert select statement when  Filtering given on Source Query..
To highlight this issue, please see below example with where clause (status!='C') from employee12 table causing issue and due to which insert filters (batch_id='12 and batch_id!='12' )not working and dumping all the data coming from source to both the tables.
I have checked the hive execution plan, and didn't find Filter predicates under for filtering record per insert statements
from 
(from employee12
select * 
where status!='C') t
insert into table employee1
select 
status,
field1,
'T' as field2,
'P' as field3,
'C' as field4
where batch_id='12'
insert into table employee2
select
status,
field1,
'D' as field2, 
'P' as field3,
'C' as field4
where batch_id!='12';
It is working fine with single insert. Hive generating plan properly.. 
I am able to reproduce this issue with 8.1 and 9.0 version of Hive.
