Right now, LLAP logs counters for every fragment; most of them are IO related and could be very useful, they also include table names so that things like cache hit ratio, etc., could be calculated for every table.
We need to output them to some metrics system (preserving the breakdown by table, possibly also adding query ID or even stage) so that they'd be usable without grep/sed/awk.
