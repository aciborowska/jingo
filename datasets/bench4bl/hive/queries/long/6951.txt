Hive 0.13 changed the signature of HiveOutputFormat (through commit r1527149) breaking backwards compatibility with previous releases; the return type of getHiveRecordWriter has been changed from RecordWriter to FSRecordWriter.
FSRecordWriter introduces one new method on top of RecordWriter however it does not extend the previous interface and it lives in a completely new package.
Thus code running fine on Hive 0.12 breaks on Hive 0.13. After the upgrade, code running on HIve 0.13, will break on anything lower than this.
This could have easily been avoided by extending the existing interface or introducing a new one that RecordWriter could have extended going forward. By changing the signature, the existing contract (and compatibility) has been voided.
