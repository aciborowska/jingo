The following query returns incorrect result when constant optimization is turned on. The subquery happens to have an alias p1 to be the same as the input partition name. Constant optimizer will optimize it incorrectly as the constant.
When constant optimizer is turned off, we will get the correct result.

set hive.cbo.enable=false;

set hive.optimize.constant.propagation = true;

create table t1(c1 string, c2 double) partitioned by (p1 string, p2 string);

create table t2(p1 double, c2 string);

insert into table t1 partition(p1='40', p2='p2') values('c1', 0.0);

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE t2  select if((c2 = 0.0), c2, '0') as p1, 2 as p2 from t1 where c1 = 'c1' and p1 = '40';

select * from t2;



40   2
