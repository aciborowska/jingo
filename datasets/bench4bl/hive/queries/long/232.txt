the hive.metastore.warehouse.dir configuration property in hive-*.xml needs to use the protocol, host, and port when it is inherited from the fs.name property in hadoop-site.xml.
When it doesn't and no protocol is found then a broad range of "Move" operations when the source and target are both in the DFS will fail.
Currently this can be worked around by prepending the protocol, host and port of the hadoop nameserver into the value of the hive.metastore.warehouse.dir property.
