HIVE-12473 has added an incorrect comment and also lacks a test case.
Benefits of this fix:

Does not say: "Probably doesn't work"
Does not use grammar like "subquery columns and such"
Adds test cases, that let you verify the fix
Doesn't rely on certain structure of key expr, just takes the type at compile time
Doesn't require an additional walk of each key expression
Shows the type used in explain
