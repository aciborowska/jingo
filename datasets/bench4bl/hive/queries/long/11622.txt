In the following CREATE TABLE the following map-typed column leads to the wrong type. I suspect some problem with inferring the Avro schema from the column definitions, but I am not sure.
Reproduction:



hive> create table t (c map<string,array<int>>) stored as avro;

OK

Time taken: 0.101 seconds

hive> desc t;

OK

c                   	array<map<string,int>>	from deserializer   

Time taken: 0.135 seconds, Fetched: 1 row(s)



Note how the type shown in DESCRIBE is not the type originally passed in the CREATE TABLE.
However, sometimes the DESCRIBE shows the correct output. You may also try these steps which produce a similar problem to increase the chance of hitting this issue:



hive> create table t (c array<map<string,int>>) stored as avro;

OK

Time taken: 0.063 seconds

hive> desc t;

OK

c                   	map<string,array<int>>	from deserializer   

Time taken: 0.152 seconds, Fetched: 1 row(s)
