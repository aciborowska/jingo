Yes, I am guilty as charged, I don't use mac like the rest of you 
The Hive CLI currently doesn't work with cygwin under windows, this is due to the dual path model that cygwin employs (there are file paths relative to the cygwin virtual root, and file paths relative to the windows root)
Since Sun's JDK is installed under the windows environment, if the paths are not converted to windows format before being passed along then java will be at a loss to where the files are. The solution is to use the cygpath command to convert the paths to windows format before passing along to java world.
I have a fix for this already, still doing some further testing (to make sure it works under both unix and windows environments), then I will submit patch to this bug (should submit before end of this week).
