CREATE TABLE t (t STRING);
SELECT t FROM t;
This will result in 
FAILED: Error in semantic analysis: Line 1:7 Ambiguous table alias or column reference 't'
Similarly
SELECT t2 FROM t t2;
will result in the same exception
SELECT t from t t2;
will succeed.
MySQL apparently supports this, so Hive should as well.
