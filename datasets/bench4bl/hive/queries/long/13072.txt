When using ROW_NUMBER() on tables with more than 25000 rows, the function ROW_NUMBER() duplicates rows with separate row numbers.
Reproduce by using a large table with more than 25000 rows with distinct values and then using a query involving ROW_NUMBER(). It will then result in getting the same distinct values twice with separate row numbers apart by 25000.
