When HS2 is used as a gateway for the LDAP users to access and run the queries in kerberized cluster, it's authentication mode is configured as LDAP and at this time, HoS might fail by the same reason as HIVE-10594. 
hive.server2.authentication is not a proper property to determine if a cluster is kerberized, instead hadoop.security.authentication should be used.
The failure is in spark client communicating with rest of hadoop as it assumes kerberos does not need to be used.
