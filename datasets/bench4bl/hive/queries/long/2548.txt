I am walking through the developer's guide and tutorial and finding issues: e.g. broken links.   Is there a way to try out updates to the docs and submit patches?
Here is the first example on https://cwiki.apache.org/Hive/tutorial.html
The following examples highlight some salient features of the system. A detailed set of "query test cases" can be found at Hive Query Test Cases and the corresponding results can be found at "Query Test Case Results".
The first link is listed as http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/hive/trunk/ql/src/test/queries/clientpositive/
Second link is http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/hive/trunk/ql/src/test/results/clientpositive/
Both links are 404's
