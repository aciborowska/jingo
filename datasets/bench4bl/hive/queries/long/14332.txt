Lines like this repeat all over the log. This gets really big with a large number of partitions. 6MB of logs per node for a 30 task query running for 20 seconds on a 3 node cluster.
Instead of logging this line - can we have a consolidated log / logging only if something abnormal happens ... or a shorter log message.
