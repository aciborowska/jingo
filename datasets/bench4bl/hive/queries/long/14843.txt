As reported by Eugene Koifman and tested by myself, your patch introduced ambiguity into the grammar.



warning(200): IdentifiersParser.g:327:5:

Decision can match input such as "KW_DAY KW_TO KW_SECOND" using multiple alternatives: 2, 5



As a result, alternative(s) 5 were disabled for that input

warning(200): IdentifiersParser.g:327:5:

Decision can match input such as "KW_YEAR KW_TO KW_MONTH" using multiple alternatives: 1, 3



As a result, alternative(s) 3 were disabled for that input



Could you please take another look? Thanks.
