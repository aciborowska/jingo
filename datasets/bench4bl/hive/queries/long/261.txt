we have this query:
SELECT a.u, b.id FROM (
 SELECT a1.u, a1.id as id FROM t_1 a1 WHERE a1.date = '2009-01-01' UNION ALL
 SELECT a2.u, a2.id as id FROM t_2 a2 WHERE a2.date = '2009-01-01' UNION ALL
 ...
 SELECT aN.u, aN.id as id FROM t_N an WHERE aN.date = '2009-01-01'
) a 
JOIN t b ON a.id = b.id WHERE b.date='2009-01-01' 
GROUP BY a.u, b.id
When we union more than 20 tables, the query will hang. It looks like something wrong in the compiler.
