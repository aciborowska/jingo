Enabling "hive.vectorized.execution.mapjoin.native.fast.hashtable.enabled" causes incorrect results when running with LLAP.
I believe this does not happen for simple container runs. However, it's possible that caching of these tables, or using the same table more than once causes issues - which may be seen with container reuse.
The results vary by a small percentage.
e.g. 82270, 82267 <- Two results for the same query run back to back.
