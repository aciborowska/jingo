We've had feedback from Ambari folks on Schematool usage being opaque on errors.
While, yes, the underlying error is present hidden in the stacktrace if you do a --verbose, that is often unwieldy and unusable. And without a --verbose, there is no indication of what actually went wrong.
Thus, we need to fix this.
