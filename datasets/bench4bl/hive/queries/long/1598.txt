Hive query's result is written to a temporary directory first and then FetchTask takes the files and display it to the users. Currently the file format used for the resulting file is TextFile format. This could cause incorrect result display if some string typed column contains new lines, which are used as record delimiters in TextInputFormat. Switching to SequenceFile format will solve this problem.
