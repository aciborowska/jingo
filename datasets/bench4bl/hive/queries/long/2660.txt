The exception handling in nextKeyValueTolerateCorruptions treats IOException as follows:

if EOFException, corrupt, can be tolerated
If CheckSumException, corrupt, can be tolerated
else not a corruption, re-throw

But the compression code can also throw IOException in case of corruption, which will get re-thrown in this case.
The correct way of handling IOException is:

if BlockMissingException, re-throw.
if not BlockMissingException -> corruption, can be tolerated
