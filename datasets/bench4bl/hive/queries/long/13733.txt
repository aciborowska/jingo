hive> create table t (i int,a string,b string);
hive> insert into t values (1,'hello','world'),(2,'bye',null);
hive> select * from t where t.b is null;
2	bye	NULL
This is wrong, all 3 columns should return the same value - t.a.
hive> with cte as (select t.a as a,t.a as b,t.a as c from t where t.b is null) select * from cte;
bye	NULL	bye
However, these are right:
hive> select t.a as a,t.a as b,t.a as c from t where t.b is null;
bye	bye	bye
hive> with cte as (select t.a as a,t.a as b,t.a as c from t where t.b is not null) select * from cte;OK
hello	hello	hello
