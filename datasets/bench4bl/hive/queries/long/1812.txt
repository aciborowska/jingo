Running a test such as load_dyn_part1.q, there is a lot of noise like this:
test:
[junit] Copying data from file:/Users/jsichi/open/hive-trunk/data/files/kv1.txt
[junit] Loading data to table srcpart partition (ds=2008-04-08, hr=11)
[junit] rmr: cannot remove pfile:/Users/jsichi/open/hive-trunk/build/ql/test/data/warehouse/srcpart/ds=2008-04-08/hr=11: No such file or directory.
This shows up in production logs as well, which confuses users, making them thinking that the job is encountering problems when it isn't.  Is there a way we can squelch these?
