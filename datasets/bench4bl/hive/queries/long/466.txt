There was a bug in the SemanticAnalyzer that adds the columnID for one more time for "*".
This causes queries like this to fail:



create table zshao_lazy (a int);

// load one row of data into zshao_lazy

select * from (select *, a as a2 from zshao_lazy) z order by a2 limit 10;



The query will fail at execution time.
