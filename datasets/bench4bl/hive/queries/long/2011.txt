ERROR 1071 (42000) at line 16: Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes



Here's the cause of the problem from upgrade-0.6.0.mysql.sql:



...

ALTER TABLE `COLUMNS` MODIFY `TYPE_NAME` VARCHAR(4000);

...

ALTER TABLE `COLUMNS` DROP PRIMARY KEY;

ALTER TABLE `COLUMNS` ADD PRIMARY KEY (`SD_ID`, `COLUMN_NAME`);

...



We need to make sure that the PK on COLUMNS.TYPE_NAME is dropped before the size of the column is bumped to 4000.
