https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3682 is great but non local directory don't seem to be supported:



insert overwrite directory '/tmp/test-02'

row format delimited

FIELDS TERMINATED BY ':'

select description FROM sample_07






Error while compiling statement: FAILED: ParseException line 2:0 cannot recognize input near 'row' 'format' 'delimited' in select clause



This works (with 'local'):



insert overwrite local directory '/tmp/test-02'

row format delimited

FIELDS TERMINATED BY ':'

select code, description FROM sample_07
