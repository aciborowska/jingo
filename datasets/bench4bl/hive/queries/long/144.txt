Since HIVE-98, the build process copies the contents of the ql/src/java directory to build/gen-java where the code generated from Hive.g is located. This makes it a bit more difficult to work on the project in Eclipse, since one has to add the build/gen-java folder to the project and not ql/src/java. This means we'll edit the ql java files in the wrong location. Adding both of these directories will of course result in duplicate entries.
