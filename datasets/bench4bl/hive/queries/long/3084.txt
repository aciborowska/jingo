Hive's CI job regularly fails due to this test:



org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestNegativeCliDriver.testNegativeCliDriver_script_broken_pipe1



Running just that test in a loop I'm not able to reproduce the issue locally. This may be related to state from a previous test causing this one to fail?



ant clean package

for x in $(seq 1 10); 

  do ant test -Dtestcase=TestNegativeCliDriver -Dqfile=script_broken_pipe1.q;

done
