This bug manifested to me, when first thing I did after starting Hive, was to call use <db_name>; but then calling show tables; was still showing tables from the default database (and I had to call "use" again to actually change database). This bug might have manifested only due to a specific Hive deployment I am using (I didn't investigate this issue that deeply).
