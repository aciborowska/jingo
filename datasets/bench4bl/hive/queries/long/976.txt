Currently, all lines starting with file: are ignored.
It means that
file:/Users/heyongqiang/Documents/workspace/Hive-Test/build/ql/test/data/warehouse/srcbucket/srcbucket0.txt [s]
and
file:/Users/heyongqiang/Documents/workspace/Hive-Test/build/ql/test/data/warehouse/srcbucket [s]
are same - that is not good because it will hide some of the optimizations of sampling.
This should be changed to compare the last token.
