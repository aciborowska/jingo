Multiple other apache components allow sending metrics over to Hadoop2 metrics, which allow for monitoring solutions like Ambari Metrics Server to work against that to show metrics for components in one place. Our Codahale metrics works very well, so ideally, we would like to bridge the two, to allow Codahale to add a Hadoop2 reporter that enables us to continue to use Codahale metrics (i.e. not write another custom metrics impl) but report using Hadoop2.
Apache Phoenix also had such a recent usecase and were in the process of adding in a stub piece that allows this forwarding. We should use the same reporter to minimize redundancy while pushing metrics to a centralized solution like Hadoop2 Metrics/AMS.
