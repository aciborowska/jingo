in many cases, we cannot help producing a large number of output files in a final result table. This can put pressure on the namenode and as well makes downstream queries potentially inefficient (until we have combinefileinputformat). Users would like to have a simple utility in hive to reduce the number of files by concatenating them together. This should apply on a per partition basis.
Long term - Hive should do this kind of compaction automatically - either online or offline.
