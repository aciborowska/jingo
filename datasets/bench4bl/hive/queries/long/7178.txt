The following SQL doesn't work: 



EXPLAIN 

SELECT alias.a, alias.b, alias.c, COUNT(DISTINCT d) 

FROM table_name alias 

GROUP BY alias.a, alias.b, alias.c 

GROUPING SETS( (alias.a), (alias.b, alias.a) ); 

FAILED: ParseException line 15:34 missing ) at ',' near '<EOF>' 

line 16:0 extraneous input ')' expecting EOF near '<EOF>' 



The following SQL works (without alias in grouping set): 



EXPLAIN 

SELECT a, b, c, COUNT(DISTINCT d) 

FROM table_name 

GROUP BY a, b, c 

GROUPING SETS( (a), (b, a) ); 



Alias works for just one column: 



EXPLAIN 

SELECT alias.a, alias.b, alias.c, COUNT(DISTINCT d) 

FROM table_name alias 

GROUP BY alias.a, alias.b, alias.c 

GROUPING SETS( (alias.a) ); 



Using alias in GROUPING SETS could be very useful if multiple tables are involved in the SELECT (via JOIN)
