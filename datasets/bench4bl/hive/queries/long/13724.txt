HIVE-12832 changed branch-1 hive pom file and updated thrift version from 0.9.2 to 0.9.3. But it didn't update the thrift args part to use undated annotation from HIVE-11591.
So every time someone is running maven thrift re-gen command, it will still update a lot of unrelated files, just because of the date change.
Need backport HIVE-11591 to branch-1.
