In PTest2 if there is an exception during a run, we don't replace the bad hosts. Specifically this code in PTest.run should be in a finally block:

        for(HostExecutor hostExecutor : mHostExecutors) {

          if(hostExecutor.remainingDrones() == 0) {

            mExecutionContext.addBadHost(hostExecutor.getHost());

          }

        }
