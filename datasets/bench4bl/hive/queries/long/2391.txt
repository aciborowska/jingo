The Hive artifacts published in Apache Maven SNAPSHOTS repo are incorrect. 
Dependencies are not complete.
Even after adding as dependencies ALL the Hive artifacts it is not possible to compile a project using Hive JARs (I'm trying to integrate Oozie Hive Action using Apache Hive).
As a reference the Hive CDH POMs dependencies could be used (Using those artifacts I'm able to compile/test/run Hive from within Oozie).
