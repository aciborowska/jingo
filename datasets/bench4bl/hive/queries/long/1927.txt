The patch for HIVE-1696 is the source a test failure on Hudson. The likely cause of
this failure is that the classpath is not being set correctly for the TestHadoop20SAuthBridge
test, which depends on the security enhanced version of Hadoop.
A couple things to note:

Hive tests are supposed to run against Hadoop 0.20.0 by default. This value is set in the build.properties file in the project top-level. Altering the Hudson job to set hadoop.version to some other value is not a fix for this issue since the Hudson job will then cease to reflect the default behavior of Hive tests.
HIVE-1696 added new secure compile targets to the shims/build.xml file. These targets explicitly set the classpath to include the secure version of Hadoop. The fix for this issue likely involves overriding the "test" target in shims/build.xml and explicitly setting the classpath in this target to also use the secure version of Hadoop.
