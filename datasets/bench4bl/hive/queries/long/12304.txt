Currently "drop database cascade" command doesn't unregister the functions under the database. If the functions are not unregistered, in some cases like "describe db1.func1" will still show the info for the function; or if the same database is recreated, "drop if exists db1.func1" will throw an exception since the function is considered existing from the registry while it doesn't exist in metastore.
