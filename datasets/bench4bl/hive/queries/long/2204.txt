I have a table age_group and I am trying to get list of columns for this table name. As underscore and '%' have special meaning in table search pattern according to JDBC searchPattern string specification, I escape the '_' in my table name when I call getColumns for this single table. But HIVE does not return any columns. My call to getColumns is as follows
catalog	<null>
schemaPattern	"%"
tableNamePattern  "age_group"
columnNamePattern  "%"
If I don't escape the '_' in my tableNamePattern, I am able to get the list of columns.
