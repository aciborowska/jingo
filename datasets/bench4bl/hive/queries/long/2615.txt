Create the table with a column that always contains NULL:

hive> create table bad as select 1 x, null z from dual;     
Because there's no type, Hive gives it the VOID type:

hive> describe bad;
OK
x	int	
z	void	
This seems weird, because AFAIK, there is no normal way to create a column of type VOID.  The problem is that the table can't be queried:

hive> select * from bad;
OK
Failed with exception java.io.IOException:java.lang.RuntimeException: Internal error: no LazyObject for VOID
Worse, even if you don't select that field, the query fails at runtime:

hive> select x from bad;
...
FAILED: Execution Error, return code 2 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.MapRedTask
