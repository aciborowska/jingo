I've noticed some odd behaviour...while fabricating a test:
in ExplainTask#getJSONLogicalPlan there is a call to #outputMap which exchanges the outputJson and the extended boolean values.
for extended json explain question there is no difference; but for non-extended json queries there is no output at all.
i'm separating this small change because it might need qtest updates
