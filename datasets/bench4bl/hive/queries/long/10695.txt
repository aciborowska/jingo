Following query produces wrong result:
select * from t1 s left outer join  (select key, value from t1) f on s.key=f.key and s.value=f.value   left outer join  (select key, value from t1) c on s.key=c.key where f.key is null;
This is due to PPD getting confused between qualified col name & non qualified.
In many places in code column info doesn't include table alias which leads to PPD problem.
This is fixed in trunk as part of HIVE-9327 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9327
