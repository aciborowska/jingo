Hadoop 0.20 depends on servlet-api-2.5-6.1.14.jar and jetty-6.1.14.jar/jetty-util-6.1.11.jar instead of servlet-api.jar and jetty-5.1.4.jar.
The eclipse-files ant target needs to be updated to take this account (which involves editing eclipse-templates/.classpath)
and adding some conditional logic to build.xml
Here's what you see currently after importing into eclipse:
Project 'apache-hive' is missing required library: 'build/hadoopcore/hadoop-0.20.0/lib/jetty-5.1.4.jar'
Project 'apache-hive' is missing required library: 'build/hadoopcore/hadoop-0.20.0/lib/servlet-api.jar'
