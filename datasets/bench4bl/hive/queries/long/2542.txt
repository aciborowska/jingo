The hive meta store client does not delete the non-native tables during the drop database <dbname> cascade operation. As a result even though the database is deleted the tables still exist. This is related to HCATALOG-144. 
A deeper look at the HiveMetaStoreClient's "dropDatabase" function, tells us that the function does not utilize the hive meta hooks of the tables in the database for dropping the non-native tables.
