The OrcListObjectInspector and OrcMapObjectInspector classes do not check for null data and instead throw an exception. To comply with the JavaDocs for ListObjectInspector and MapObjectInspector, these classes should be updated to check for null data.
The following checks should be added for OrcListObjectInspector:

getListElement(Object, int) should return null for null list, out-of-the-range index
getListLength(Object) should return -1 for data = null
getList(Object) should return null for data = null

The following checks should be added for OrcMapObjectInspector:

getMap(Object) should return null for data = null
getMapSize(Object) return -1 for NULL map
