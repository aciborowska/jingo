Two bugs:
1. if UDAF uses string type, Group-by will break as it tries to insert an ArrayList<Object> to a HashMap<KeyWrapper, AggregationBuffer[]>.
2. The code to sample size of keys only handles String type and Text type, while in most cases, they are org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazyString, so that 0 is always used.
