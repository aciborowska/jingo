For the new hive cluster , when multiple hive client is getting the connection for hive server , there are 3 problems in metastore , hive client.
1. Since the derby is booted at first connection,  multiple client try to create database.One of the client succeed and another one throw exception because of unique primary constraint in metatables.
2. Once the Runtime exception is throw, the hive client which is made connection request will hang forever.
3. Potentially "ConcurrentModificationException" is thrown by JDOQuery.
