Running hive server for long time > 90 minutes results in too many open file-handles, eventually causing the server to crash as the server runs out of file handle.
Actual bug as described by Carl Steinbach:
the hive_job_log_* files are created by the HiveHistory class. This class creates a PrintWriter for writing to the file, but never closes the writer. It looks like we need to add a cleanup method to HiveHistory that closes the PrintWriter and does any other necessary cleanup.
