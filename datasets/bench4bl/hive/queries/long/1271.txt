Type information specified  while using a custom reduce script is converted to lower case, and causes type mismatch during query semantic analysis .  The following REDUCE query where field name =  "userId" failed.
hive> CREATE TABLE SS (
   >                     a INT,
   >                     b INT,
   >                     vals ARRAY<STRUCT<userId:INT, y:STRING>>
   >                 );
OK
hive> FROM (select * from srcTable DISTRIBUTE BY id SORT BY id) s
   >     INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE SS
   >     REDUCE *
   >         USING 'myreduce.py'
   >         AS
   >                     (a INT,
   >                     b INT,
   >                     vals ARRAY<STRUCT<userId:INT, y:STRING>>
   >                     )
   >         ;
FAILED: Error in semantic analysis: line 2:27 Cannot insert into
target table because column number/types are different SS: Cannot
convert column 2 from array<struct<userId:int,y:string>> to
array<struct<userid:int,y:string>>.
The same query worked fine after changing "userId" to "userid".
