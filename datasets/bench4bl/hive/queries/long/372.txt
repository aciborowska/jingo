When nesting UDFs, the Hive Query processor takes a large amount of time+memory to process the query. For example, I ran something along the lines of:
select trim( trim( trim(trim( trim( trim( trim( trim( trim(column))))))))) from test_table;
This query needs 10GB+ of memory to process before it'll launch the job. The amount of memory increases exponentially with each nested UDF.
Obviously, I am using trim() in this case as a simple example that causes the same problem to occur. In my actual use-case I had a bunch of nested regexp_replaces.
