Thanks to Jesus Camacho Rodriguez for uncovering this issue as part of HIVE-13269. StatsSetupConst.areColumnStatsUptoDate() is used to check whether stats are up-to-date.  In case of PerfCliDriver, ‘false’ (thus, not up-to-date) is returned and the following debug message in the logs:



In StatsSetupConst, JsonParser can not parse COLUMN_STATS. (line 190 in StatsSetupConst)



Looks like the issue started happening after HIVE-12261 went in. 
The fix would be to replace
COLUMN_STATS_ACCURATE,true
with
COLUMN_STATS_ACCURATE,{"COLUMN_STATS":{"key":"true","value":"true"},"BASIC_STATS":"true"}
where key, value are the column names.
