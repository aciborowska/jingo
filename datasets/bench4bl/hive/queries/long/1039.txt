As wd pointed out in hive-user, the following query only load data to the first local directory. Multi-insert to tables works fine. 
hive> from test
    > INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/stefdong/tmp/0' select *
where a = 1
    > INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/stefdong/tmp/1' select *
where a = 3;
