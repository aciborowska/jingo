_tmp files are getting left behind on insert overwrite directory:
/user/jssarma/ctst1/40422_m_000195_0.deflate  <r 3> 13285 2008-12-07 01:47  rw-r-r- jssarma supergroup
/user/jssarma/ctst1/40422_m_000196_0.deflate  <r 3> 3055  2008-12-07 01:46  rw-r-r- jssarma supergroup
/user/jssarma/ctst1/_tmp.40422_m_000033_0 <r 3> 0 2008-12-07 01:53  rw-r-r- jssarma supergroup

this happened with speculative execution. the code looks good (in fact in this case many speculative tasks were launched - and only a couple caused problems). Almost seems like these files did not appear in the namespace until after the map-reduce job finished and the movetask did a listing of the output dir ..
