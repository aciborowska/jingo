The merge job set mapred.min.split.size to the value of hive.merge.size.per.task, which roughly equals to the output file size. However the input split size is also determined by mapred.min.split.size.per.node, mapred.min.split.size.per.rack, and mapred.max.split.size. They should be set the same as hive.merge.size.per.task as well.
