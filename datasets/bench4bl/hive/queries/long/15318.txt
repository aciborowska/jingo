The current implementation of "insert into db1.table1 values()" creates a tmp table under the current database while table1 may not be under current database. 
e.g.,

use default;

create database db1;

create table db1.table1(x int);

insert into db1.table1 values(3);



It will create the tmp table under default database. Now if authorization is turned on and the current user only has access to db1 but not default database, then it will cause access issue.
We may need to rethink the approach for the implementation.
