As part of the changes to HIVE-5260, it appears that HBase properties set in hive-conf.xml are being clobbered by defaults from hbase-default.xml.
Specifically, we noticed it when attempting to set hbase.zookeeper.quorum. That value defaults to 'localhost' and results in queries of HBase tables hanging attempting to acquire a lock from a Zookeeper instance which isn't running.
Any properties set in hive-site.xml will be overwritten by those in hbase-default.xml, which doesn't seem good.
The call to HBaseConfiguration.addHbaseResources(jobConf) seems to be the culprit, around line 337.
