 Tighten up EOF bounds checking in LazyBinaryDeserializeRead so bytes beyond stated row end are never read.  Use WritableUtils.decodeVIntSize to check for room ahead like regular LazyBinary code does.
Display more detailed information when an exception is thrown by DeserializeRead classes.
Add Unit Tests, including some designed that catch the errors like HIVE-13818.
