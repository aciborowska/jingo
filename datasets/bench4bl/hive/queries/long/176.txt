When launching off hive queries using hive -e is there a way to get the job id so that I can just queue them up and go check their statuses later? What's the general pattern for queueing and monitoring without using the libraries directly?
I'm gonna throw my vote in for a structured log format. Users could tail it and use whatever queuing or monitoring they wish. It's also probably just a 30 minute project for someone already familiar with the code. I suggest ^A seperated key=value pairs per log line.
