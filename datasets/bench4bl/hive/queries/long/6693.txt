CREATE TABLE testCase (n BIGINT)
select case when (n >3) then n else 0 end from testCase
fail with error : 
[Error 10016]: Line 1:36 Argument type mismatch '0': The expression after ELSE should have the same type as those after THEN: "bigint" is expected but "int" is found'.
bigint and int should be more compatible, at least int should implictly cast to bigint.
