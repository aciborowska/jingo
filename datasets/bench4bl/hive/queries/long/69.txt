In SemanticAnalyzer, genmapredtasks() does not use a tree walker. For map-side joins, the taskplan needs to be enhanced to be possibly
broken at MapSink also. Basically, the code is very difficult to enhance since there are implicit assumptions that reduce sink is the only
operator where the plan breaks.
This should be enhanced so that the user can implement their own task generation logic which is independent of the tree walking.
