if the location is not an external location - this would be safer.
the problem right now is that it's tricky to use the drop and rename way of writing new data into a table. consider:
Initialization block:
drop table a_tmp
create table a_tmp like a;
Loading block:
load data <newdata> into a_tmp;
drop table a;
alter table a_tmp rename to a;
this looks safe. but it's not. if one runs this multiple times - then data is lost (since 'a' is pointing to 'a_tmp''s location after any iteration. and dropping table 'a' blows away loaded data in the next iteration). 
if the location is being managed by Hive - then 'rename' should switch location as well.
