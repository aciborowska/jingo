Hi ,
I am trying to download Hive as specified in the apache site and getting the following error.
[hadoop@system9 ~]$ svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/hive/trunk
svn: PROPFIND request failed on '/repos/asf/hadoop/hive/trunk'
svn: PROPFIND of '/repos/asf/hadoop/hive/trunk': Could not resolve hostname `svn.apache.org': Temporary failure in name resolution (http://svn.apache.org)
but am able to ping that ipaddress from web browser.
Please help me to resolve this issue.
Or else please suggest me any other way to download hive.
Thanks in advance..
