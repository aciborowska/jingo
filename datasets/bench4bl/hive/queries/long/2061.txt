We have seen a use case where in the user's script, it run 'add jar hive_contrib.jar'. Since Hive has moved the jar file to be hive-contrib-
{version}
.jar, it introduced backward incompatibility. If we as the user to change the script and when Hive upgrade version again, the user need to change the script again. Creating a symlink seems to be the best solution.
