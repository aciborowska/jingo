In many DW and BI systems, the data are stored in RDBMS for now such as oracle, mysql, postgresql ... for reporting, charting and etc.
It would be useful to be able to import data from RDBMS and export data to RDBMS using JDBC connections.
If Hive support JDBC connections, It wll be much easier to use 3rd party DW/BI tools.
