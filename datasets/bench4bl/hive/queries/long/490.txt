this is profoundly irritating. we can estimate reducers. but since hadoop-default.xml sets this to '1' - by default we don't. if we expect most users to set this to -1 - then we might as well set it to -1 ourselves.
to not shoot ourselves in the foot - we might want to cap number of reducers based on cluster size (like 2*Nodes).
