A query like:
select ... from A join B..  limit 10;
where the limit is performed on the reducer can be further optimized.
Currently, all the operators on the reduce side will be done, but the ExecReducer will un-necessarily deserialize all the rows.
The following optimizations can be done:
1. Do nothing in reduce() in ExecReducer.
2. Modify map-reduce framework so that it does not even invoke the reduce() method in ExecReducer.
2. may require some work from hadoop - but we should minimally do 1.
