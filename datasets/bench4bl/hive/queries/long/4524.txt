Currently, HCatalog has its own HCatHBaseStorageHandler that extends from HBaseStorageHandler to allow for StorageHandler support, and does some translations, like org.apache.mapred->org.apache.mapreduce wrapping, etc. However, this compatibility layer is not complete in functionality as it still assumes the underlying OutputFormat is a mapred.OutputFormat implementation as opposed to a HiveOutputFormat implementation, and it makes assumptions about config property copies that implementations of the HiveStorageHandler, such as the HBaseStorageHandler do not do.
To fix this, we need to improve the ability for HCat to properly load native-hive-style StorageHandlers.
Also, since HCat has its own HBaseStorageHandler and we'd like to not maintain two separate HBaseStorageHandlers, the idea is to deprecate HCat's storage handler over time, and make sure that hive's HBaseStorageHandler works properly from HCat, and over time, have it reach feature parity with the HCat one.
