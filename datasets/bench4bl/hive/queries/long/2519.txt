Suppose the table schema is (a string, b string) partitioned by (p1 string, p2 string), a dynamic partition insert is allowed to:
insert overwrite ... partition (p2="...", p1);
which will create the wrong HDFS directory structure such as /.../p2=.../p1=.... This is contradictory to the metastore's assumption of the HDFS directory structure.
