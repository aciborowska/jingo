There are quite some new optimizations in Spark 2.0.0. We need to bump up Spark to 2.0.0 to benefit those performance improvements.
To update Spark version to 2.0.0, the following changes are required:

Spark API updates:
	
SparkShuffler#call return Iterator instead of Iterable
SparkListener -> JavaSparkListener
InputMetrics constructor doesnâ€™t accept readMethod
Method remoteBlocksFetched and localBlocksFetched in ShuffleReadMetrics return long type instead of integer




Dependency upgrade:
	
Jackson: 2.4.2 -> 2.6.5
Netty version: 4.0.23.Final -> 4.0.29.Final
Scala binary version: 2.10 -> 2.11
Scala version: 2.10.4 -> 2.11.8
