Looking at the Driver#runInternal(String command, boolean alreadyCompiled):



    HiveDriverRunHookContext hookContext = new HiveDriverRunHookContextImpl(conf, command);

    // Get all the driver run hooks and pre-execute them.

    List<HiveDriverRunHook> driverRunHooks;



The context is initialized with the command passed in to the method. However, this command is always null if alreadyCompiled is true, which is the case for HS2 mode.
