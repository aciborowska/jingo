some problem in multi-table insert if both of them contain grouping keys which are different.
have not marked it a blocker, since a workaround exists (issue both inserts separately) - but this if the release is not yet done, we should fix this also.
FROM SRC
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE DEST1 SELECT SRC.key, src.value, COUNT(DISTINCT SUBSTR(SRC.value,5)) GROUP BY SRC.key\
, src.value
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE DEST2 SELECT SRC.key, COUNT(DISTINCT SUBSTR(SRC.value,5)) GROUP BY SRC.key;
