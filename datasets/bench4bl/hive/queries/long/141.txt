for example, I have a table, which has two partitions:
tmp_table_name/dt=2008-11-01
tmp_table_name/dt=2008-11-02
When we use hive metastore to drop the first partition (as root), I expect the data file will be moved to user/root/.Trash/081103xxxx/tmp_table_name/dt=2008-11-01 by default. However, directory tmp_table_name was not created, the data was moved to user/root/.Trash/081103xxxx/dt=2008-11-01, which makes data recovery a very difficult task.
