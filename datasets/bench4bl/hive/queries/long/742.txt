BTW, I tried joins and it doesn't handle NULL semantics correctly. Here's the data and results:
Table:
Key Value
------- -------
NULL 325
18 NULL
Query:
select * from input4_cb a join input4_cb b on a.key = b.value;
Result:
NULL 325 18 NULL
The correct result should be empty set.
I guess the NULL vs. NULL comparison is incorrectly evaluated.
