Ideally, there should be one common entity instead of readentity/writeentity.
Unfortunately, that would be a backward incompatible change since users os hive might have written
there own hooks, where they are using readentity/writeentity.
We should atleast create a common class, and then we can deprecate read/write entity later, for a new release.
For now, I propose to make a backward compatible change.
