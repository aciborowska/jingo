BlockMergeTask has a main() and when used directly (instead of say partition concatenate feature), the -jobconf arguments are not honored. This is not something most people directly use.
Usage:
BlockMergeTask -input <colon seperated input paths>  -outputDir outputDir [-jobconf k1=v1 [-jobconf k2=v2] ...] 
To reproduce:
Run BlockMergeTask with say -jobconf mapred.job.name=test and launched job will have a different name.
