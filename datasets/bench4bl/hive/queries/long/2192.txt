HIVE-2185 introduced a new column in the intermediate stats table. This introduces incompatibility between old and new branches (multiple branches could be deployed in production): the old branch will not work with the new schema, and the new branch will not work with the old schema. A solution would be to rename the stats table name (requires code change) or use a different database name (requires hive-default.xml conf change).
