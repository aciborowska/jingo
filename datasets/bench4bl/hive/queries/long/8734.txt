Renaming tables does not alter the data stored in the TAB_COL_STATS. So if a user renames table1 to table2 they will also need to re-compute statistics against this table.
This is an inconvenience and puts the metastore in an inconsistent state. It neither drops or updates TAB_COL_STATS.TABLE_NAME. So you will have an entry for both the old table name and the new table name.
This lingering data is also inherited by any table that assumes the previously used table name.
