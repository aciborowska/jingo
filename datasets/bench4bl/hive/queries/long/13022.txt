When i'm printing my out put with the header, each field name is coming with _u1. , i need fix this one as soon as possible my project is on production stage it need to upload to the web, it will make lot of conflicts.
for example my field names are looks like this 
field1 field2 field3 field4
but in out put it's printing like this 
_u1.field1 _u1.field2 _u1.field3 _u1.field4
my script looks like this 
select * from(
)
union all
select * from (
);
i'm running this script with using TEZ.
