Quoting Gopal V:

So, something like a sum() GROUP BY will create a few hundred thousand

AbstractAggregationBuffer objects all of which will suddenly go out of

scope when the map.aggr flushes it down to the sort buffer.



That particular GC collection takes forever because the tiny buffers take

a lot of time to walk over and then they leave the memory space

fragmented, which requires a compaction pass (which btw, writes to a

page-interleaved NUMA zone).



And to make things worse, the pre-allocated sort buffers with absolutely

zero data in them take up most of the tenured regions causing these chunks

of memory to be visited more and more often as they are part of the Eden

space.



We need flat data structures to be GC friendly.
