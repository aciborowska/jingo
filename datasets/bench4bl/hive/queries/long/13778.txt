I've noticed that when we do a DROP TABLE tablename PURGE on a table on S3A that has many files, the files never get deleted. However, the Hive metastore logs do say that the path was deleted:
"Not moving [path] to trash"
"Deleted the diretory [path]"
I initially thought that this was due to the eventually consistent nature of S3 for deletes, however, a week later, the files still exist.
