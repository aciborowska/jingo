We need to delete the .ant directory containing the old ivy version in order to fix it 
(and if we're using the same environment for both trunk and branches, either 
segregate them or script an rm to clean in between).
It's worth noting that ant may have picked up the old version of Ivy from
somewhere else. In order Ant's classpath contains:

Ant's startup JAR file, ant-launcher.jar
Everything in the directory containing the version of ant-launcher.jar that's
  running, i.e. everything in ANT_HOME/lib
All JAR files in $
{user.home}
/.ant/lib
Directories and JAR files supplied via the -lib command line option.
Everything in the CLASSPATH variable unless the -noclasspath option is used.

(2) implies that users on shared machines may have to install their own
version of ant in order to get around these problems, assuming that the
administrator has install the ivy.jar in $ANT_HOME/lib
