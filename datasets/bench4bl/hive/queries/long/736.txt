MetaStoreUtil's get_fields(), which is offered through the Hive Server interface, does not include the partition field in its returned list of fields. This may be related to JIRA-671. At the moment, there is no way for a Hive client to discover a partition column in a table, creating a big issue for anyone who wishes to query a partitioned table.
