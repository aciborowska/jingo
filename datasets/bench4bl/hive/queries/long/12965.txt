In Hive, "insert overwrite local directory" first deletes the overwritten directory if exists, recreate a new one, then copy the files from src directory to the new local directory. This process sometimes changes the permissions of the to-be-overwritten local directory, therefore causing some applications no more to be able to access its content.
