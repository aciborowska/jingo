The query "SELECT count(1) as cnt from src x"  has some problems, even though nullgroup*.q passed in tests. 
Will check and solve it in this jira.
A wrong plan sometimes can be generated due to some unknow factor:
Wrong plan:

STAGE PLANS:

  Stage: Stage-1

    Map Reduce

      Alias -> Map Operator Tree:

        x 

            Select Operator

              Reduce Output Operator

                sort order: 

                tag: -1

      Reduce Operator Tree:

        Group By Operator

          aggregations:

                expr: count(VALUE._col0)

          mode: complete

          Select Operator

            expressions:

                  expr: _col0

                  type: bigint

            File Output Operator

              compressed: false

              GlobalTableId: 0

              table:

                  input format: org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TextInputFormat

                  output format: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat



  Stage: Stage-0

    Fetch Operator

      limit: -1



Without unknow factor, correct plan can be generated:

STAGE PLANS:

  Stage: Stage-1

    Map Reduce

      Alias -> Map Operator Tree:

        x 

            Select Operator

              Group By Operator

                aggregations:

                      expr: count(1)

                mode: hash

                Reduce Output Operator

                  sort order: 

                  tag: -1

                  value expressions:

                        expr: _col0

                        type: bigint

      Reduce Operator Tree:

        Group By Operator

          aggregations:

                expr: count(VALUE._col0)

          mode: mergepartial

          Select Operator

            expressions:

                  expr: _col0

                  type: bigint

            File Output Operator

              compressed: false

              GlobalTableId: 0

              table:
