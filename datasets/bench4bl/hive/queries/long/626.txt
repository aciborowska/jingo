There is a type cast error in Join operator. Produced by the following steps:



create table zshao_foo (foo_id int, foo_name string, foo_a string, foo_b string,

foo_c string, foo_d string) row format delimited fields terminated by ','

stored as textfile;



create table zshao_bar (bar_id int, bar_0 int, foo_id int, bar_1 int, bar_name

string, bar_a string, bar_b string, bar_c string, bar_d string) row format

delimited fields terminated by ',' stored as textfile;



create table zshao_count (bar_id int, n int) row format delimited fields

terminated by ',' stored as textfile;





Each table has a single row as follows:



zshao_foo:

1,foo1,a,b,c,d



zshao_bar:

10,0,1,1,bar10,a,b,c,d



zshao_count:

10,2



load data local inpath 'zshao_foo' overwrite into table zshao_foo;

load data local inpath 'zshao_bar' overwrite into table zshao_bar;

load data local inpath 'zshao_count' overwrite into table zshao_count;



explain extended

select zshao_foo.foo_name, zshao_bar.bar_name, n from zshao_foo join zshao_bar on zshao_foo.foo_id =

zshao_bar.foo_id join zshao_count on zshao_count.bar_id = zshao_bar.bar_id;



The case is from David Lerman.
