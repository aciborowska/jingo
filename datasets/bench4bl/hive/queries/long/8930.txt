create temporary table xx (call_duration string, call_type string) stored as orc;



insert into table xx values (null, "X"), ("0", "X"), ("1", "X"), (null, "y");



SELECT

   ROUND(sum(cast(COALESCE(call_duration, 0) as int))/60, 2) as SwitchMOU

from xx

GROUP BY call_type;



triggers the wrong cast, which results in a NULL, since the coalesce() has no resolved return type - it is either a STRING or an INT.
