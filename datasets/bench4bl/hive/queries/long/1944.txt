If dynamic partition insert generates multiple partitions and some partitions need to be merge (MR task) and some need not (move task), parallel execution could cause the move task finish first and created the partition directory (say ds=1) first. When the MR job finished, it created a different directory (ds=1_1) for the same partition ds=1.
