create database db with dbproperties ('hive.metastore.warehouse.dir' = 'loc');

The above command does not set location of 'db' to 'loc'. It instead creates 'db.db' under the warehouse directory configured in hive-site.xml of CLI. Looks conflicting with HIVE-1820's expectation. If scratch dir is specified here, that is honoured.
