When running a query similar to the following:
"insert overwrite table outputtable select a, b, cast(sum(counter) as INT) from tablea join tableb on (tablea.username=tableb.username) join tablec on (tablec.userid = tablea.userid) join tabled on (tablec.id=tabled.id) where insertdate >= 'somedate' and insertdate <= 'someotherdate' group by a, b;"
Where one table is ~40gb or so and the others are a couple of hundred mb. The error happens in the first mapred job that processes the 40gb.
I get the following exception (see attached file for full stack trace):
Caused by: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: java.io.IOException: Stream closed.
        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.FileSinkOperator.process(FileSinkOperator.java:162)
It happens in one reduce task and is reproducible, running the same query gives the error.
