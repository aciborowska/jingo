I've executed this "LOAD DATA" statement a number of times before and never had this issue. When I drop into the shell, I can see the file I'm trying to load. Hive can't, however; any ideas on what's going on? I'd love to get tips on how to debug this problem as well.
hive > LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'ml-data/u.data' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE u_data;                 
FAILED: Error in semantic analysis: line 3:23 Invalid Path 'ml-data/u.data': No files matching path
hive > !ls ml-data;
