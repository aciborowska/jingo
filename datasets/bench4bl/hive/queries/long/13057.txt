For a partitioned table, each PartitionDesc has a copy of corresponding TableDesc.
While TableDesc is mutable and hence cannot be interned, it's property values can be.
For a simple select on a table with 100K partitions, this cut total number of String instances by ~65%.
Most replicated strings were location, serde, input/output format, column, types, table name, etc.
