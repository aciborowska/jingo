Noticed that the output of the join is displayed wrongly for queries involving more than one table and mixture of left and outer joins, with different join conditions.
For ex: SELECT * from T1 a RIGHT OUTER JOIN T2 b ON (a.value=b.value) LEFT OUTER JOIN T3 c ON (b.key=c.key);
displays the table T2 first, then T1 and T3.
