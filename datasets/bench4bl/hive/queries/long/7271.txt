Did some experiments to see if there's a way to speed up unit tests. TestCliDriver seemed to take a lot of time just spinning up/tearing down JVMs. I was also curious to see if running everything on a ram disk would help.
Results (I ran tests up to authorization_2):

Current setup: 40 minutes
Single JVM (not using child JVM to run all queries): 8 minutes
Single JVM + ram disk: 7 minutes

So the ram disk didn't help that much. But running tests in single JVM seems worthwhile doing.
