When using sequence files as the container format, I'd expect to be able to embed new lines in a column. However, this causes problems when the data is output if the newlines aren't manually stripped or escaped. This tends to show up as each row of output generating two (or more) rows with nulls after the column with a new line and nulls for the "empty" columns on the second row.
