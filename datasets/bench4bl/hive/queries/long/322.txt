I found the ClassLoader cannot load my UDF when doing FunctionTask, because the ClassLoader hasnot append its classpaths on-the-fly yet.
The ExecDriver' s addToClassPath(String[] newPaths) method is the only entry for ClassLoader dynamically append its classhpaths (besides hadoop's GenericOptionsParser).
But that function wasnot called before FunctionTask getting my UDF class by class name. I think this is the reason why I came across that failure.
scenario description:
I set a peroperty in hive-site.xml to configure the classpath of my udf. 
<property>
  <name>hive.aux.jars.path</name>
  <value>/home/hadoop/hdpsoft/hive-auxs/zhoumin.jar</value>
</property>
but failed to register it with a ClassNotFoundException when creating udf through the sql command.
CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION strlen AS 'hadoop.hive.udf.UdfStringLength'
I'll make a patch soon.
