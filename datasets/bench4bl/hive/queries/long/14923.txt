When comparing a DATE type with a TIMESTAMP type, the planner promotes both sides to string.  But since the DATE value does not include the hh:mm:ss[.nnnnnnnnn] the comparison produces wrong results.
Thanks to Jason Dere for observing this.
Here is a portion of an EXPLAIN output:



                      Map Join Operator

                        condition map:

                             Inner Join 0 to 1

                        keys:

                          0 UDFToString(some_timestamp) (type: string)

                          1 UDFToString(some_date) (type: string)



Workaround is to cast the DATE to a TIMESTAMP.
