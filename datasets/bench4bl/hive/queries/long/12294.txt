As far as I could tell, this should not happen because some code in Hive iterates this list in parallel with names, assuming each ID will correspond to a name; however, I've seen it in some logs recently. Either names also contain duplicates and we should remove the line, or something could be broken. Could also be different for different operators? No idea.
