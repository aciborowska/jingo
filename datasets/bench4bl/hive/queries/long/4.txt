User cannot specify utf8 strings in the query, both for selection and filtering. Mysql syntax should be followed: 
select _utf8 'string' from <TableName>
select <selectExpr> from <TableName> where col = _utf8 0x<HexValue>
To start with, utf8 strings should be supported. Support for other character sets can be added in the future on demand.
The identifiers (table name/column name etc.) cannot be utf8 strings, it is only for the data values.
Although, in create table, the user has the option of specifying sorted columns, he does not have the option of specifying whether they are ascending or descending.
Create Table syntax should be enhanced to support that.
