When creating a new table with both the EXTERNAL and LIKE clauses, the new table does not behave as an EXTERNAL table thus resulting in potential data loss.
Example:
create external table test1 (VAL string) location '/user/craig/test1';
create external table test2 like test1 location '/user/craig/test2';
drop table test1;
/user/craig/test1 - still exists
drop table test2;
/user/craig/test2 - is deleted (bad)
If I do an extended describe on both tables, test1 shows up as being external while test2 is a managed table.
