There is an existing current_user() UDF which returns the user provided by the configured hive.security.authenticator.manager. This is often the same as the user provided on connection, but some cases, like HadoopDefaultAuthenticator this could be different.
Some cases we need the logged in user independently of the configured authenticator, so a new UDF is created which provides this - returns the SessionState.get().getUserName().
