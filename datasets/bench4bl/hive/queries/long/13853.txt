There is a possibility that there may be a CSRF-based attack on various hadoop components, and thus, there is an effort to add a block for all incoming http requests if they do not contain a X-XSRF-Header header. (See HADOOP-12691 for motivation)
This has potential to affect HS2 when running on thrift-over-http mode(if cookie-based-auth is used), and webhcat.
We introduce new flags to determine whether or not we're using the filter, and if we are, we will automatically reject any http requests which do not contain this header.
To allow this to work, we also need to make changes to our JDBC driver to automatically inject this header into any requests it makes. Also, any client-side programs/api not using the JDBC driver directly will need to make changes to add a X-XSRF-Header header to the request to make calls to HS2/WebHCat if this filter is enabled.
