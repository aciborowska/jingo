Running:
mvn test -Dtest=TestCliDriver -Dqfile=join2.q -Phadoop-2
It seems hive (qtestutil) will still pick up the hadoop-1 shims, because the hadoop 1 client libs are the first thing on the classpath. I believe we used to massage the classpath to only contain 1 or 2 hadoop binaries depending on the flag.
The effect of this is that we can't really test hive on hadoop 2 right now.
