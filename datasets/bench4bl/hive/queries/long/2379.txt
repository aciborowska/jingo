  For now any Hive/HBase queries would require the following jars to be explicitly added via hive's add jar command:
add jar /usr/lib/hive/lib/hbase-0.90.1-cdh3u0.jar;
add jar /usr/lib/hive/lib/hive-hbase-handler-0.7.0-cdh3u0.jar;
add jar /usr/lib/hive/lib/zookeeper-3.3.1.jar;
add jar /usr/lib/hive/lib/guava-r06.jar;
the longer term solution, perhaps, should be to have the code at submit time call hbase's 
TableMapREduceUtil.addDependencyJar(job, HBaseStorageHandler.class) to ship it in distributedcache.
