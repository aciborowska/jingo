like textinputformat - looking for a concrete implementation to read binary records from a flat file (that may be compressed).
it's assumed that hadoop can't split such a file. so the inputformat can set splittable to false.
tricky aspects are:

how to know what class the file contains (has to be in a configuration somewhere).
how to determine EOF (would be nice if hadoop can determine EOF and not have the deserializer throw an exception  (which is hard to distinguish from a exception due to corruptions?)). this is easy for non-compressed streams - for compressed streams - DecompressorStream has a useful looking getAvailable() call - except the class is marked package private.
