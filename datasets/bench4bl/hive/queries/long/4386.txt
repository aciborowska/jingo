partitioned_table is partitioned on year, month, day.
> select max(day) from partitioned_table where year=2013 and month=4;
spins up zero mappers, one reducer, and returns NULL.  Same for
> select min(day) from ...
> select distinct(day) from... returns nothing at all.
Using an explicit intermediate table does work:
> create table foo_max as select day from partitioned_table where year=2013 and month=4;  
> select max(day) from foo_max; drop table foo_max;
Several map-reduce jobs later, the correct answer is given.
