sampling does not use internal column name, it uses column table name instead - which will not work in case there is any operator between table
scan and sampling, which is possible with column pruning.
The following test breaks: 
(assuming srcbucket has more than 1 column: in this case 2 columns: key and value)
â€“ no input pruning, sample filter
EXPLAIN
SELECT s.key
FROM srcbucket TABLESAMPLE (BUCKET 1 OUT OF 5 on key) s;
SELECT s.key
FROM srcbucket TABLESAMPLE (BUCKET 1 OUT OF 5 on key) s;
