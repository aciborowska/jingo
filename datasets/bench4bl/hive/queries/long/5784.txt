The following queries fails:



select b.key, count(*) from src b group by key

select key, count(*) from src b group by b.key



with a SemanticException; the select expression b.key (key in the 2nd query) are not resolved by the GBy RowResolver.
This is because the GBy RowResolver only supports resolving based on an AST.toStringTree match. Underlying issue is that a RowResolver doesn't allow multiple mappings to the same ColumnInfo.
