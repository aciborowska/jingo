semicolons in sql comments cause a parse error when trying to execute the query via hive -f
As an example, this query runs fine:
 – a safe comment
 select * from table;
but this query
 – an unsafe comment;
 select * from table;
results in:
FAILED: Parse Error: line 0:-1 cannot recognize input '<EOF>'
