ScriptOperator uses a second thread to output the rows to the children operators. In a corner case which contains a union, 2 threads might be outputting data into the same operator hierarchy and caused race conditions.



CREATE TABLE tablea (cola STRING);

SELECT *

FROM (

    SELECT TRANSFORM(cola)

    USING 'cat'

    AS cola

    FROM tablea

  UNION ALL

    SELECT cola as cola

    FROM tablea

) a;
