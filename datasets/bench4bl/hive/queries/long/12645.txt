Currently, it seems that we look to match the ColumnInfo between the parent and the child rowschemas by calling rci = rs.getColumnInfo(tblAlias, alias) which might be a bit aggressive. i.e. we will lose opportunity to constant propogate even if the columns are the same but the alias in the rowschemas do not match. We need to introduce additional checks to see if the columns can be mapped to constants from parents.
