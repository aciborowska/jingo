For producing the correct filenames for bucketed tables, there is a method in Utilities.java that extracts out the task id from the filename and replaces it with the bucket number. There is a bug in the regex that is used to extract this value for attempt numbers >= 10:



>>> re.match("^.*?([0-9]+)(_[0​-9])?(\\..*)?$", 'attempt_201107090429_6496​5_m_001210_10').group(1)

'10'

>>> re.match("^.*?([0-9]+)(_[0​-9])?(\\..*)?$", 'attempt_201107090429_6496​5_m_001210_9').group(1)

'001210'
