If a partition name contains characters such as ':' and '|' which have special meaning in URI (hdfs uses URI internally for Path), CombineHiveInputFormat throws an exception. URI was created in CombineHiveInputFormat to compare a path belongs to a partition in partitionToPathInfo. We should bypass URI creation by just string comparisons.
