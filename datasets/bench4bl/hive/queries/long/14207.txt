HIVE-12338 introduced a new web ui, which has a page that displays the current HiveConf being used by HS2. However, before it displays that config, it does not strip entries from it which are considered "hidden" conf parameters, thus exposing those values from a web-ui for HS2. We need to add stripping to this.
