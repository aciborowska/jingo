 HiveServer2 should support configurable the server side socket read timeout and TCP keep-alive option. Metastore server already support this (and the so is the old hive server). 
We now have multiple client connectivity options like Kerberos, Delegation Token (Digest-MD5), Plain SASL, Plain SASL with SSL and raw sockets. The configuration should be applicable to all types (if possible).
