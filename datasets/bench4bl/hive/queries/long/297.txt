The following query:
FROM (
    FROM (FROM my_table
         SELECT CAST(userid AS BIGINT) AS userid a
   SELECT userid
   UNION ALL
   FROM (FROM my_table
         SELECT CAST(userid AS STRING) AS userid) b
   SELECT userid
   ) unioned
   SELECT DISTINCT userid;
Is accepted by the parse, but throws the following at run-time:
java.lang.RuntimeException: org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.SerDeException: java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Long cannot be cast to java.lang.String
(Note that this seems less silly if the inner queries are different tables with userid stored as a bigint and a string, respectively)
I have interpreted this as a bug in the parser, but it could also be viewed as a bug about not auto-casting.
This can be worked around by using explicit CAST statements.
