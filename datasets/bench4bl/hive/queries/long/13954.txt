Parquet uses java util logging. When java logging is not configured using default logging.properties file, parquet's default fallback handler writes to STDOUT at INFO level. Hive writes all logging to STDERR and writes only the query output to STDOUT. Writing logs to STDOUT may cause issues when comparing query results. 
If we provide default logging.properties for parquet then we can configure it to write to file or stderr.
