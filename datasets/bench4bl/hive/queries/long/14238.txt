When creating external table with SQL authorization, we require RWX permission + ownership of the table location. If the location doesn't exist, we check on parent dir (recursively), which means we require the user owns everything under parent dir. I think this is not necessary - we don't have to check ownership of parent dir, or we just check non-recursively.
