If a job fails, Hive currently displays a link to the task with the most number of failures for easy access to the error logs. However, generating the link may require many RPC's to get all the task completion events, adding a delay of up to 30 minutes. This patch adds a configuration variable to control whether the link is generated. Turning off this feature would also disable automatic debugging tips generated by heuristics reading from the error logs.
