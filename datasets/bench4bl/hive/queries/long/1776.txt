A query (that i can't reproduce verbatim) submits a job to a MR cluster with a plan file that is resident on  the local file system. This job obviously fails.
This seems to result from an interaction between the parallel execution (which is trying to run one local and one remote job at the same time). Turning off either the parallel execution mode or the auto-local mode seems to fix the problem.
