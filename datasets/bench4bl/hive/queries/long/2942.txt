After HIVE-2792, the substr function produces a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when called on a string containing UTF-8 characters without the length argument being present.
E.g.
select substr(str, 1) from table1;
now fails with that exception if str contains a UTF-8 character for any row in the table.
