...this also returns null for "$.Form Name" and "$.Form Name". It should return the relevant key.
Removing the space works fine, however, spaces are allowed as JSON keys (see spec at http://www.json.org/ ). As such, this is a bug.
Claiming that this is org.json's problem, or something similar, does not solve this bug. It's Hive that claims this gets a JSON object, so it needs to provide the JSON object.
