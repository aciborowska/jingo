LazySimpleSerDe.initSerdeParams hard-codes the level of separators to 8, causing structures with more than that level of nestedness to fail.
Doubling this value to 16 allowed me to read an extremely nested structure. This code was added in HIVE-337 and reading through the jira I can't see a reason 8 was chosen, other than it seemed like a reasonable value. Any reason not to double this, or allow the user to configure via a property?
