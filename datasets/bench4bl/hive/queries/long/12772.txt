HIVE-12063 changed the output of decimal values to pad zeros to the column's full scale for Hive CLI.
It looks like Beeline and JDBC still have the old behavior that strips trailing 0s.
Beeline:

+---------------+---------------+--+

|      c1       |      c2       |

+---------------+---------------+--+

| 1.9999999999  | 1.9999999999  |

| 9.9999999999  | 9.9999999999  |

+---------------+---------------+--+



HiveCli:

1.99999999990	1.9999999999

9.99999999990	9.9999999999
