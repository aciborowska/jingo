Currently the data type  of "grant_time" is defined as "bigint", if writing "String" to the field in output, it will case to bigint by force, the output will print a "null" at the grantTime field, This blocks a conponent like SENTRY, who want to custom the output of show grant, a simple patch to fix it. About the default format of grant_time's output in HIVE will discuss in HIVE-9018
