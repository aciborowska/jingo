globStatus expects a regular expression,  so if there is special characters (like '{' , '[') in the filepath, this function will fail.
We should be able to replace this call with listStatus easily since we are not passing regex to replaceFiles(). The only places replaceFiles is called is in loadPartition and Table's replaceFiles.
