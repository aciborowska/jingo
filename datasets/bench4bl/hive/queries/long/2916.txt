Hi
I am using Hive-0.8.1.  I am trying to get type information for table columns from MetaStore.  The Developer documentation says the components of ql/typeinfo is responsible for this.
i.e, under the query processor section in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/DeveloperGuide#DeveloperGuide-QueryProcessor
  However the directory "typeinfo" is missing in hadoop/hive/ql.I understand from typeinfo has java files that is responsible for getting all struct fieldnames, categories, primitive types. etc.
