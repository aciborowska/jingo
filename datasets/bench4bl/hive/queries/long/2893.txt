I am trying to change Metastore configuration from Derby to MySQL. All the Docs which is available in Hive says that I have to change ConnectionURL, UserName, Password of hive/conf/hive-site.xml file. But problem there is no hive-site.xml file in Hive 0.8.1 stable release download. Rather it has file called hive-default.xml.template. Which also says,
<Unable to render embedded object: File (-- WARNING) not found.!! This file is provided for documentation purposes ONLY!     -->
<Unable to render embedded object: File (-- WARNING) not found.!! Any changes you make to this file will be ignored by Hive. -->
<Unable to render embedded object: File (-- WARNING) not found.!! You must make your changes in hive-site.xml instead.       -->   
But no hive-site.xml file in the conf directory of release. Please some one update a clear documentation how to change derby db to MySQL.
