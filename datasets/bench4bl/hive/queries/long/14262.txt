For partitioned table operations, a Table WriteEntity is being added to the list to be authorized if there is a partition in the output list from semantic analyzer. 
However, it is being added with a default WriteType of DDL_NO_TASK.
The new Table WriteEntity should be created with the WriteType of the partition WriteEntity.
