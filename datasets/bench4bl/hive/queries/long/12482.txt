When execution.engine=tez,set mapreduce.job.name does not work.
In Tez mode, the default job name is "Hive_"+Sessionid ,for example HIVE-ce5784d0-320c-4fb9-8b0b-2d92539dfd9e .It is difficulty to distinguish job when there are too much jobs .
A better way is to set the var of mapreduce.job.name .But set mapreduce.job.name does not work!
