a few problems:

if a job is retired - then counters cannot be obtained and a stack trace is printed out (from history code). this confuses users
too many calls to getCounters. after a job has been detected to be finished - there are quite a few more calls to get the job status and the counters. we need to figure out a way to curtail this - in busy clusters the gap between the job getting finished and the hive client noticing is very perceptible and impacts user experience.

calls to getCounters are very expensive in 0.20 as they grab a jobtracker global lock (something we have fixed internally at FB)
