Example:
select count(1) from <bucket_table> TABLESAMPLE(BUCKET xxx out of yyy) where <partition_column> = 'xxx'
will not trigger input pruning.
The reason is that we assume sample filtering operator only happens as the second filter after table scan, which is broken by HIVE-1538, even if the feature doesn't turn on.
