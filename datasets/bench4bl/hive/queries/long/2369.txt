There is a minor typo issue in HiveConnection.java (jdbc) :

throw new SQLException("Could not establish connecton to "

            + uri + ": " + e.getMessage(), "08S01");

It seems like there's a "i" missing.
I know it's a very minor typo but I report it anyway. I won't attach a patch because it would be too long for me to SVN checkout just for 1 letter.
