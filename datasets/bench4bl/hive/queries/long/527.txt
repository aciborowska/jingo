The following piece of code should fail but it succeeded - and it deletes all existing partitions of zshao_p.



CREATE TABLE zshao_p (a string) PARTITIONED BY (ds string);

INSERT OVERWRITE table zshao_p SELECT 1 from zshao_tt;



It should output an error saying that the partition key/value pair is not specified.
