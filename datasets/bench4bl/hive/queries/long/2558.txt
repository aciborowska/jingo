I may be missing something, but:
After performing:
create table rrt (r timestamp);
insert into table rrt select '1970-01-01 00:00:01' from src limit 1;
Following queries give undesirable results:
select * from rrt where r in ('1970-01-01 00:00:01');
select * from rrt where r in (0); 
select * from rrt where r = 0; 
select * from rrt where r = '1970-01-01 00:00:01';
At least for the first two, the reason may be the lack of timestamp in numericTypes Map from FunctionRegistry.java (591) . Yet whether we really want to have a linear hierarchy of primitive types in the end, is another question.
