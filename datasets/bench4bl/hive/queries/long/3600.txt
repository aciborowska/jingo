"SHOW TABLES" doesn't list tables under user created databases. Only tables under [default] database are shown.
1) "SHOW TABLES" must provide list of all tables under each database in the form db_name.table_name
2) Enhance "SHOW TABLES" to support "SHOW TABLES db_name" to list only the tables from db_name
