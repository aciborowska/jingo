When we generate the ReduceSInkOperator, the partition columns are empty, which means all the rows will get a hash value of 0, and they will all go to the first reducer.
In the meanwhile we are fixing this bug, please use "CLUSTER BY" instead of "SORT BY" so that the data will get distributed to multiple reducers.
