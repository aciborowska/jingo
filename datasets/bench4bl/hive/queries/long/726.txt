After HIVE-487, users will have to specify the versions as in "shims/ivy.xml" to make "ant package -Dhadoop.version=<version>".work.
Currently it is only running fine with the following versions (from shims/ivy.xml): 0.17.2.1, 0.18.3, 0.19.0, 0.20.0.
We used to do "ant package -Dhadoop.version=0.17.0" but it's not working any more, although we can specify "ant package -Dhadoop.version=0.17.2.1" and the package will probably still work with 0.17.0.
