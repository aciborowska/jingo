There's no way to use semicolons in a string in a given query. The CLI will to a String.split() at semicolons and as a result if we need to do another queries such as: select food_items from groceries where name like '%apples; bananas; oranges;%', then it will return an error because of a badly formatted query. There should be a way to escape semicolons in strings when that is the intention.
