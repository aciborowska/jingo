CLI documentation for Hive exists in two places (wikidocs and xdocs) and both of the versions are out of date, but the xdocs version was worse: 

http://hive.apache.org/docs/r0.9.0/language_manual/cli.html
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Cli

A revised CLI wikidoc is available and will soon be exchanged for the old wikidoc. Although there's some resistance to moving more of the wikidocs into xdocs, for now let's have current information in both places instead of removing the xdocs version.
