Beeline tool requires to have "new line" at the end of a Hive/Impala SQL script otherwise the last statement will be not executed or NullPointerException will be thrown.

If a statement ends without end of line AND semicolon is on the same line then the statement will be ignored; i.e.

select * from TABLE;<EOF>

 will be not executed
If a statement ends without end of line BUT semicolon is on the next line then the statement will be executed, but ;java.lang.NullPointerException will be thrown; i.e.

select * from TABLE

;<EOF>

 will be executed, but print ;java.lang.NullPointerException
If a statement ends with end of line regardless where semicolon is then the statement will be executed; i.e.

select * from TABLE;

<EOL><EOF>

or

select * from TABLE

;<EOL><EOF>

will be executed
