Renaming an external partition will change the location of that partition to the default location of a managed partition with the same name.
E.g. If ex_table is external and has partition part=1 with location /.../managed_table/part=1
Calling ALTER TABLE ex_table PARTITION (part = '1') RENAME TO PARTITION (part = '2');
Will change the location of the partition to /.../ex_table/part=2
