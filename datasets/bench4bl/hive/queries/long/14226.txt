The patch for HIVE-12590 has modified the string tree representation of an ASTNode, so that everything except string literals are now lowercase.
However CalcitePlanner#genSelectLogicalPlan is still checking the occurrence of an uppercase TOK_FUNCTIONDI constant in the string tree.
(Line 2997 in CalcitePlanner on master)
I think this check will never evaluate to true, so we should either be using a lowercase String, or remove the check if it is unnecessary.
