So far I haven't been able to push the maven artifacts to the Apache release repository. Here's the error I get:

% ant maven-publish -Dmvn.publish.repo=releases

...

maven-publish-artifact:

I get the same error when I try to publish to the staging repository.
I took another look at the Apache "Publishing Maven Artifacts" guide (http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html) and think that we're probably failing to include a couple fields that are required in the pom files. It also looks like we should be pushing this to the staging repository as opposed to the releases repository.
