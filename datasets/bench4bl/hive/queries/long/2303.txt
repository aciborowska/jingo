The following is from one of our users:
create external table impressions (imp string, msg string)
  row format delimited
    fields terminated by '\t'
    lines terminated by '\n'
  stored as textfile                 
  location '/xxx';
Some strings in my data contains Control-A, Control-B etc as internal delimiters.  If I do a
Select * from impressions limit 10;
All fields were able to print correctly.  However if I do a
Select * from impressions where msg regexp '.*' limit 10;
The fields were broken by the control characters.  The difference between the 2 commands is that the latter requires a map-reduce job.
