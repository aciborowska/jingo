Right now the 'reload function' is handled specially in HiveCommand#find:



        return null;

      } else if(command.length > 1 && "reload".equalsIgnoreCase(command[0])

          && "function".equalsIgnoreCase(command[1])) {

        //special handling for SQL "reload function"

        return null;

      }



However, this means the hive.security.command.whitelist doesn't work for the command. It's better to first do the privilege check and then the rest.
