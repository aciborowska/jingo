hadoop (0.20.2, 1.x, 2.x) appends HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS to HADOO_OPTS. 
So it is unnecessary to have this statement in bin/hive, under debug mode -
"  export HADOOP_OPTS="$HADOOP_OPTS $HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS"
It results in the HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS being appended twice, resulting in this error in debug mode.



bin/hive --debug
