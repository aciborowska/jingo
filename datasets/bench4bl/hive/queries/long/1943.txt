Currently, metastore operations with associated hdfs operations like drop_partition doesn't do a rollback if the hdfs operation fails. The metastore first updates the metadata, and then tries to do hdfs operation. If the hdfs operation fails for any reason, the data on the hdfs will be orphaned. We should improve the situation.
