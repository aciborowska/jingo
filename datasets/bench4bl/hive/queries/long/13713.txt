E.g. vectorization_limit.q doesn't vectorize Reducer 2 for the query:



"select ctinyint, count(distinct(cdouble)) from alltypesorc group by ctinyint order by ctinyint limit 20"



It was producing a stack trace with this error... when trying to vectorize the COMPLETE mode GROUP BY operator.



Vector aggregate not implemented: "count" for type: "NONE (reduce-merge-partial = true)
