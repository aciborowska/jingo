The testutils/metastore/metastore-upgrade-test.sh script takes the list of scripts to execute for the DB upgrade from the folder itself (metastore/scripts/upgrade/DB_NAME). Currently it fails as it executes upgrade-1.2.0-to-1.3.0 followed by upgrade-1.2.0-to-2.0.0.
Instead, it should use the content of the upgrade.order.DB_NAME file.
