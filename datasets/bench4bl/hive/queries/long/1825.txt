hive-default.xml sets hive.metastore.local to true. In the code however there is this:
HiveMetaStoreClient.java


boolean localMetaStore = conf.getBoolean("hive.metastore.local", false);



This leads to different behaviour depending on whether hbase-default.xml is on the classpath or not.....which can lead to some confusion 
I can supply a patch - should be pretty similar. I just don't  know what the "real" default should be. My guess would be true.
