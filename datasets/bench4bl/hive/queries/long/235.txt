The current DynamicSerDe code assumes all fields are there and no fields are missing.
However Thrift Protocols can have missing fields, in case the field is null.
In that case, DynamicSerDe may commit 2 behavior:
1. array index out of bound error because DynamicSerDe assumes the number of fields in the record should be equal to that in the DDL;
2. fields with null values will take the value from the last record. This may produce wrong result for queries.
In order to fix this, we need to:
1. Pass ObjectInspector/TypeInfo recursively so that we know the number of fields when deserializing the record.
2. Clear out fields that are missing from the record.
