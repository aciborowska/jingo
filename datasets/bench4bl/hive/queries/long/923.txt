HADOOP-5759 is committed to Hadoop 0.20 on 19/Oct/09 but not released yet.
We should not use CombineHiveInputFormat for hadoop 0.20 for now. Otherwise all users will encounter problems using Hive trunk against Hadoop 0.20.
We can switch the default back when a new release from hadoop 0.20 comes out.
