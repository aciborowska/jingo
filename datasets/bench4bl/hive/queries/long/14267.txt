When an operation gets timed out, it is removed from handleToOperation hash map in OperationManager.removeTimedOutOperation(). However OPEN_OPERATIONS counter is not decremented. 
This can result in an inaccurate open operations metrics value being reported. Especially when submitting queries to Hive from Hue with close_queries=false option, this results in misleading HS2 metrics charts.
