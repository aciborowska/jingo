The current lpad and rpad don't support the multibyte character at "str" and "pad".
For example, we can see the following result.



hive> select name from sample1;

OK

tokyo

ＴＯＫＹＯ

hive> select lpad(name, 20, '*') from sample1;

OK

***************tokyo

*****ＴＯＫＹＯ



This is improved as follows.



hive> select lpad(name, 20, '*') from sample1;

***************tokyo

***************ＴＯＫＹＯ
