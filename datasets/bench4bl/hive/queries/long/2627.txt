When a query is converted into a map join, and it depends on some UDF (ADD JAR...; CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION...), then an NPE may happen.  Here is an example.
SELECT
    some_udf(dummy1) as dummies
FROM (
    SELECT        
        a.dummy as dummy1,
        b.dummy as dummy2
    FROM        
        test a    
    LEFT OUTER JOIN
        test b
    ON
        a.dummy = b.dummy
) c;
My guess is that the JAR classes are not getting propagated to the hashmapjoin operator.
