Insert Overwrite table db.tname fails if partition already exists.
For example-
insert overwrite table db.tname PARTITION(part='p') select .. from t2 where part='p'; fails if partition 'p' already exists. Workaround is - use db; and the fire the command.
From the source code-
alterPartition(tbl.getTableName(), new Partition(tbl, tpart)); takes String tablename as argument and loses db information. Table table = newTable(tablename) is called to retrieve table from name. But, it relies on currentDatabase value (hence the workaround).
