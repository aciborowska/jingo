If a hive query has multiple map-reduce jobs, the job names are sometimes not correct.
For example, for a query with 3 stages, it should be:
Query (1/3)
Query (2/3)
Query (3/3)
but it is always 
Query (1/3)
looks some bug in Driver.java.
Also, it would be good to add mapred.job.submitClient which can be obtained from StringUtils.getHostName
