As is evident from above, the outputs are not populated at all at compile time.
This may create a problem for many components that depend on outputs: locking, authorization etc.
However, the exact set of outputs may be needed for some other components (for example. the
internal deployment in Facebook has a replication hook which is used for replication which needs the
exact set of outputs). It may  be a good idea to extend WriteEntity to include a flag which indicates
whether the output is complete or not, and then the hook can look at that flag if needed
