HIVE-3764 added support for doing a version consistency check between the Hive JARs on the classpath and the metastore schema in the backend database. This is a nice feature, but it currently doesn't work for well for folks who appending the release version with their own suffixes, e.g. "0.12.0.li_20".
We can fix this problem by modifying MetaStoreSchemaInfo.getHiveSchemaVersion() to match against ^\d+\.\d+\.\d+ and ignore anything that remains.
