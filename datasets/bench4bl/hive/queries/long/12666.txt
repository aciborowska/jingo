Introduced by HIVE-11634. The original idea in HIVE-11634 was to remove the IN partition conditions from the predicate list since the static dynamic partitioning would kick in and push these predicates down to metastore. However, the check is too aggressive and removes events such as below :



-                    Select Operator

-                      expressions: UDFToDouble(UDFToInteger((hr / 2))) (type: double)

-                      outputColumnNames: _col0

-                      Statistics: Num rows: 1 Data size: 7 Basic stats: COMPLETE Column stats: NONE

-                      Group By Operator

-                        keys: _col0 (type: double)

-                        mode: hash

-                        outputColumnNames: _col0

-                        Statistics: Num rows: 1 Data size: 7 Basic stats: COMPLETE Column stats: NONE

-                        Dynamic Partitioning Event Operator

-                          Target Input: srcpart

-                          Partition key expr: UDFToDouble(hr)

-                          Statistics: Num rows: 1 Data size: 7 Basic stats: COMPLETE Column stats: NONE

-                          Target column: hr

-                          Target Vertex: Map 1
