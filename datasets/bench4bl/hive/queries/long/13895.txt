To avoid the too verbose app state report, HIVE-13376 increases the state check interval to a default 60s. However, bigger interval brings considerable start-up wait time for yarn-client mode.
Since the state report only exists in yarn-cluster mode, we can disable it using spark.yarn.submit.waitAppCompletion.
