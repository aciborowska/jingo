Just go into the CLI and type "describe [TABLE_NAME]". If a comment has multiple lines, it is completely unreadable due to poor comment indenting. For example:
birthdayParam         string             1 = comment1
2 = comment2
3 = comment3
But it supposed to display as:
birthdayParam         string             1 = comment1
                                         2 = comment2
                                         3 = comment3
Comments should be indented the same amount on each line, i.e., if the comment starts at row k for the first line of the comment, it should be indented by k on line 2.
