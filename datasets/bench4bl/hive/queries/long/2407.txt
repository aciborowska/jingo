In the checkPaths method of Hive.java, a new destination filename will be chosen if the source filename already exists in the destination directory.  This new filename follows the simple schema of adding _copy_N to the source filename (with increasing N until a non-existing filename is found).
If the file has been LZO compressed it is imperative that the extension remain ".lzo" so that the LZO indexer can find it and create a corresponding index file.  It would be much better to use a prefix of "copy_N_" or insert "_copy_N" somewhere else in the filename.
Without this, Hive and LZO compression will not work when identical source filenames are inserted into Hive.
