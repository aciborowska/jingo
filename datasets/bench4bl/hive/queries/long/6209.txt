In case where user loads data into table using overwrite, using a different file, it is not being overwritten.



$ hdfs dfs -cat /tmp/data

aaa

bbb

ccc

$ hdfs dfs -cat /tmp/data2

ddd

eee

fff

$ hive

hive> create table test (id string); 

hive> load data inpath '/tmp/data' overwrite into table test;

hive> select * from test;

aaa

bbb

ccc

hive> load data inpath '/tmp/data2' overwrite into table test;

hive> select * from test;

aaa

bbb

ccc

ddd

eee

fff



It seems it is broken by HIVE-3756 which added another condition to whether "rmr" should be run on old directory, and skips in this case.
There is a workaround of set fs.hdfs.impl.disable.cache=true; 
which sabotages this condition, but this condition should be removed in long-term.
