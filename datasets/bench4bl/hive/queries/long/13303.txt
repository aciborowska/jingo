RowContainer::setupWriter, HybridHashTableContainer::spillPartition, (KeyValueContainer|ObjectContainer)::setupOutput, VectorMapJoinRowBytesContainer::setupOutputFileStreams create files in tmp. Maybe some other code does it too, those are the ones I see on the execution path. When there are multiple YARN output directories and multiple tasks running on a machine, it's better to use the YARN directories. The only question is cleanup.
