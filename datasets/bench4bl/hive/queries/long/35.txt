Some of the users have reported inconsistencies in the hive tutorial and the actual supported syntax. Some of these issues are as follows:
1. Tutorial refers to SMALLINT which is not supported currently in the Query Language.
2. References to INSERT INTO instead of INSERT OVERWRITE in the section on udfs.
