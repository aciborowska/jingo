Currently I am seeing ivy retrieve for 4 times, each time for 4 of the hadoop versions.
It takes a long time.



ivy-retrieve-hadoop-source:

[ivy:retrieve] :: Ivy 2.0.0-rc2 - 20081028224207 :: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ ::

:: loading settings :: file = /hive/trunk/VENDOR.hive/trunk/ivy/ivysettings.xml

[ivy:retrieve] :: resolving dependencies :: org.apache.hadoop.hive#shims;working@zshao.com

[ivy:retrieve]  confs: [default]

[ivy:retrieve]  found hadoop#core;0.17.2.1 in hadoop-source

[ivy:retrieve]  found hadoop#core;0.18.3 in hadoop-source

...



We should fix this problem. Also it will help if we can add an option "offline" like what hadoop has.
