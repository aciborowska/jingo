1. Map-only job : same input
   Hangs because mapper tries to same open twice, and hadoop filesystem complains.
   Fix: Only initialize once - keep state at the Operator level for the same. Should do same for Close.
2. Map-only job : different inputs
   Loss of data due to rename.
   Fix: change rename to move files to the directory.
3. Map-only job in subquery + RedSink: works currently
4. 2 variables: so 4 sub-cases
   Number of sub-queries having map-reduce jobs. (1/2)
   Operator after Union (RS/FS)
a.   Number of sub-queries having map-reduce jobs. 1
     Operator after Union: RS
     Can be done in 2MR - really difficult with current infrastructure.
     Should do with 3 MR jobs now - break on top of UNION. 
     Future optimization: move operators between Union and RS before Union.
b.   Number of sub-queries having map-reduce jobs. 2
     Operator after Union: RS
     Needs 3MR - Should do with 3 MR jobs - break on top of UNION. 
     Future optimization: move operators between Union and RS before Union.
c.   Number of sub-queries having map-reduce jobs. 1
     Operator after Union: FS
     Can be done in 1MR - really difficult with current infrastructure.
     Can be easily done with 2 MR by removing UNION and cloning operators between Union and FS.
     Should do with 3 MR jobs now - break on top of UNION. 
     Followup optimization: 2MR should be able to handle
d.   Number of sub-queries having map-reduce jobs. 2
     Operator after Union: FS
     Can be easily done with 2 MR by removing UNION and cloning operators between Union and FS.
     Should do with 3 MR jobs now - break on top of UNION.
