The following query was simplified for illustration purposes. 
This works correctly:



select client_tid, "" as myvalue1, "" as myvalue2 from clients cluster by client_tid



The intent here is to produce two empty columns in between data.
The following query does not work:



select distinct client_tid, "" as myvalue1, "" as myvalue2 from clients cluster by client_tid




FAILED: Error in semantic analysis: Line 1:44 Repeated key in GROUP BY ""



The key is not repeated since the aliases were given. Seems like Hive is ignoring the aliases when the "distinct" keyword is specified.
