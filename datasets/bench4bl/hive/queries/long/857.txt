The following code fails at runtime, because the "clicked" field produced by "transform" is actually of type String at runtime, instead of boolean.



INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE feature_index

SELECT

 temp.feature,

 temp.ad_id,

 sum(if(temp.clicked, 1, 0)) / cast(count(temp.clicked) as DOUBLE) as clicked_percent

FROM (

 SELECT concat('ua:', trim(lower(ua.feature))) as feature, ua.ad_id, ua.clicked

 FROM (

  MAP raw_logs.user_agent, raw_logs.ad_id, raw_logs.clicked

  USING 'my.py' as (feature STRING, ad_id STRING, clicked BOOLEAN)

  FROM raw_logs

 ) ua

) temp

GROUP BY temp.feature, temp.ad_id;
