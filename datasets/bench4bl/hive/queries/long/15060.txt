WARN jdbc.HiveConnection: Request to set autoCommit to false; Hive does not support autoCommit=false.
Transaction isolation: TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ
0: jdbc:hive2://ctr-e89-1466633100028-0275-01
By default, this beeline setting is false, while hive only support autoCommit=true for now. So this warning does mot make sense and should be removed.
