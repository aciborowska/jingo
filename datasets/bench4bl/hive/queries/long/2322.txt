We store metadata about ColumnarSerDes in the metastore, so it should be considered a native SerDe.  Then, column information can be retrieved from the metastore instead of from deserialization.
Currently, for non-native SerDes, column comments are only shown as "from deserializer".  Adding ColumnarSerDe to the list of native SerDes will persist column comments.  See HIVE-2171 for persisting the column comments of custom SerDes.
