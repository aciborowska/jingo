The following does not work:
create table T -> default location dfs1
insert overwrite T partition (ds='1') select * from src;
alter table T location 'dfs2';
insert overwrite T partition (ds='1') select * from src;
It tries to insert back in dfs1 - due to which the move task fails.
It would be cleaner to keep the same semantics as fileformat - whenever a partition is being inserted into, it
inherits the properties from the table. So, after the insert, the partition should belong to dfs1.
It does not matter whether the partition exists before or not,.
