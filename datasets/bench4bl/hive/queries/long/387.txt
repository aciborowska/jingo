hadoop uses a uri for the file system that first does a reverse resolution of the fs.default.name ip address section (in case ip address is used). hive uses the un-resolved one. this causes url mismatch exceptions in load command (for example - localhost.localdomain does not match 127.0.0.1).
fix is to use the uri given back by the filesystem object.
