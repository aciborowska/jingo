Every time I start up the Hive CLI with logging enabled I'm treated to the following ERROR log messages courtesy of DataNucleus:



DEBUG metastore.ObjectStore: datanucleus.plugin.pluginRegistryBundleCheck = LOG 

ERROR DataNucleus.Plugin: Bundle "org.eclipse.jdt.core" requires "org.eclipse.core.resources" but it cannot be resolved. 

ERROR DataNucleus.Plugin: Bundle "org.eclipse.jdt.core" requires "org.eclipse.core.runtime" but it cannot be resolved. 

ERROR DataNucleus.Plugin: Bundle "org.eclipse.jdt.core" requires "org.eclipse.text" but it cannot be resolved.



Here's where this comes from:

The bin/hive scripts cause Hive to inherit Hadoop's classpath.
Hadoop's classpath includes $HADOOP_HOME/lib/core-3.1.1.jar, an Eclipse library.
core-3.1.1.jar includes a plugin.xml file defining an OSGI plugin
At startup, Datanucleus scans the classpath looking for OSGI plugins, and will attempt to initialize any that it finds, including the Eclipse OSGI plugins located in core-3.1.1.jar
Initialization of the OSGI plugin in core-3.1.1.jar fails because of unresolved dependencies.
We see an ERROR message telling us that Datanucleus failed to initialize a plugin that we don't care about in the first place.

I can think of two options for solving this problem:

Rewrite the scripts in $HIVE_HOME/bin so that they don't inherit ALL of Hadoop's CLASSPATH.
Replace DataNucleus's NOnManagedPluginRegistry with our own implementation that does nothing.
