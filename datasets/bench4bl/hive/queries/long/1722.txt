In the test case mapjoin1.q :
SELECT  /*+ MAPJOIN(b) */ sum(a.key) as sum_a FROM srcpart a JOIN src b ON a.key = b.key where a.ds is not null;
The current result in mapjoin1.q.out shows the result is 76260.0
But actually, if user remove the map join hint, and run the query:
SELECT  sum(a.key) as sum_a FROM srcpart a JOIN src b ON a.key = b.key where a.ds is not null;
The result is 1114788.0
And I import these input data into mysql to test, and test result is also 1114788.0.
Obviously, the current result is not correct
