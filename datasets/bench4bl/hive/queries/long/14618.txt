Beeline has a thread that fetches logs from HS2. However, it uses the same HiveStatement object to also wait for query completion using a long-poll (with default interval of 5 seconds).
The jdbc client has a lock around the thrift api calls, resulting in the getLogs api blocking on the query completion check. ie the logs would get shown only every 5 seconds by default.
