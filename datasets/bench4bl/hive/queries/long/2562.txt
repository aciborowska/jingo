HIVE-2247 Added a parameter to alter_partition in the Metastore Thrift API which has been causing compatibility issues with some scripts.  We would like to change this to have two methods, one called alter_partition which takes the old parameters, and one called something else (I'll leave the naming up to you) which has the new parameters.  The implementation of the old method should just call the new method with null for the new parameter.
This will fix the compatibility issues.
