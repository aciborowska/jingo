we are trying out a version of hadoop local mode that runs multiple mappers/reducers by spawning jvm's for them. In this mode hive mappers fail in reading the plan file. it seems that we assume (in the setMapredWork call) that local mode mappers/reducers will run in the same jvm (we can cache the current plan in a global var and don't serialize to a path). this needs to get fixed.
