In some of the recent test runs, we are seeing multiple bindings for SLF4j that causes issues with LOG4j2 logger. 



SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/grid/0/hadoop/yarn/local/usercache/hrt_qa/appcache/application_1454694331819_0001/container_e06_1454694331819_0001_01_000002/app/install/lib/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.10.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]



We have added explicit exclusions for slf4j-log4j12 but some library is pulling it transitively and it's getting packaged with hive libs. Also hive currently uses version 1.7.5 for slf4j. We should add dependency convergence for sl4fj and also remove packaging of slf4j-log4j12.*.jar
