Renaming a partition changes the location of the partition to the default location of the table, followed by the partition specification.  It should just change the partition specification of the path.
If the path does not end with the old partition specification, we should probably throw an exception because renaming a partition should not change the path so dramatically, and not changing the path to reflect the new partition name could leave the partition in a very confusing state.
