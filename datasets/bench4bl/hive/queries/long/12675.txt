As more and more subcomponents of Hive (Tez, Optimizer) etc are using PerfLogger to track the performance metrics, it will be more meaningful to set the PerfLogger logging level to DEBUG. Otherwise, we will print the performance metrics unnecessarily for each and every query if the underlying subcomponent does not control the PerfLogging via a parameter on its own.
