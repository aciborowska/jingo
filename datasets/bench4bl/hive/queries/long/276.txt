The plan ql/src/test/results/clientpositive/input3_limit.q.out shows that there are 2 map-reduce jobs:
The first one is distributed and sorted as is specified by the query. The reducer side has LIMIT 20.
The second one (single reducer job imposed by LIMIT 20) does not have the same sort order, so the final result is non-deterministic.
