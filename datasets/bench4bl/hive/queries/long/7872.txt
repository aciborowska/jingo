When dropping a table partition, StorageBasedAuthorizationProvider is checking for write permission on the partition directory itself to check if the user is allowed to drop the partition. However to delete the partition directory, you really need write perms on the parent directory of the file you are going to delete. So SBA will authorize the user to drop the partition but actually deleting the partition directory will fail if the user does not have the correct access on the table (parent) directory.
SBA should also check the parent directory for DROP actions during its auth check.
