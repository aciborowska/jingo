After the application of HIVE-2362, we're unable to run queries against the Hive cluster (RC2 and 3):

java.io.IOException: Failed to set permissions of path: /user/jhoman-667872320/.staging to 0700

        at org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileUtil.checkReturnValue(FileUtil.java:680)

        at org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileUtil.setPermission(FileUtil.java:653)

        at org.apache.hadoop.fs.RawLocalFileSystem.setPermission(RawLocalFileSystem.java:483)

        at org.apache.hadoop.fs.RawLocalFileSystem.mkdirs(RawLocalFileSystem.java:318)

        at org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.JobSubmissionFiles.getStagingDir(JobSubmissionFiles.java:116)

this is due to all the hadoop confs not being loaded and the LocalJobRunner (which builds staging directories in this manner) being used instead of the regular one. It's also not possible to access the hdfs since no default fs is specified.  
Reverting 2362 fixes this, but I've not yet looked at that patch to see the exact cause.
