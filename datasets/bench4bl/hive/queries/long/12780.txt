I executed !history command in beeline. And the following results displayed.



Beeline version 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT by Apache Hive

beeline> !history

1.    0: select

1.    1: select

1.    2: select

1.    3: select



As a result, "1." is not necessary to output. I will change the output, such as the following.



Beeline version 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT by Apache Hive

beeline> !history

0: select

1: select

2: select

3: select
