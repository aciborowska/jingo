The issue occurs when try to query table when restarting ec2 cluster (will get diff server ip), currently the warehouse dir is hardcoded as some internal ip. 
It failed after retrying the old location:

Is there a way to set the warehouse.dir manually for the already existent db? Otherwise all tables have to be created again... 
Thanks,
