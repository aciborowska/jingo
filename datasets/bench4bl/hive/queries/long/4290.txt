Building is definitely taking longer with hcat, hs2 etc in the build. When you're working on one area of the system though, it would be easier to have an option to only build that. Not for pre-commit or build machines, but for dev this should help.
ant clean package build OR
ant -Dbuild.profile=full clean package test --> build everything
ant -Dbuild.profile=core clean package test --> build just enough to run the tests in ql
ant -Dbuild.profile=hcat clean package test --> build only hcatalog
