For a random UDF, we should be able to use * or a.* to refer to "all of the columns in their natural order." This is not currently implemented.
I'm reporting this as a bug because it is a manner in which Hive is inconsistent with the SQL spec, and because Hive claims to implement *.
hive> select all_non_null(a.*) from table a where a.ds='2012-09-01';
FAILED: ParseException line 1:25 mismatched input '*' expecting Identifier near '.' in expression specification
