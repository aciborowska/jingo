When running hive as a service and running a high number of queries concurrently I end up with multiple threads running at 100% cpu without any progress.
Looking at these threads I notice this thread(484e):
at org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.ObjectStore.getMTable(ObjectStore.java:598)
But on a different thread(63a2):
at org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.model.MStorageDescriptor.jdoReplaceField(MStorageDescriptor.java)
