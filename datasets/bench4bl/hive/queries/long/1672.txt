executing a join query where one of the tables is a fact table would fail during table scan of the fact table. This usually happens when one of the tasks is scanning large number of rows (say 200 thousand rows in my case) and the task fails to respond in the timeout window.
The workaround for this is to set a very large timeout for task. I could manage to run the query by setting the timeout to 0. (infinite) 
To repro :
Run a join query with couple of tables of which one is a fact table. In my env, the fact table has 40TB data with more than a Billion rows. Most of the map tasks are processing over 200 thousand rows. 
Few of the task takes more than 30 min to respond and fail since the default task timeout if 10 min..
