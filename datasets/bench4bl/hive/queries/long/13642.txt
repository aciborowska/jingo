According to the instruction of using Review Board, we can create a review request by running the following command:



$ rbt post



However, if we use current version of RBTools (0.7.6), above command doesn't work because the values accepted to the option "--guess-fields" was updated since 0.6.



$ rbt --version

RBTools 0.7.6

$ rbt post

ERROR: Invalid value "true" for argument "--guess-fields"



It is better to update the value of GUESS_FIELDS option in .reviewboardrc to avoid this error.
