When a MR job fails, the JobDebugger tries to construct the job tracker URL by connecting to the job tracker, but that is better done by using RunningJob#getTrackingURL.
Also, it tries to construct URLs to the tasks, which is not reliable, because the job could have been retired and the URL would not work.
