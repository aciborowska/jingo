Yongqiang tried this and it fails in local mode:
add file ../data/scripts/dumpdata_script.py;
select count(distinct subq.key) from
(FROM src MAP src.key USING 'python dumpdata_script.py' AS key WHERE src.key = 10) subq;
this needs to be fixed because it means we cannot choose local mode automatically in case of transform scripts (since different paths need to be used for cluster vs. local mode execution)
