I was trying to run the tests using the instructions above.
I was able to run them using a single machine (parallelism of 4 in ~2 hours).
The conf. file is as follows: .hive_ptest.conf

{

  "qfile_hosts": [

    ["root@<MC>", 4]

  ],



  "other_hosts": [

  ["root@<MC>", 1]

  ],



  "master_base_path": "/data/users/tmp",

  "host_base_path": "/data/users/hivetests",

  "java_home": "/usr/local/jdk-6u24-64"



}
