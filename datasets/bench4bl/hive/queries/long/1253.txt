date_sub('2010-03-15', 7) returns '2010-03-07'. This is because we have time shifts on 2010-03-14 for daylight saving time.
Looking at ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/UDFDateSub.java, it is getting a calendar instance in UTC time zone.
def calendar = Calendar.getInstance(TimeZone.getTimeZone("UTC"));
And use calendar.add() to substract 7 days, then conver the time to 'yyyy-MM-dd' format.
If it simply uses default timezone, the problem is solved: "def calendar = Calendar.getInstance());"
When people use date_sub('2010-03-15', 7), I think they mean substract 7 days, instead of substracting 7*24 hours. So it should be an easy fix. The same changes should go to date_add and date_diff
