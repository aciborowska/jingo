Select/Group by/Filter/etc need to return the same name whether they are the regular or the vector operators. If they don't the regular path matching in our optimizer code doesn't work on them.
From the code it looks an attempt was made to follow this - unfortunately getOperatorName is static and polymorphism doesn't work on these functions.
