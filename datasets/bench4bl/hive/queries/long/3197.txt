Hi, I've been trying to compile Hive trunk from source and getting failures:



    [javac] hive-svn/jdbc/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/jdbc/HiveCallableStatement.java:48: error: HiveCallableStatement is not abstract and does not override abstract method <T>getObject(String,Class<T>) in CallableStatement

    [javac] public class HiveCallableStatement implements java.sql.CallableStatement {

    [javac]        ^

    [javac]   where T is a type-variable:

    [javac]     T extends Object declared in method <T>getObject(String,Class<T>)



I think this is because JDBC 4.1 is part of Java 7, and is not source-compatible with older JDBC versions. Any chance you guys could add JDBC 4.1 support?
