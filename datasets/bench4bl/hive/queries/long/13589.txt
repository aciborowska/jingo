Specifying connection string using commandline options in beeline is convenient, as it gets saved in shell command history, and it is easy to retrieve it from there.
However, specifying the password in command prompt is not secure as it gets displayed on screen and saved in the history.
It should be possible to specify '-p' without an argument to make beeline prompt for password.
