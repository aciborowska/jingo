The Hive 0.14.0 release depends on SNAPSHOT versions of tez-0.5.2 and calcite-0.9.2. I believe this violates Apache release policy (can't find the reference, but I seem to remember this being a problem with HCatalog before the merger), and it implies that the folks who tested the release weren't necessarily testing the same thing. It also means that people who try to build Hive using the 0.14.0 src release will encounter errors unless they configure Maven to pull artifacts from the snapshot repository.
