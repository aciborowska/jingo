If table referred does not use all lowercase in INSERT INTO command, the data is not appended but overwritten.
set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;
set hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
CREATE TABLE test (key int, value string) PARTITIONED BY (ds string);
SELECT * FROM test;
INSERT INTO TABLE test  PARTITION (ds) SELECT key, value, value FROM src;
SELECT * FROM test;
The following statement works as expected. The data from src is appended to test
SELECT * FROM test;
INSERT INTO TABLE test  PARTITION (ds) SELECT key, value, value FROM src;
SELECT * FROM test;
The following is copied from the processing log
Loading data to table default.test partition (ds=null)
        Loading partition 
{ds=1}
        Loading partition {ds=2}


The following statement does not work. Note the table name referred as Test (not test). INSERT INTO behaves like INSERT OVERWRITE

SELECT * FROM test;
INSERT INTO TABLE Test  PARTITION (ds) SELECT key, value, value FROM src;
SELECT * FROM test;

The following is copied from the processing log

Loading data to table default.test partition (ds=null)
Moved to trash: hdfs://localhost:8020/hive/warehouse/test/ds=1
Moved to trash: hdfs://localhost:8020/hive/warehouse/test/ds=2
        Loading partition {ds=1}
        Loading partition 
{ds=2}
