The issue was introduced in HIVE-12159 (https://github.com/apache/hive/blame/master/ql/src/test/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/orc/TestRecordReaderImpl.java). This test deletes target/tmp directory. Because of this, the subsequent tests don't get to read target/tmp/conf/hive-site.xml, which contains test-specific configurations. Also, target/tmp has metastore db directory, which also gets deleted causing subsequent tests that use metastore db to fail too. 
I'm surprised this issue wasn't caught in pre-commit builds. Sergio Pe√±a I see that even the latest pre-commit jobs aren't reporting any errors, while building on local and running hive-exec test cases causes a bunch of tests to fail.
