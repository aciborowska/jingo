Given the following table:
CREATE TABLE `Y` (`y` DOUBLE) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\001' STORED AS TEXTFILE;
The following query fails:
SELECT  `Y`.`y`  FROM `Y`  WHERE  ( `y` = 1 )
ERROR: java.sql.SQLException: Query returned non-zero code: 10, cause: FAILED: Error in
       semantic analysis: Line 1:36 Ambiguous table alias or column reference '`y`'
ERROR: Unable to execute Hadoop query.
ERROR: Prepare error. SQL statement: SELECT  `Y`.`y`  FROM `Y`  WHERE  ( `y` = 1 ).
The problem goes away if the table and column names do not match.
