The following code works differently in 0.5.0 vs 0.7.0.
In 0.5.0 the partition location is respected. 
However in 0.7.0 while the initial partition is create with the specified location "<path>/parta", the "insert overwrite ..." results in the partition written to "<path>/dt=a" (note that <path> is the same in both cases).



create table foo_stg (bar INT, car INT); 

load data local inpath 'data.txt' into table foo_stg;

 

create table foo4 (bar INT, car INT) partitioned by (dt STRING) LOCATION '/user/hive/warehouse/foo4'; 

alter table foo4 add partition (dt='a') location '/user/hive/warehouse/foo4/parta';

 

from foo_stg fs insert overwrite table foo4 partition (dt='a') select *;



From what I can tell HIVE-1707 introduced this via a change to
org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.loadPartition(Path, String, Map<String, String>, boolean, boolean)
specifically:



+      Path partPath = new Path(tbl.getDataLocation().getPath(),

+          Warehouse.makePartPath(partSpec));

+

+      Path newPartPath = new Path(loadPath.toUri().getScheme(), loadPath

+          .toUri().getAuthority(), partPath.toUri().getPath());



Reading the description on HIVE-1707 it seems that this may have been done purposefully, however given the partition location is explicitly specified for the partition in question it seems like that should be honored (esp give the table location has not changed).
This difference in behavior is causing a regression in existing production Hive based code. I'd like to take a stab at addressing this, any suggestions?
