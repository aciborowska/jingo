ZK model has authentication and authorization mixed together, so it's impossible to set up acls that would carry over between unsecure and secure clusters in the normal case (i.e. work for a specific users no matter the authentication method).
To support cluster updates from unsecure to secure, we'd need to change the ACLs ourselves.
