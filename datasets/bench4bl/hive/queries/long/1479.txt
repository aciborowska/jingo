hive.exec.post.hooks is not listed in hive-default.xml. Also, the description of hive.exec.pre.hooks should be changed since this property is not specific to tests:



<property>

  <name>hive.exec.pre.hooks</name>

  <value></value>

  <description>Pre Execute Hook for Tests</description>

</property>
