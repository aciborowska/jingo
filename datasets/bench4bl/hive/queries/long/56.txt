For some Hive stuff, I ran into the following scenario:
For a given map-reduce job, the input was empty. Because of that no mappers and reducers were created. It would have been helpful if an empty output for the reducer would have been created.
After browsing though the code, it seems that in initTasks() in JobInProgress, no mappers and reducers are initialized if input is empty.
I was thinking of putting a fix there. If the input is empty, before returning, create the output directory (as specified by the reducer) if needed.Any comments/suggestions....
