fetch task code should be refactored so that can be used somewhere else also.
Currently, fetch task has a lot of code to deal with reading a hive table (both partitioned and non-partitioned). That should be in some common location like utilities, so that it can be used by other components also.
In case of map joins, similar functionality will be needed.
