Hive on Spark yarn-cluster mode.
After setting "set spark.yarn.queue=QueueA;" ,
run the query "select count from test"  3 times and you will find  3 different yarn applications.
Two of the yarn applications in FINISHED & SUCCEEDED state,and one in RUNNING & UNDEFINED state waiting for next work.
And if you submit one more "select count from test" ,the third one will be in FINISHED & SUCCEEDED state and a new yarn application will start up.
