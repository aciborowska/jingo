The automatic index usage does not check whether or not the indexes are still up-to-date when generating the index queries. This can be addressed in two stages, the first is to add a check before generating the index query to ensure that the index is still valid. The next stage may be to add some sort of mode where indexes are automatically updated on table writes.
