                    SELECT b.*  
                    FROM                                                 
                    (                                                    
                      SELECT x.col1, x.col2
                      FROM tmp x              
                      WHERE x.col2= 10
                      CLUSTER BY col2                                  
                    ) b"
The above query works, but if I change the cluster by to:
CLUSTER BY x.col2, 
it croaks.
