Paul, I somehow missed this while reviewing 655 and merged the generated file OperatorType.java
Please change:
/ql/if/queryplan.thrift:
enum OperatorType 
{ JOIN, MAPJOIN, EXTRACT, FILTER, FORWARD, GROUPBY, LIMIT, SCRIPT, SELECT, TABLESCAN, FILESINK, REDUCESINK, UNION }

add UDTF here, and generate thrift files again. sorry about missing this
