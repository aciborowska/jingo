When running multi-insert queries, when one of the query is not returning results, the other query is not returning the right result.
For example:
After following query, there is no value in /tmp/emp/dir3/000000_0

From (select * from src) a

insert overwrite directory '/tmp/emp/dir1/'

select key, value

insert overwrite directory '/tmp/emp/dir2/'

select 'header'

where 1=2

insert overwrite directory '/tmp/emp/dir3/'

select key, value 

where key = 100;



where clause in the second insert should not affect the third insert.
