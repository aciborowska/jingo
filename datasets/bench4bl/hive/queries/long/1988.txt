The 'owner' of any delegation token issued by the MetaStore is set to the requesting user. When a delegation token is asked by the user himself during a job submission, this is fine. However, in the case where the token is requested for by services (e.g., Oozie), on behalf of the user, the token's owner is set to the user the service is running as. Later on, when the token is used by a MapReduce task, the MetaStore treats the incoming request as coming from Oozie and does operations as Oozie. This means any new directory creations (e.g., create_table) on the hdfs by the MetaStore will end up with Oozie as the owner.
Also, the MetaStore doesn't check whether a user asking for a token on behalf of some other user, is actually authorized to act on behalf of that other user. We should start using the ProxyUser authorization in the MetaStore (HADOOP-6510's APIs).
