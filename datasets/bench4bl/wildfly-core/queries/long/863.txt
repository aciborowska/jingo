'You are disconnected at the moment. Type 'connect' to connect to the server or 'help' for the list of supported commands.' This line is printed by CLIAeshConsoleCallback() after every entered line when the CLI is not connected to the controller.
It used to be printed at the beginning of the session and in case the CLI looses the connection.
I wouldn't insist on keeping it like it used to be, btw. But I guess it makes sense to have some hint-warning like that.
