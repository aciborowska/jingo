ConfigurationFile.successfulBoot() creates a temp file when persistOriginal is false. It locates it in the same directory as mainFile, but in the !persistOriginal case, mainFile may point to any location, not necessarily to something in the configuration dir, and its directory may not be writable by the WildFly process.
