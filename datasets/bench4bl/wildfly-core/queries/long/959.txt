NodeSubregistry is always passing 'false' as the runtimeOnly param for ConcreteResourceRegistrations it creates.
The param isn't actually needed, since the ResourceDefinition is also a param, and the value can be pulled from it.
Also, since we now have proper facilities for setting up a runtimeOnly ResourceDefinition, the MRR.setRuntimeOnly() method should be deprecated and all core uses of it converted.
