    public void connect() {
        checkAlreadyConnected();
        try 
{

            ctx = CommandContextFactory.getInstance().newCommandContext();

            ctx.connectController();

        }
 catch (CliInitializationException e) 
{

            throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to initialize command context.", e);

        }
 catch (CommandLineException e) 
{

            throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to connect to controller.", e);

        }
    }
also applicable to the other connects of course.
If the connection fails in the connect method, a subsequent connect will hit:
    private void checkAlreadyConnected() 
{

        if (ctx != null) throw new IllegalStateException("Already connected to server.");

    }

and will fail for the wrong reason... as while ctx !=null is true, but the connection had failed.
ergo, upon failure in connect, the ctx should be reset to avoid this
