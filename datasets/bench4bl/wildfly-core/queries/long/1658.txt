JBEAP-2830 includes changes to the logging subsystem's template.xml that EAP full relies upon. These were never forward ported to upstream, meaning that EAP builds can't consume core 2.2 or later.
I believe there's no problem applying the changes. EAP will use one of the supplements while WildFly will not.
