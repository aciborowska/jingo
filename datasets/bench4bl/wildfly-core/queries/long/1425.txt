EmbeddedHostControllerFactory:282, authCode is being used as the hostname. This is reset if the name is present in the xml config, but since the default -slave.xml has no name, the hostname is displayed as the contents of authCode.
We should probably extract the hostname code from HostControllerEnvironment:300 into its own method, and use that.
