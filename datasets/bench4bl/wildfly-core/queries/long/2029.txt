I am not able to correctly configure native management interface to use Elytron. 
I am adding some binding for native interface:






/socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=native:add(port=9999)







And then adding native management interface which uses Elytron sasl-authentication-factory (application-sasl-authentication is predefined in standalone-elytron.xml):






/core-service=management/management-interface=native-interface:add(sasl-authentication-factory=application-sasl-authentication,socket-binding=native)




{




    "outcome" => "failed",




    "failure-description" => {




        "WFLYCTL0412: Required services that are not installed:" => ["org.wildfly.security.sasl-authentication-factory"],




        "WFLYCTL0180: Services with missing/unavailable dependencies" => ["jboss.remoting.server.management is missing [org.wildfly.security.sasl-authentication-factory]"]




    },




    "rolled-back" => true




}







Following exception occurs in server log:






ERROR [org.jboss.as.controller.management-operation] (management-handler-thread - 2) WFLYCTL0013: Operation ("add") failed - address: ([




    ("core-service" => "management"),




    ("management-interface" => "native-interface")




]) - failure description: {




    "WFLYCTL0412: Required services that are not installed:" => ["org.wildfly.security.sasl-authentication-factory"],




    "WFLYCTL0180: Services with missing/unavailable dependencies" => ["jboss.remoting.server.management is missing [org.wildfly.security.sasl-authentication-factory]"]




}

WFLYCTL0184:    New missing/unsatisfied dependencies:

The same exception is thrown when I am trying to set SSL through Elytron ssl-context attribute in management native-interface.
