When the CLI is connected to the controller, patch info reflects the outcome of read-resource operation. It could be basic info or extended (--verbose).
In the offline mode though, the only information available is the basic one. It is actually limited by the tool's API, which means it never meant to support --verbose.
This difference is not reflected in the help content of the command and simply looks like an inconsistent behavior of the same command depending on the connection status.
Another issue with the offline mode is that, the current version was not propagated to the CLI and would always read "Unknown" for the user.
