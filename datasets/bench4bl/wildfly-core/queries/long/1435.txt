If a SuperUser performs for example this:






/core-service=management/access=audit/in-memory-handler=y:add   




/core-service=management/access=audit/in-memory-handler=y:write-attribute(name=max-history,value=50)







then a Monitor user shouldn't be able to see this in the configuration change log (as decided in EAP7-89), because he doesn't even have the permission to "read" the manipulated resource.. But actually he can see it:






/core-service=management/service=configuration-changes:list-changes




{




    "outcome" => "success",




    "result" => [




        {




            "operation-date" => "2016-03-15T08:40:25.807Z",




            "access-mechanism" => "NATIVE",




            "remote-address" => "127.0.0.1/127.0.0.1",




            "outcome" => "success",




            "operations" => [{




                "operation" => "write-attribute",




                "address" => [




                    ("core-service" => "management"),




                    ("access" => "audit"),




                    ("in-memory-handler" => "y")




                ]




            }]




        },




        {




            "operation-date" => "2016-03-15T08:40:25.809Z",




            "access-mechanism" => "NATIVE",




            "remote-address" => "127.0.0.1/127.0.0.1",




            "outcome" => "success",




            "operations" => [{




                "operation" => "add",




                "address" => [




                    ("core-service" => "management"),




                    ("access" => "audit"),




                    ("in-memory-handler" => "y")




                ]




            }]




        }




    ]




}
