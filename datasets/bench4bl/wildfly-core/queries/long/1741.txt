The rules around streams in responses are:
1) If the thing providing the stream is an attribute, the attribute value set by the read OperationStepHandler must be the uuid of the stream.
2) If the thing providing the stream is a custom operation like :read-content, the result value in the response must be the uuid of the stream or a complex result object one of whose fields is the uuid of the stream.
Metadata about streams is propagated to the client using a response-header. But since a particular request can result in more than one attached stream, the normal non-response-header part of the result for a step must provide the uuid of the stream set by that step. This allows the client to correlate the various streams with the steps that provided them.
