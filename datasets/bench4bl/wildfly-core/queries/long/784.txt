bin/standalone.sh does not use "shift" correctly when parsing commandline option, failing with "bin/standalone.sh: 34: shift: can't shift that many" if "--debug" without a parameter is used on dash (default shell in debian)
Second issue is that the script does not handle correctly situation when CDPATH environment variable is set, failing completely.
Attaching patch that fixes both these issues.
