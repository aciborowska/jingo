ConfigurationChangeResourceRemoveHandler is calling ConfigurationChangesCollector.deactivate() in its constructor. So deactivate gets called at early boot when the ConfigurationChangeResourceDefinition class gets loaded and the maxHistory is still 0, but never thereafter.
A reload won't cause it to get called again either, as ConfigurationChangeResourceDefinition is only constructed when the static INSTANCE member is initialized.
