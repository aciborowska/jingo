The HTTP handling for the management API supports caching of read-resource-description and read-operation-description responses. But the ETag calculation used in support of this is broken. It was written to calculate an MD5 hash of the toString() representation of a DMR response but the object being hashed got changed to an OperationResponse. The toString() representation of that is unique for each request.
