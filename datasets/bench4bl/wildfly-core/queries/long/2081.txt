Documentation of scan-enabled attribute in $JBOSS_HOME/docs/schema/jboss-as-deployment-scanner_2_0.xsd is 
Flag indicating that all scanning (including initial scanning at startup) should be disabled.
This is confusing. Please change it to something like 
Flag indicating if all scanning (including initial scanning at startup) should be enabled or disabled.
