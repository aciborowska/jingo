Problem: 
If you start "service.bat install" in e.g. in C:\Program Files (x86)\wildfly-9.0.1.Final\bin\service you will get:
Using the X86-64bit version of prunsrv
"\wildfly-9.0.1.Final\domain\log" can not be used syntatically at this point (don't know if it is correct, I translated it from german. Original it is "kann syntaktisch an dieser Stelle nicht verarbeitet werden.")
Cause:
This is because of the ) in "Program Files (x86)" and this is a problem because in the service.bat in line 175 and 179 (set LOGPATH=%JBOSS_HOME%\domain\log and LOGPATH=%JBOSS_HOME%\standalone\log- in version 9.0.1 and 9.0.2 - in Version 10 it may be in another line) path is not set in double quotation marks.
All other paths are set in double quotation marks.
Solution:
Set the variable and path in double quotation marks:
set "LOGPATH=%JBOSS_HOME%\...\log"
