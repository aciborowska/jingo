Consider the following sequence of operations:

:list-clear(name=attribute)
:list-get(name=attribute, index=0)
:list-add(name=attribute, value=test)
:list-get(name=attribute, index=0)

#2 will return <undefined> as expected.  The expected result of #4 is "test".  However, it returns <undefined>.  This is because #2 will create the missing element at index 0 causing #3 to operate on index 1.
