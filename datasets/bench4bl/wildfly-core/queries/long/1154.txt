The permgen size attributes no longer do anything in a core 2.0 or later server, as we require JDK 8 and our code ignores these if JDK 8 or later is running. So we should deprecate the config elements and log a message if they are used, and add deprecation text in the xsd.
I considered only deprecating these attributes if they appear in the host=* tree, and not doing the ones for domain-wide resources, since those could be used for legacy slaves running JDK < 8. But I think the distinction isn't worth the effort. First, these things are deprecated in all cases in the sense that they may go away in some future release. And second, all that happens is an INFO message is logged, and the chances that message may help some JDK 8 user offsets the chance that a JDK < 8 user would be annoyed by some spurious INFO logging.
