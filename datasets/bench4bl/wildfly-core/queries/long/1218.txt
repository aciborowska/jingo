Connecting to a controller via a new CommandContext always init a new console which could lead into "OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread" as initBasicConsole() creates a pair of Aesh thread which are not cleaned up with terminateSession(). 






import org.jboss.as.cli.scriptsupport.CLI;




Â 




CLI cli = CLI.newInstance();




for (int i = 1; i <= tries; i++) {




            cli.connect();




            cli.disconnect();




}







Reproducer waits for 10s after every 50 connections, that's where the steps on the graph comes from:
