A really old commit[1] had the effect that both exploded and zipped deployments in the deployments/ dir are treated as unmanaged content. The original intent was zipped content should be uploaded to the content repo.
This may be ok as I haven't heard about issues it causes. Emmanuel Hugonnet noted that there's an issue with JSP compilation work files from an deployment with a later timestamp not getting discarded if the scanner file has an older timestamp, but that is more an issue with how the JSP compilation work files are maintained than a problem with the scanner creating unmanaged deployments. Switching to managed deployments would fix that, but only for archives.
