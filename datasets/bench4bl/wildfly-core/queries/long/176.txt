This is the request which is generated by the xml parser
{"operation" => "add",
"type" => "user",
"name" => "$local",
"address" => [
("core-service" => "management"),
("access" => "authorization"),
("role-mapping" => "SuperUser"),
"include",
"user-$local"
]
include and user-$local are added separately, not as a pair.
ManagementXml.parseRole(...) line 3345 adds include
then parsePrincipal(...) line 3428 adds the alias.
