I happened to notice this in a server log:
11:53:48,854 ERROR [org.jboss.as.controller.management-operation] (management-handler-thread - 3) WFLYCTL0013: Operation ("resolve-expression") failed - address: ([]) - failure description: "WFLYCTL0211: Cannot resolve expression 'expression \"$
{unresolvable}\"' â€“ java.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to resolve expression: ${unresolvable}
"
That failure shouldn't end up in the server log; it's just a client mistake unrelated to server operation.
A guess is that it's logged because the OFE has the ISE attached as a cause, in which case a simple fix is to not attach the ISE, which adds no value.
Note the handler has a catch block above the one that throws this OFE that handles a SecurityException case. In that case it may be appropriate for something to appear in the logs, assuming tracing how the SE can happen indicates it could be triggered by a user fishing for an exploit. In that case a direct WARN in the log from the ResolveExpressionHandler instead of attaching the SE to the OFE and letting the OperationContext log an ERROR may be more appropriate.
