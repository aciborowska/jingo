Description of problem:
Having a domain with a single server group and two eap hosts (all on localhost), following system property cause server to fail on startup:
<property name="org.jbpm.designer.perspective" value="$
{org.jbpm.designer.perspective:full}
"/>
The problem occurs only in definition with possibility to override default value - <property name="X" value="$
{Y:default}
"/>, where X = Y
Please see the error message in attached server log excerpt.
More interesting is the fact that the issue shows with domain mode only, standalone mode works with properties defined as above.
