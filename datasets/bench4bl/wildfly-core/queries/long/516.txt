When the projects
    mail-ear from the Seam example mail [1]
    tasks-ear from the Seam example tasks [2]
are imported into JBDS the error
Attribute 'name' is not allowed to appear in element 'sub-deployment'
will be shown for the file jboss-deployment-structure.xml.
It is caused by the bug in jboss-deployment-structure-1_0.xsd; see AS7-1345
This bug should be IMHO ignored and the error shouldn't be shown.
