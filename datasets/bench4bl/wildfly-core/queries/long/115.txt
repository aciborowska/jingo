It is always possible this is in code I have added to the CLI so feel free to assign it back if that turns out to be the case 
Steps: -

Start wildfly-core
Start the CLI and connect to the local server, either with -c or connect command.
Shut down server with Ctrl-C and start again
Enter command in CLI

Result: -






[standalone@localhost:9990 /] connect




Failed to handle 'connect': java.lang.NullPointerException







Restarting the CLI it is able to connect.
