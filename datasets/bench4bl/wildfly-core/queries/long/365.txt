The usages of min/max-occurs in the model description are not consistent - e.g. missing in ResourceDescription, mostly wrong when used in the descriptionProvider or outdated examples in the documentation.
I'll attach a simple patch which should actually fix that issue in line with the documentation [1] (incl. recursive usage) and the usage of the CLI (ls -l). However there might be more to it.
