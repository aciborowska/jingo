If a CLI operation contains an attribute that does not exist the resulting error message is not very informative:
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] :reload(adminonly=true)
Failed to handle ':reload(adminonly=true)': java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
The error message should inform the user that the attribute they specified was incorrect.
