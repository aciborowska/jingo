The client jar jboss-cli-client.jar is missing the org.jboss.threads classes, even though those are a dep of ModelControllerClient.
Perhaps the CLI's call paths don't use those classes, but that's an accident waiting to happen, plus it prevents use of this jar as a general purpose management client, when otherwise it could be used that way.
