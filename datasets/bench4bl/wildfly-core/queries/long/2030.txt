I am not able to add native management interface with both sasl-authentication-factory and security-realm attributes. According to comments in EAP7-545 Analysis document [1] setting both of them is valid configuration. However CLI consider this combination as invalid (when running server with standalone-elytron.xml):






/core-service=management/management-interface=native-interface:add(sasl-authentication-factory=application-sasl-authentication,security-realm=ApplicationRealm,socket-binding=management-http)




{




    "outcome" => "failed",




    "failure-description" => "WFLYCTL0105: sasl-authentication-factory is invalid in combination with security-realm",




    "rolled-back" => true




}
