I have recently updated one of our resource definitions and missed updating one of the subsystem templates so currently have the following error reported: -






Message: WFLYCTL0376: Unexpected attribute 'security-domain' encountered. Valid attributes are: 'http-authentication-factory, override-deployment-config'




[Host Controller] 	at org.jboss.as.controller.parsing.ParseUtils.unexpectedAttribute(ParseUtils.java:128)







Previously my resource has been using the 'security-domain' attribute for it's name but now has been reverted to using 'name' for the name - in the above error message 'name' should have been listed as one of the valid attributes.
