Description of problem:
EJB CLient was configured with DNS FQDN to configure access to a remote EJB. If run a simple test adding an entry in /etc/hosts file pointing that FQDN to localhost for tests everything works. However, after finish the tests and remove the entry, the client still connects to localhost instead of resolve the new IP address. Even adding networkaddress.cache.ttl=30 inside security settings didn't work too.
How reproducible:
Everytime you use DNS names to connect to a remote EJB.
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure a simple client that connects to a remote EJB using dns name
2. add an entry in /etc/hosts mapping the dns name to localhost
3. run the client code
4. remove the entry in /etc/hosts
5. run the client code again
Actual results:
EJB remote is still reached from localhost
Expected results:
After changing DNS record EJB will be reached in this new address
