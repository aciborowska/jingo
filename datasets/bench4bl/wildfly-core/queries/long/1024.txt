JUnit dependency defined in WildFly Core is 4.11, but current WildFly-Arquillian version depends on version 4.12. It can lead to API incompatibilities and also project compilation problems (as was for instance in the PR 8200)
From my PoV is the best solution upgrade JUnit version in WF-CORE or exclude the junit:junit from the wildfly-core dependency.
