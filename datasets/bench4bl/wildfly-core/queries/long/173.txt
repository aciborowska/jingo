BindingGroupAddHandler does this in the initial step:
SocketBindingGroupResourceDefinition.validateDefaultInterfaceReference(context, model);
It actually adds a step to do other validation, so ^^^ should be moved there.
Doing this removes the requirement to run interface add ops before the socket-binding-group add ops, e.g. in non-xml-parsing based boots or in a post-boot composite operation.
