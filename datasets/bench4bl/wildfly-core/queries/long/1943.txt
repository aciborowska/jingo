When working on the management models we first need to check the last final release so that we can identify if we do need to increment the versions or not.
I had already added a clean version 4 ready for ongoing development.
Also on a related point it would be better if we can add the new version in one commit and then make changes in a subsequent commit - this way we can use various git tools to see the changes made otherwise the first set of changes are never visible.
