Current implementation of class StringBytesLengthValidator which is used by TransactionSubsystemRootResourceDefinition for validation of node-identifier element prints error message in format






Caused by: javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException: ParseError at [row,col]:[356,13]




Message: "WFLYCTL0112: '' is an invalid value for parameter node-identifier. Values must have a maximum length of 23 characters"







but the validator does not count characters of the string but bytes of the string. Then could occur if some none-ascii character are part of the node id that the string has length smaller than 23 but the message says that it's bigger.
