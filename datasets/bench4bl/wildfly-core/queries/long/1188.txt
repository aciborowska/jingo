The PR https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/pull/1268/ seemed to have introduced a regression where some times (seems to be most in my case) stty sane is required to get a shell back to normal. My guess is it's the aesh upgrade, but I'm not certain on that so I'll start the JIRA here and it can be moved to AESH if necessary.
