Quoting https://engineering.redhat.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=395596

Hi,
I was looking for info and found this page
https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/CLINon-interactiveMode [Open URL]
which appears to have been edited some months ago by someone who removed
 all commands examples, leaving only the explaining text...
clicking the "versions" link show the examples removal...
https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/CLINon-interactiveMode/diff?secondVersionNumber=3 [Open URL]
is it ok or is this an obsolete page? Is there an updated version of
the page?
Thanks

I can see some examples there, however the quote tags reminds the page was probably migrated and the migration did not work well.
