Setting up the mixed domain tests for an EAP7 slave, I get the following error :

The 'expected' is the WildFly master values, while the 'actual' are the slave values. product-name, product-version, release-codename and release-version on the slave should be the same as the master values. Once we upgrade to Wildfly Core 3.0.0 we should also check that the management-[major/minor/micro]-version attributes on the slave are the same as the DC's values as well (i.e 5.0.0 rather than 4.0.1) This is similar to WFLY-3228 back in the day.
This is probably caused by the SyncXXX handlers for pushing the domain config as operations (WFCORE-401)
