The two inner class OSHs in ModuleLoadingResourceDefinition don't deal with exceptions properly. They invoke AccessController.doPrivileged and then deal with any PrivilegedActionException by rethrowing as OperationFailedException.
OperationFailedException represents a client mistake and is handled as such (e.g. isn't logged in the server log.) It shouldn't be thrown here unless the PrivilegedActionException.getCause() value is itself an OFE. Otherwise, the OSHs should throw a RuntimeException.
