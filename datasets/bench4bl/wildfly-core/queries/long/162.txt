If the following sequence of events hapens then the Host controller process hangs and it can not be stopped using "CTRL+C" command. (only kill -9 works)

Step-1). Start the default "wildfly-9.0.0.Alpha1" in domain mode using "./domain.sh" script.  (it should start server-one, server-two, Host controller and process controller)
Step-2). Open the JConsole using "wildfly-9.0.0.Alpha1/bin/jconsole.sh" script. 
Step-3). In JConsole connect to "server-one" and then nevigate to "MBeans" tab just to check if the MBeans are  visible in jconsole or not.
Step-4). Now kill the "server-one" process using "kill  -9  $PID" command
Step-5). Once server-one is killed try stopping the Host Controller process  using "CTRL+C". Press CTRL+C in the terminal where the "./domain.sh" script is being executed. 
Users will notice that the CTRL+C signal is also not able to kill the host controller process.
