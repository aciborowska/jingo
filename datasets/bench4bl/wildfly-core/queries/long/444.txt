When I use JAVA_OPTS as an environment variable (i.e. configured before starting the AS) it's not propagated when used in domain mode on windows (domain.bat).
For standalone mode (standalone.bat) it works.
For Linux/Unix it works in both cases (standalone.sh, domain.sh).
Steps to reproduce:






SET "JAVA_OPTS=...MyOwnJavaOptsConfig..."




domain.bat







Actual result:
The configured JAVA_OPTS are not used.
Expected result:
Provided JAVA_OPTS are used for the process controller and host controller processes.
