For example:
1) ls --headers {allow-resource-service-restart <TAB>
doesn't give you the '='
2) ls --headers {allow-resource-service-restart=true; <TAB>
list you the commands one can type...not at al an header.
3) NPE caused by  WFCORE-1617
ls --headers {allow-resource-service-restart=t<TAB> ==> NPE
Completion should properly complete each header.
