ManagementPermissionAuthorizer.authorizeJmxOperation uses hard coded decision making based on the standard 7 roles. This is inflexible and specifically doesn't allow scoped roles to function properly.
I believe the JmxPermissionFactory interface needs to be redone to use permissions instead of role names. It should have an API more like org.jboss.as.controller.access.permission.PermissionFactory, with getUserPermissions and getRequiredPermissions. Something like 
PermissionCollection getUserPermissions(Caller caller, Environment callEnvironment, JmxAction action)
PermissionCollection getRequiredPermissions(JmxAction action);
Then ManagementPermissionAuthorizer.authorizeJmxOperation does a permission match check similar to what it does for management resource permissions.
