The code inside ReadResourceHandler.doExecuteInternal(OperationContext context, ModelNode operation) goes as follows:






final int recursiveDepth = operation.get(ModelDescriptionConstants.RECURSIVE_DEPTH).asInt(0);




final boolean recursive = recursiveDepth > 0 || operation.get(ModelDescriptionConstants.RECURSIVE).asBoolean(false);







The documentation states:
recursive-depth – (int) – The depth to which information about child resources should be included if recursive is {{true}. If not set, the depth will be unlimited; i.e. all descendant resources will be included.
The logic, however, as implemented goes - either recursive-depth is greater than zero OR recursive is true.
The proper implementation should be:






final int recursiveDepth = operation.get(ModelDescriptionConstants.RECURSIVE_DEPTH).asInt(0);




final boolean recursive =  operation.get(ModelDescriptionConstants.RECURSIVE).asBoolean(false) && 




                (!operation.get(ModelDescriptionConstants.RECURSIVE_DEPTH).isDefined() || recursiveDepth > 0);







The above snippet works as follows: recurs IF recursive is set AND (either recursive-depth is not defined OR recursive-depth is greater than 0).
