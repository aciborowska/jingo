        "description" => "Provides the management interface for monitoring and management of the Java virtual machine as well as the operating system on which the Java virtual machine is running. Exposes the JDK-provided JMX MBeans in the java.lang, java.nio and java.util.logging JMX domains.", ...







but java.util.logging JMX domain is not available in this service.
Not exposing those mbeans is deliberate, so change the description.
