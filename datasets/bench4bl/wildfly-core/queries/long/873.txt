Formlery we could request the ../eviction=EVICTION resource. I assume that with the resource name change a transformer kicks that redirects the request to the ../component" => "eviction resource. The response header however contains the wrong address, which prevents clients to correlate the request with the response. 
In HAL this breaks the access control mechanism.
