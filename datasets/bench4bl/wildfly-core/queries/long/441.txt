https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/blob/master/controller/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/controller/operations/global/ReadResourceDescriptionHandler.java#L427 is suspect. AFAICT that operation variable will be from the original op that triggered the multi-part request. So its address is not the address of the bit that had the failure, but the use of that address implies the intent is that it is the bit that had the failure.
Perhaps it should be resultItem.get(OP_ADDR) ?
