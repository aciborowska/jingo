$JBOSS_HOME/bin/.jbossclirc file can be used to set up CLI variables or to run a set of CLI commands at the beginning of every new CLI session. It contain a commented out CLI variable declaration part.

-# set myvar=/subsystem=datasources/data-source=myDS




+# set myvar=/subsystem=datasources/data-source=ExampleDS
