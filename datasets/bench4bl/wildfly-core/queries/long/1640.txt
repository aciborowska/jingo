DeploymentScannerUnitTestCase.testStartup() has been failing intermittently since May:
https://ci.wildfly.org/project.html?projectId=WildFlyCore&buildTypeId=&tab=testDetails&testNameId=-2364482317512802563&order=TEST_STATUS_DESC&branch_WildFlyCore=__all_branches__&itemsCount=50
The May 4 failure is the first that was not associated with some large scale failure; i.e. is more likely to be relevant to the test itself.
I'll send up a PR to @Ignore this test.
