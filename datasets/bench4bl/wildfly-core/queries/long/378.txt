Portion of the parent task related to rolling out changes to a domain.
The expectation is that single process timeouts (WFLY-2741) will handle most failure conditions related to domain rollouts (e.g. if a single server hangs, preventing completion of the rollout, eventually that server will time out, allowing the domain wide rollout to continue.) Timeouts in the domain rollout code serve as a second line of defense:
1) In case of protocol or other problems that prevent the calling process learning about the timeout on the remote process
2) In case of bugs in the single process timeout handling on the remote process
3) In mixed domain cases where remote hosts are running previous versions and do not have the timeout function
Potential places to add timeouts:
DomainSlaveHandler->HostControllerUpdateTask.ProxyOperationListener.retrievePreparedOperation()
– where the master HC waits for responses from slaves
RollingServerGroupUpdateTask.run() -> ServerTaskExecutor.ServerOperationListener.retrievePreparedOperation()
– timeout here means 1 server didn't respond, but need to move on to next
ConcurrentServerGroupUpdateTask.run() -> ServerTaskExecutor.ServerOperationListener.retrievePreparedOperation()
– timeout here means none of the remaining servers have responded w/in the timeout
DomainRolloutStepHandler.finalizeOp() -> future.get()
---- the ServerGroupUpdateTask should fail in the normal phase, so any timeout here would indicate a problem committing the tx or a comms problem getting back the response
