When using the CLI GUI to deploy a CLI archive that contains "module add" commands in its deploy.scr script, the following error message occurs:






{




    "outcome" => "failed",




    "failure-description" => "WFLYCTL0155: steps may not be null",




    "rolled-back" => true




}







The modules still get created successfully even though the above error messages appears. Note that this error only occurs when using the CLI GUI. Using the CLI without the --gui option works fine.
Deploying the attached CLI archive using the CLI GUI will result in the above error message.
