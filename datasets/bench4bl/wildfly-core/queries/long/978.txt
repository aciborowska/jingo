The build has been creating a dir in the domain tree going all the way back to very early days when it wasn't clear there wouldn't be a "deployments" dir analogous to standalone/deployments:

Since then the name of the dir has been tweaked twice as people tried to guess what the point of it was, leading via a kind of game of telephone to the build now creating domain/data/content, something completely different from any "deployments" dir used by a scanner.
We don't precreate standalone/data/content and shouldn't need to precreate domain/data/content.
