When a managed server fails in some way, the server status reporting is inconsistent between the /host=<host>/server-config=<server> resources and the /host=<host>/server=<server> resource.
To reproduce, run domain.sh, find the pid of a server process, and kill -9 <thepid>. Then with the CLI:






[domain@localhost:9990 /] /host=master/server-config=server-two:read-attribute(name=status)




{




    "outcome" => "success",




    "result" => "FAILED"




}




[domain@localhost:9990 /] /host=master/server=server-two:read-attribute(name=server-state)




{




    "outcome" => "success",




    "result" => "STOPPED"




}
