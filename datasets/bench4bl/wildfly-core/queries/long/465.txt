Rolling back a patch applied with override on which had an instruction to add a misc content that had existed before will fail because the opposite rolling back action for ADD is assumed to be REMOVE while in this case it has to be MODIFY to rollback to the previous version of the misc content.
A similar scenario will fail for the file update task. I.e. rolling back a patch applied with override on which had an instruction to modify a non-existing misc content will fail.
