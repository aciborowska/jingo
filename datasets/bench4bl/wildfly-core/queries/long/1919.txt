Steps to Reproduce:

./standalone.sh
./jboss-cli.sh -c
/core-service=management/security-realm=ManagementRealm/authentication=local:remove
reload
<Ctrl+C>

The client is already connected, Management realm is removed, client is reloaded. 
The user is prompted for UserName (local-auth has been disabled).
Ctrl-C is typed.
During Ctrl-C handling, the client is closed although it is "reconnecting" and has kept a lock. This lock is required to close the client. Lock that will never been released.
