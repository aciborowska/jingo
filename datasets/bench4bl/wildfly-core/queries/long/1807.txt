Vault option is calling trim which is causing issues with custom vault implementation.  
The implementation of the vault config parser in the normal EAP config (i.e. in standalone.xml) does not do this.
To provide more details why this is an issue, the custom impl is prepending a string to an executable command.  By trimming the command is being mangled:
        <vault code="com.example.CommandVault" module="com.example">
            <vault-option name="prependToValue" value="perform_encryption.sh -value "/>
            <vault-option name="allowEmptyPassword" value="false"/>
        </vault>
