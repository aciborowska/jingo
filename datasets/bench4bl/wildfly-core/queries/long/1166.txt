If /some=where has a child redirection for the child=* child resource to new-child=*, then






{




    "operation" => "add",




    "address" => [




        ("some" => "where"),




        ("child" => "*")




    ]




}







gets correctly transformed to 






{




    "operation" => "add",




    "address" => [




        ("some" => "where"),




        ("new-child" => "*")




    ]




}







But if wrapped in a composite, e.g.:






{




    "operation" => "composite",




    "address" => [],




    "steps" => [




        {




            "operation" => "add",




            "address" => [




                ("some" => "where"),




                ("child" => "*")




            ]




        }




    ]




}







the redirection does not happen in the transformed composite, so we have the original






{




    "operation" => "composite",




    "address" => [],




    "steps" => [




        {




            "operation" => "add",




            "address" => [




                ("some" => "where"),




                ("child" => "*")




            ]




        }




    ]




}







rather than the expected






{




    "operation" => "composite",




    "address" => [],




    "steps" => [




        {




            "operation" => "add",




            "address" => [




                ("some" => "where"),




                ("new-child" => "*")




            ]




        }




    ]




}
