Once WFCORE-2053 is fixed, CoreResourceManagementTestCase.testCannotInvokeManagedSlaveServerOperationsInDomainComposite will fail. This test involves doing two ops in a composite, with the composite addressed to the domain root, while the steps are addressed to a subsystem on an individual server, where the server is managed by a slave HC. The first op is a read, the second is a write.
The op should fail as the write is not allowed.
Test is currently only passing because the WFCORE-2053 problem is producing false positives.
