While creating a WildFly Swarm Fraction that exposes the management console, I debugged ConsoleMode and found out that a NullPointerException is thrown in the findConsoleVersions methods. That's because the module.path returns null (as specified in the default value in this same method).
A simple null check is enough to fix it.
