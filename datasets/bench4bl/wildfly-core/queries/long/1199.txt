The problem arises because commands entered in non-interactive mode are split by the "," character.  Therefore, in the case of:
 "./bin/jboss-cli.sh -c --controller=localhost --commands="module add --name=test --resources=test.jar --dependencies=dep1,dep2"
the cli is incorrectly splitting the request into two distinct commands:
1. module add --name=test --resources=test.jar --dependencies=dep1
2. dep2
The reason this behaviour is not observed in interactive mode is because multiple commands can not be specified.  However, in non-interactive mode --commands=ls,pwd is valid and should result in the execution of ls followed by pwd.  
This problem is not restricted to the module command, as it affects all commands entered in non-interactive mode that require a comma-separated list as an argument.  So far this appears to be PatchHanlder.java, ASModuleHandler.java and DeploymentOverlayHandler.java.
