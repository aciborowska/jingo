Scenario -1

With the following line of JAVA_OPTS in "standalone.bat.conf" file






set "JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=localhost|127.0.0.1|10.10.10.*"








Error while starting WildFly






C:\wildfly-9.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT\bin>standalone.bat




Calling "C:\wildfly-9.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT\bin\standalone.conf.bat"




Setting JAVA property to "C:\JDKs\jdk1.7.0_67\bin\java"




'127.0.0.1' is not recognized as an internal or external command,




operable program or batch file.







Scenario -2

In Windows  "^" sign is the escape character so we tried altering the JAVA_OPTS as following in the "standalone.bat.conf" file:







set "JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=localhost^|127.0.0.1^|10.10.10.*"







Now WildFly server starts but still we see the following messages in windows console:






C:\wildfly-9.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT\bin>standalone.bat




Calling "C:\wildfly-9.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT\bin\standalone.conf.bat"

NOTE: It is also not possible to pass such JAVA_OPTS via command line, because it causes the same error:
