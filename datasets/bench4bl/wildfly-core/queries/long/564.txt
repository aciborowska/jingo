Jeff Mesnil 12:13 @ctomc hi tomaz. The setXmlWrapperElement() method in persistent xml builder API is supposed to add a XML wrapper around all the resource's XML elements, right? and not around each resource element.




ie it looks like <wrapper><res /><res /></wrapper> and not <wrapper><res /></wrapper><wrapper><res /></wrapper>




Tomaz Cerar 12:17 hmm, you are right also around resources




it would be <wrapper> <res /> <res/> </wrapper>




just remembered i had that in 1.0 xsd of undertow subsystem




Jeff Mesnil 12:20 yes, I want to wrap some resources (eg queue) in a wrapper (<queues>). But the persistent XM parser is broken (it wants one wrapper around each resource)




the XML persister is working as expected though




Tomaz Cerar @jmesnil you are right it is broken, i can reproduce it also on undertow-1.0.xml test case




i just had one resource under it so it passed
