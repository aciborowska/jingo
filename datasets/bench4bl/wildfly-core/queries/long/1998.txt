System property sun.net.spi.nameservice.provider.<n> allows a user to customize a NameService. It works on a standalone java, which is using JBoss Modules, if services="import" is added on sun.jdk module dependency and the sun.jdk module has the following additional dependencies.






                <path name="sun/net/spi/nameservice"/>




                <path name="sun/net/spi/nameservice/dns"/>







Though it doesn't work as a web application which has the same module path and the same dependency in jboss-deployment-structure.xml.
