Running WF from the build directory on a Windows host fails due to the clustering module.xml
    <resources>
        <artifact name="org.wildfly:wildfly-clustering-infinispan:9.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT"/>
    </resources>
in the dist directory the section is correctly resolved as
    <resources>
        <resource-root path="wildfly-clustering-infinispan-9.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT.jar"/>
    </resources>
and WF can be run from there
