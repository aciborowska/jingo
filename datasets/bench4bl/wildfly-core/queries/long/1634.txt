In CLI, when typing expression that stretches more then one line, and then deleting all characters in the last line (using backspace), cursor appears on wrong position on the previous line (should be on last column, but is on column before the last).
Further editing messes up the displayed expression, which doesn't reflect the real content of the buffer.
Reproducing:

Terminal width is 80 characters.
[] marks a cursor position.

Step 1. - I have expression spreading over two lines like this:






[standalone@embedded /] /subsystem=datasources/data-source=ExampleDS/connection-




factory[]







Step 2. - Delete "factory" word using backspace:






[standalone@embedded /] /subsystem=datasources/data-source=ExampleDS/connection-




[]







Step 3. - Another backspace:






[standalone@embedded /] /subsystem=datasources/data-source=ExampleDS/connectio[n]







while expected is:






[standalone@embedded /] /subsystem=datasources/data-source=ExampleDS/connection[]







Step 4. - Another backspace:






[standalone@embedded /] /subsystem=datasources/data-source=ExampleDS/connecti[]n







while expected is:






[standalone@embedded /] /subsystem=datasources/data-source=ExampleDS/connectio[]
