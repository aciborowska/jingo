We recently experienced a deadlock due to the logging subsystem, exactly as was detailed in this thread: https://developer.jboss.org/thread/241453
Our concern is that since we include a fairly large number of third-party components, we can't guarantee they're not using System.out or System.err somewhere, potentially causing a thread deadlock.
Are there plans to review this issue, or is the only way to guarantee not having such issues, to disable the logging subsystem?
