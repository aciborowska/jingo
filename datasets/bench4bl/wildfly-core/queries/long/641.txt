The xsd says the following for the discovery-optionType 'module' attribute:






        <xs:attribute name="module" type="xs:string" use="optional">




            <xs:annotation>




                <xs:documentation>




                    The module from which the DiscoveryOption implementation should be loaded. If not provided,




                    the DiscoveryOption implementation must be available from the Host Controller's own module.




                </xs:documentation>




            </xs:annotation>




        </xs:attribute>







But the MODULE attribute definition does not allow undefined.
But still, DiscoveryOptionAddHandler is coded as if undefined is allowed, but poorly so as it would pass an illegal null into ModuleIdentifier.fromString.
I like the behavior described in the xsd and think the AD and the handlers should be corrected.
