IgnoredResourcesProfileCloneTestCase several times reloads the slave HC without restarting its servers. But it then does not wait for those servers to reconnect before continuing on. This means the servers may not be reattached to the domain when further modifications are made.
I'm quite certain this is the cause of the failure at http://brontes.lab.eng.brq.redhat.com/viewLog.html?buildId=76866&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=WildFlyCore_PullRequest#testNameId6713698291695706313 and the other time that test failed.
IgnoredResourcesProfileCloneTestCase reloads the slave and then exits. CompositeOperationTestCase follows and immediately adds system-property=composite-op in its @Before method. The other-two server doesn't get this op as it's not reconnected. The test then later fails because the other-two server's state is not as expected.
