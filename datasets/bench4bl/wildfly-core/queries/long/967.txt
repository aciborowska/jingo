When running e.g. a series of map-add operations in a composite, only the last step takes effect. e.g.:






Model Before: {




    "deployment" => undefined,




    "subsystem" => {"test-subsystem" => {




        "properties" => {




            "one" => "A",




            "two" => "B",




            "three" => "C"




        },




        "test" => "Hello"




    }}




}




{




    "operation" => "composite",




    "address" => [],




    "steps" => [




        {




            "operation" => "map-remove",




            "address" => [("subsystem" => "test-subsystem")],




            "name" => "properties",




            "key" => "one"




        },




        {




            "operation" => "map-remove",




            "address" => [("subsystem" => "test-subsystem")],




            "name" => "properties",




            "key" => "two"




        },




        {




            "operation" => "map-remove",




            "address" => [("subsystem" => "test-subsystem")],




            "name" => "properties",




            "key" => "three"




        }




    ]




}




Model After: {




    "deployment" => undefined,




    "subsystem" => {"test-subsystem" => {




        "properties" => {




            "one" => "A",




            "two" => "B"




        },




        "test" => "Hello"




    }}




}







The same happens with map-put, map-remove, list-add and list-remove when used in a composite. I have added some more tests to https://github.com/kabir/wildfly-core/blob/map-operation-composite/controller/src/test/java/org/jboss/as/controller/operation/global/CollectionOperationsTestCase.java to demonstrate the problem. These tests should be expanded to cover more of the map operations when used in a composite.
