The logging subsystem uses a dynamic resource to list log files as resources. These are the files that are allowed to be read or downloaded and are attached to known file handlers.
When several file handlers are defined the file tree walker is invoked several times per read-resource-operation. This may be happening for each stage of an operation. Ideally we could either cache the file listing per-operation or only execute at the runtime stage. This may not be an option for dynamic resources however.
As a result of this poor performance the web console is very slow to load the logging subsystem configuration. This is not an issue with the web console.
