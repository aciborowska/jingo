When reading any JMX attribute(s), I have noticed a noticeable impact on the performance of our system. After attaching a profiler, I see that getting a single attribute of a JMX bean (either using remoting or using jconsole) is generating thousands of objects, that have to cleaned up by the GC. For instance, 6000 instances of the ModelNode class are created.
A clone is made of the complete management model before executing any JMX operation. This happens in the OperationContextImpl.readResourceFromRoot class.
