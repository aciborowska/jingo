Scanner managed deployments have the deployment resource's 'persistent' attribute set to 'false'. This results in the StandaloneXml not persisting the resource to XML, but that depends on custom logic in StandaloneXml that reads the attribute.
The Resource for these deployments should return 'true' from isRuntime() so callers can decided about this without needing internal knowledge of the resource attributes.
