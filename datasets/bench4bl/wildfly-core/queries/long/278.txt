After authentication fails in the CLI the following error message is output: -






Unable to authenticate against controller at localhost:9990: Authentication failed: the server presented no authentication mechanisms







This text is a bit misleading, what it actually means is all mechanisms presented have either been excluded or attempted and now no further mechanisms are available to try.
