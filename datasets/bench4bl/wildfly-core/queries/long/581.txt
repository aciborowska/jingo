It doesn't concern the tab-completion. But if the address is entered manually and ends on a resource type, the generated operation request will target the parent resource.
[standalone@localhost:9999 /] echo-dmr /subsystem=logging/file-handler=:remove
{

    "address" => [("subsystem" => "logging")],

    "operation" => "remove"

}
