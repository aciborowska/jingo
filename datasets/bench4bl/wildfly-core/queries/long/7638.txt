I am not able to add secure-socket-binding attribute for management-interface=http-interface resource which does not include security-realm attribute. This means that "Elytron-only" authentication and SSL configuration for HTTP interface is not possible.
Trying this issue for management-interface=native-interface is blocked by JBEAP-7424.
As workaround, if security-realm is also added then authentication with Elytron works correctly (added security-realm is not used because Elytron-related attributes in HTTP management interface have higher priority).
