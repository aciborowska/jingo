When I invoke "add-user.bat <args>", then I'm getting this Windows error message (in German):






"that" kann syntaktisch an dieser Stelle nicht verarbeitet werden.







The solution is to remove the brackets in line 34, i.e. before:






echo   WARNING: The JBOSS_HOME ("%SANITIZED_JBOSS_HOME%") that this script uses points to a different installation than the one that this script resides in ("%RESOLVED_JBOSS_HOME%"). Unpredictable results may occur.







After:






echo   WARNING: The JBOSS_HOME "%SANITIZED_JBOSS_HOME%" that this script uses points to a different installation than the one that this script resides in "%RESOLVED_JBOSS_HOME%". Unpredictable results may occur.
