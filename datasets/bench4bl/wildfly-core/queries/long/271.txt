Description of problem: The description of the 'scan-enabled' attribute states "Flag indicating that all scanning (including initial scanning at startup) should be disabled." The default value of this attribute is "true", therefore I believe the description is incorrect.
I propose that the description be changed to: "Flag indicating if all scanning (including initial scanning at startup) is enabled."
