I have a typical small domain setup: one master host controller (aka domain controller) and one slave host controller with "server-one" and "server-two" servers.
I need to discover things running in those two servers (server-one and server-two). As part of the discovery, I invoke read-resource operations via the management interface - for example, to discover all the datasources in server-one:
/host=slave/server=server-one/subsystem=datasources/data-source=*/:read-resource(include-runtime=true)
For each returned datasource, I need to know that datasource's full address. The problem is, I do not get the full address. Instead, the CLI returns the following partial address:
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => [{
        "address" => [
            ("subsystem" => "datasources"),
            ("data-source" => "ExampleDS")
        ],
        "outcome" => "success",
        "result" => 
{

            "allocation-retry" => undefined,

...and the rest of the properties for the ExampleDS datasource...

            }
        }
    }]
}
The address should be the full address of:
        "address" => [
            ("host" => "slave"),
            ("server" => "server-one"),
            ("subsystem" => "datasources"),
            ("data-source" => "ExampleDS")
        ],
NOTE! This problem occurs both when I connect to the domain controller and when I connect to the slave host controller - it doesn't matter, the CLI returns the same erroneous address if connected to either one.
