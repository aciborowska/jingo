In a domain mode :suspend-servers command with a timeout parameter different than 0 executes two suspend operations for each server in the domain. It first executes a suspend with 0ms and later a suspend with the timeout specified.
How to reproduce it:






[domain@localhost:9990 /] :suspend-servers(timeout=10)







Server log traces show:






[Server:server-one] 20:14:40,126 INFO  [org.jboss.as.server] (ServerService Thread Pool -- 8) WFLYSRV0211: Suspending server with 0ms timeout.




[Server:server-one] 20:14:40,135 INFO  [org.jboss.as.server] (ServerService Thread Pool -- 8) WFLYSRV0211: Suspending server with 10000000ms timeout.







Expected traces are:






[Server:server-one] 20:14:40,135 INFO  [org.jboss.as.server] (ServerService Thread Pool -- 8) WFLYSRV0211: Suspending server with 10000000ms timeout.
