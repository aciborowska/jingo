If a slave fails to connect to the master it logs "Could not connect to master. Aborting. Error was: %s" but since WFCORE-316 it no longer always aborts.
Plus when it does abort it uses the deprecated SystemExiter.exit method.
So we should change the first message to drop the bit about aborting and then if we do really abort pass an abort message to SystemExiter.
