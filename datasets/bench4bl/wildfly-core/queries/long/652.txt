When passing the --debug flag to the standalone.sh script, it will swallow the next argument if no port is provided. This occurs because the end of the argument processing loop performs a shift, but a debug flag with no port should not be shifted since the next argument is yet to be processed.
This can be alleviated by adding a dummy variable to the positional parameters that will be {{shift}}ed off.
