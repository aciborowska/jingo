Unclear error message after cloning non-existing profile to new profile.






[domain@localhost:9990 /] /profile=non-existing-profile:clone(to-profile=whatever)




{




    "outcome" => "failed",




    "result" => undefined,




    "server-groups" => undefined,




    "rolled-back" => true




}




[domain@localhost:9990 /] 







There should be something like this on output:
Profile 'non-existing-profile' doesn't exist.
