Don't work on this
(This is a deliberate regression of https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-3371 which will be introduced for a few hours on Tuesday 21st April 2015, so I have something to fix during a JBug demo)
When attempting to call e.g. http://localhost:9990/management/subsystem/jmx?json.pretty=1
an IllegalStateException happens. Debugging shows this to happen on the following line of DomainApiHandler






operationParameterBuilder.pretty(dmr.hasDefined("json.pretty") && dmr.get("json.pretty").asBoolean());







The dmr access needs to take into account that the parameter is not necessarily a boolen.
