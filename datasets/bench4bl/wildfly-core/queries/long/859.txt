Description of problem:
Product info report show wrong "host-cpu-arch" on amd64 architecture with 32-bit version of java (example: "Linux 32-bit x86" version of IBM JDK 8). Host-cpu-arch is probably generated by JDK version.
Steps to Reproduce:

use 32bit java on 64bit architecture of CPU
get fresh EAP from zip
./standalone.sh
./jboss-cli.sh -c
:product-info

Actual results:






        ...




        "host-cpu" => {




            "host-cpu-arch" => "x86",




            "host-core-count" => 8




        },




        ...







Expected results:
Correct value for "host-cpu-arch":






        ...




        "host-cpu" => {




            "host-cpu-arch" => "amd64",




            "host-core-count" => 8




        },




        ...







Additional info:
Architecture from product report is architecture of java (not architecture of CPU). There should be at least something like "host-cpu-arch (generated by JVM)" in product report.
