There's no access-control response header here:






[domain@localhost:9999 /] /host=master/server=server-one/subsystem=datasources/data-source=ExampleDS:read-resource{roles=Monitor}




{




    "outcome" => "success",




    "result" => {




        ....




    }




}







ProxyStepHandler needs to pass through response-header data.
