The keys for the different registrations in the CapabilityRegistry is their id, which is a combination of their name and their CapabilityScope. CapabilityRegistryResourceDefinition when it reports the registrations is ignoring the scope.
For WildFly Core 2.0.0.CR1 I'm going to disable registration of CapabilityRegistryResourceDefinition. We don't have specific management client use of this management API yet and it can still use some massaging, so committing ourselves to supporting the current API for many years isn't worth it.
