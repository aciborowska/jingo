There are extra commas in descriptions of children resources of socket-binding-group CLI resource (local-destination-outbound-socket-binding and remote-destination-outbound-socket-binding).
E.g., there is "Configuration information for a, local destination, outbound socket binding.", there should be "Configuration information for a local destination outbound socket binding."
