The service.bat batch file to install Wildfly as a WIndows Service (still) contains a small error, preventing the service being added correctly.
This bug has been reported before and also has been reported as fixed. However the bug is still there. 
WFCORE-1719
The funny thing is that the batch file even describes in a REM statement that the line "SET DESCRIPTION" should not contain quotes. So, the fix is described, but just not applied. 
Please remove the quotes in the next release.
