I noticed while testing my subsystem that sometimes using tab-complete on an attribute causes NUL ('\0') characters to be injected into the input.  These characters are invisible on the screen but cause XML marshalling to fail as that character is forbidden.
My "less" output of .jboss-cli-history looks something like this:






embed-server --std-out=echo




cd subsystem=discovery




./static-provider=test:add(services=[{uri=^@^@"local", abstract-type="ejb", abstract-type-authority="jboss"}])




./static-provider=test4:add(services=[{uri="local", abstract-type="ejb", abstract-type-authority="jboss"}])







In the first "test:add" case I used tab-completion; in the second "test4:add" case I typed it out by hand.  The "^@" are in inverse video in less, indicating a NUL character.
