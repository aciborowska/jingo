If deploy and undeploy CLI commands executed in a batch mode then it causes missing  deployment inside the "data/content" directory which leads to the following error:







[Host Controller] 10:33:42,387 ERROR [org.jboss.as.controller.management-operation] (Controller Boot Thread) WFLYCTL0013: Operation ("add") failed - address: ([("deployment" => "example.war")]) - failure description: "WFLYDC0058: No deployment content with hash d85f1e3106bc8a49838a0dccae9e80819c25e02c is available in the deployment content repository for deployment 'example.war'. This is a fatal boot error. To correct the problem, either restart with the --admin-only switch set and use the CLI to install the missing content or remove it from the configuration, or remove the deployment from the xml configuraiton file and restart."
