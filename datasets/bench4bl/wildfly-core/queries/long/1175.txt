Description of problem:
CLI prints unexpected ANSI character to output with "echo" command.

This is regression against EAP 7.0.0.DR13
This is blocker for GA release.
This is not beta blocker.
This is probably AESH issue, so I assign StÃ¥le Pedersen, but it is also CLI issue, so Alexey Loubyansky may be assigned to this

How reproducible:
Always
Steps to Reproduce:

./standalone.sh
./jboss-cli.sh --connect controller=127.0.0.1 command="echo test-echo" > out.txt
vim out.txt
	
"cat out.txt" can't be used for reproducing, because console hide unexpected ANSI characters



Actual results:






^[[0G^[[2Ktest-echo







Expected results:






test-echo
