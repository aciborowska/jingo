Firefox, Safari and IE use ISO-8859_1 character encoding when generating authentication header. If the credentials contain umlauts (eg. Ã¼), the decoded string on the server is incorrect and authentication fails.
This affects web console authentication when LDAP is used as credentials store.
Web console can solve this by using https://issues.jboss.org/browse/UNDERTOW-595 which adds ability for Undertow to use user-agent patterns to choose correct charset during BASIC authentication.
