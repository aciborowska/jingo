The 'kill' and 'destroy' operations on the HC are meant to force shutdown of misbehaving servers. But the graceful shutdown work ([1]) has introduced a management op into the mix. I believe that should be removed, as its not the intent of these operations to try and be graceful; the regular 'stop' ops are for that.
When experimenting with how domains react to OOME servers as part of my WFCORE-378 work I'm seeing 'kill' and 'destroy' no longer function because the OOME on the server means the graceful shutdown management op hangs.
