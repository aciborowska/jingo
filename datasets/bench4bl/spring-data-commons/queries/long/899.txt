I'm not sure but it seems there's a bug in ParameterizedTypeInformation.java at line 88: link github:ParameterizedTypeInformation.java.
It seems this function should return TypeInformation for a Map descendant. But if for some reason (I faced this in spring-data-mongodb) the method gets a non Map type it will return super.getMapValueType() which in turn again executes doGetMapValueType and finally we get a StackOverflowError.
Shouldn't the first if (at line 61) be spanned across whole the method to verify that we are working with Map at all?
