when populating the database using <repository:jackson-populattor /> tag, an NPE will be thrown if  the domain class which is being populated doesn't have a repository interface.
The exception message is not very clear, so I explicitly add an assert to ensure the CRUDInvoker cannot be null, and printing a more obvious error message when the assertion is failed.
