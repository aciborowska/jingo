I have a Spring MVC web application which uses PagedResourcesAssembler to introduce paging metadata. When you request the service by providing both paging and sorting parameters the next and prev links are wrong - they duplicate the sorting parameter.
When I investigated the issue I found that in HateoasSortHandlerMethodArgumentResolver the query parameters are built with builder.queryParam(…) instead of builder.replaceQueryParam(…).
