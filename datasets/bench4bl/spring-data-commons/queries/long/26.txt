The detection mechanism for the persistence constructor does not seem to detect private constructors. Given the following class:






public class Foo {




 




  public static final Foo ONE = new Foo(1);




  public static final Foo TWO = new Foo(2);




 




  private int value;




  




  private Foo(int value); { ... }




}






Same applies to package protected constructors. Of course one would better use an enum for that currently but one might need this construct here to get Mongo's $gt and $lt to work correctly.
