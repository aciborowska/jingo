It's possible to return a Map<Key, Value> inside a custom repository using @Query. The problem is that for no results the Map is null instead of empty. In my interpretation if the underlying ResultList is empty then the map is of course null, but could be initiated to empty. Also Optional<Map<Key, Value>> throws an IllegalStateException.
