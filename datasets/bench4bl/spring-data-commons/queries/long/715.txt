public interface RepositoryExample extends JpaRepository<User, String>{




	




        // This Query's timeout just works 




	@Query("FROM User")




	@Transactional(timeout = 10,propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)




	public List<User> findAll2();




	




        //The query below - timeout doesn't work , the @Transactional timeout is not being applied




        // Although in the documentation it shows it suppose to work exactly as below 




        @Override	




	@Transactional(timeout = 10,propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)




	public List<User> findAll();




}






Recommendation: In order to debug it put breakpoint in  EntityManagerFactoryUtils.applyTransactionTimeout
