In SortHandlerMethodArgumentResolver (added in 1.6), you can customize the request parameter name with method setSortParameter. However, PageableHandlerMethodArgumentResolver uses the word "property" instead of "paramater" for its request parameter properties: setPageProperty and setSizeProperty. These should be consistent. I prefer "parameter" because that reflects the fact that it's a request parameter, but however they're named it should be consistent.
