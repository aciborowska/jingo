The use of ReactiveWrappers methods such as supports or isSingleValueType loads Spring's ReactiveAdapter.Descriptor of which ReactiveAdapter references Project Reactor and Reactive Streams types. This can easily lead to unwanted runtime dependencies that are not needed. 
ReactiveWrappers should be safe to use without any reactive library dependency.
