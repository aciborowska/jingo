Hi,
the reason for this issue is similar/related to the one described in DATACMNS-648:
PreferredConstructorDiscoverer creates a static DefaultParameterNameDiscoverer, wich adds a LocalVariableTableParameterNameDiscoverer to parameterNameDiscoverers. This LVTPND holds a Map with a class as a key.
As I said, I'm using a custom classloaders for a kind of plugin-based application.
The problem is, since entity-classes stay in the LVTPND's parameterNamesCache, the custom classloader who loaded the entity class can never be GC'ed.
Also note that MethodParameters could potentially cause the same problems because of the static DefaultParameterNameDiscoverer
Regards
Matthias
