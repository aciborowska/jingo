The current order makes the persistent entity creation fail in strict mode even if the requested type is one that is filtered out in shouldCreatePersistentEntity() (e.g. simple java types, collections etc).
I want to make the mapping context strict in Spring Data Neo4j as for correct index creation the entities have to be known upfront and so base-package for <neo4j:config/> is mandatory now. The strict mode should enforce this.
