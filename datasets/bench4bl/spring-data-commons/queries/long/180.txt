AbstractPersistentProperty treats plain transient fields as transient an thus those fields will not end up being persisted which is probably not in line with what one wants to achieve by making the field transient.
Although the Java specification says transient expresses a property shall not be serialized we actually have to as they are usually reconstituated in a readObject(â€¦) method we cannot call and thus would not recreate the object in a state it was before persisting.
