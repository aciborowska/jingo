If a superclass contains a property field which is shadowed in the subclass (and might have different attributes type, annotations etc), both properties are added to the properties set:
It should instead:

have a correct equals / hashCode in AbstractPersistentProperty based on the name
check for already existing properties with that name in the set (probably change to map) and throw an MappingException
