I just upgraded my Spring Data JPA project from version 1.3.4 to 1.4.0 and I've found that the new Data Commons 1.6 breaks on a repository method that I have named findByOrganizationAndUserIdNot. The problem is that the Organization part is incorrectly parsed as OR ganization.
The former version didn't have this problem: as 'ganization' starts with a lower-cased g in my method name I'd expect Spring Data to keep the full property name intact.
This happens in org.springframework.data.repository.query.parser.PartTree.Predicate.buildTree(String, Class<?>), I haven't checked what changed compared to the older code.
