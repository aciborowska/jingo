AbstractPersistentProperties.isEntity() returns false for properties being collection like or maps. This will cause the MappingContext not parsing the nested types when the owning type is added to the context.
This usually is not a problem as the clients will explicitly request PersistentEntity instances for the type of these properties later on and thus transparently add them later on. However, components that do a defensive hasPersistentEntityFor(â€¦) to prevent accidental creation will never be able to see persistence metadata for those types.
