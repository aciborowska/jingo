This problem happens in PageableArgumentResolver 
The default has is really 3+1 because of these lines in getDefaultFromAnnotationOrFallback:
// +1 is because we substract 1 later
return new PageRequest(defaults.pageNumber() + 1, defaults.value());
This +1/-1 stuff is making using this code very confusing.
page.page=1 will return the same results at page.page=0.
