Parameters creates a static DefaultParameterNameDiscoverer, wich adds a LocalVariableTableParameterNameDiscoverer to its list of ParameterNameDiscoverers.
This LVTPND holds a Map with a class as a key.
As I said, I'm using a custom classloaders for a kind of plugin-based application.
The problem is, since Repository-subclasses stay in the LVTPND's parameterNamesCache, the custom classloader who loaded the Repository can never be GC'ed.
Im not sure about if this issue should be fixed in Spring Data Commons or in LocalVariableTableParameterNameDiscoverer by using a WeakHashMap for parameterNamesCache.
