Twitter has deprecated their /trends/current endpoint and now returns an HTTP 410 when calling that endpoint. SearchOperations.getCurrentTrends() should be removed.
Note that Twitter says that this endpoint was deprecated in favor of the /trends/:woeid endpoint. Therefore apps using getCurrentTrends() should now use getLocalTrends() instead.
