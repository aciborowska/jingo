Tweet objects returned by SearhTemplate.search(...) methods never have languageCode populated. Looking at TweetDeserializer I see 
JsonNode languageCodeNode = tree.get("iso_language_code");
which looks for iso_language_code in the main section and not under "metadata" as stated by API 1.1 (see an example here https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/search/tweets)
