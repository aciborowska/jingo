The 1.0.4.RELEASE build for Spring Social Twitter included support for application tokens using OAuth 2 client credentials grant. The implementation of that doesn't go through the normal code path for obtaining an OAuth2-authorized RestTemplate (e.g., it didn't obtain its application-authorized RestTemplate via ProtectedResourceClientFactory). Consequently, CNFE would be thrown when used with Spring Framework 3.0.x due to the fact that ClientHttpRequestInterceptor wasn't introduced until Spring 3.1.x.
When constructed with an application token, TwitterTemplate should consider whether or not Spring 3.1 is available and, if not, fall back on using Spring30OAuth2RequestFactory.
