I'm using the Hex codec to decode e.g. the string "qq". What surprises 
me is that this obviously illegal hex value is decoded into one byte 
value 255. In fact all non-hex 'character-pairs' are decoded to value 255.
Wouldn't it be better to throw a DecoderException if illegal characters 
are passed in?
The current implementation decodes values that is is actually not able 
to decode, which is wrong.
Cheers,
Tom
