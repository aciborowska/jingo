The source code for SoundexTest has this:
    // This test fails.
    public void testUsEnglishStatic()
    {
        assertEquals( Soundex.US_ENGLISH.soundex( "Williams" ), "W452" );
    }

However the test doesn't seem to fail.
It's followed by:
    // This test succeeds.
    public void testNewInstance()
    {
        assertEquals( new Soundex().soundex( "Williams" ), "W452" );
    }
