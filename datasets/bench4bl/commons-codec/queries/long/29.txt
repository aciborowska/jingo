Calling Soundex.setMaxLength() with a value of 2 or less causes the wrong answer
to be returned. Since the encoding returned by Soundex is /always/ of length 4
by definition (we do not use the '-' in as a letter-nnn separator for some
reason) the need for a maxLength attribute is not needed (I claim). Deprecate
the field and accessor methods.
