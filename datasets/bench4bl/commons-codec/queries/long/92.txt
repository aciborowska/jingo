Many test cases use getBytes() or new .String(byte[] bytes).
These both use the default platform encoding so the tests may fail on some platforms.
The tests should either use a known encoding (e.g. UTF-8) or should use bytes directly (e.g. 'h','e','l','l','o' instead of "hello".getBytes())
There don't seem to be any examples of such method calls in the main code, so the priority has been set to minor.
