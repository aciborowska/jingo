The source distribution for commons-codec-1.3/build.xml file has a "dist" and "jar" targets that refer to ../LICENSE which does not exist.  Therefore, an "ant dist" build fails at the "copy" tasks that refer to this missing file one directory back from the unpacked "commons-codec-1.3" directory, such as:
BUILD FAILED
C:\Apps\Libraries\Java\commons-codec-1.3\build.xml:93: Warning: Could not find file C:\Apps\Libraries\Java\LICENSE to copy.
Please (1) include the LICENSE file itself in "commons-codec-1.3" directory, and then (2) fix lines 93 and 100 of build.xml to refer to "LICENSE" and not "../LICENSE".
