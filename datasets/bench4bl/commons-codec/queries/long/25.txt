It looks like there are some changes made to the URLCodec class(rev 1.7 and 1.8)
that do not seem quite right (in my opinion). 
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-commons/codec/src/java/org/apache/commons/codec/net/URLCodec.java?r1=1.7&r2=1.9
The ENCODING variable in my original patch was made final static for a good
reason. It is not supposed to be anything but US-ASCII. After all, the whole
point of URL encoding is to represent non-ASCII data using a limited set of
ASCII characters only, hence, 'US-ASCII' as a final static variable ENCODING.
With the present code, if US-ASCII incompatible encoding is used (such as
UTF-16, EBCDIC), URLCodec may produce erroneous results. I understand that the
intention of the revision 1.7 & 1.8 was to allow for user defined default
encoding, but in its present form URLCodec does not seem to produce the desired
results.
The patch I am about to attach should take care of the problem while retaining
the existing (intended) semantics of the URLCodec class.
