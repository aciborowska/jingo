This patch deprecates URLCodec#getEncoding method and replaces it with
URLCodec#getCharSet method, because the term encoding is used in RFC1522 to
refer to the encoding/decoding algorithm, whereas charset is used to refer to
the character set associated with the unencoded text. 
Let me know if you agree/disagree
