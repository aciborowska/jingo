The following test passes in commons-codec 1.3 but fails in 1.4:



public void testObjectEncode() throws Exception {

    Base64 b64 = new Base64();

    assertEquals("SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=", new String(b64.encode("Hello World".getBytes())));

}



Commons-codec 1.3 returns "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=".
Commons-codec 1.4 returns "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=\r\n".
I'd understand if you want to close this as "Won't Fix", since the behaviour wasn't documented before (the constructor wasn't even present!) and now it is. 
However, there is still no test for this behaviour on trunk as far as I can tell, so it would be good to add one so it doesn't change again in the future. I'll attach a patch for Base64Test which you can apply on trunk which will do so.
