The website is for version 1.6.
There is a link entitled "Javadoc (1.5 release)" which actually links to the Javadoc for 1.4.
Not sure why there should be a link for the previous version Javadoc at all, but given that there is, it ought to be be correct.
I would favour dropping the Javadoc link for the next release; the current Javadoc is available under the reports section.
However, this does assume that the site is built and deployed from the release tag.
