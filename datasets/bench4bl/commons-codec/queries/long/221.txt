The HmacUtils.updateHmac() methods call reset().
This means that it's not possible to build up a digest using multiple such calls.
The only useful operation that can be performed afterwards is to call one of the Mac.doFinal() methods.
Unfortunately it's probably too late to change this.
However it should at least be documented.
