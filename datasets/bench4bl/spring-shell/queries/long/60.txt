When trying to run the helloworld spring-shell sample under Cygwin, I see the shell start up and give me a prompt, but once I type something and hit Enter it appears to hang. (Also there is no colorization).
The problem is in how the particular jline terminal gets chosen. If the platform is detected as Windows then Jansi is automatically activated and a WindowsTerminal is created. In addition, under Windows, jline.terminal is not honored.
The attached patch honors jline.terminal which then lets me set the terminal to jline.UnixTerminal which results in the shell working as expected.
