When we use spring shell in serengeti, we noticed that if users input a option name without big letters, spring shell will ignore this option rather throw some error messages. One example is here:
cluster create --name test --specfile /jun/1.json
The correct usage is cluster create --name test --specFile /jun/1.json
But spring shell just ignore --specfile without throwing any error messages. This will make users confused as it seems --specfile does not work, and they ususally do not aware the reason is --specFile.
