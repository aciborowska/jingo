Typical example:
rm --recursive --dir /foo ==> fails (thinks --dir is the value to --recursive)
rm --dir /foo --recursive ==> OK
Possible fixes include:

always consider -xx to be keys, UNLESS some criteria (eg "-xx" with quotes is the user explicitly wanting a value with --)
more complicated, given the tokenizing phase happens before the parsing phase, which knows about default values: don't treat --foo as a value if the previous key may have a default
