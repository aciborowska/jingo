If a command is entered, followed by a space, optionally followed by other characters, and tab is pressed, then autocomplete will fail if the command entered is a prefix of another command.
e.g commands = "foo", "fooBar"
if "foo [anything]" is entered followed by tab, then " [anything]" will be removed from buffer and "foo", "fooBar" will be presented as candidate completions.
I've issued a PR which fixes this.
