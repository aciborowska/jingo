Hello,
We are from VMWare Big Data Extensions group. We have been using Spring Shell 1.0 as our CLI. Now we need to support i18n. After we have a basic try of input/output Chinese to Spring Shell under Windows Chinese 2008, Spring Shell always show ?? for these Chinese characters. 
I remembered in some cases Spring Shell itself can show Chinese output messages, maybe we need to configure somehow in order to support input/output Chinese?
Many Thanks for any idea here.
