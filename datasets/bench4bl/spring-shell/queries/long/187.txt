Attempt to compile results in numerous errors of the following form:






X:\git\spring-shell\src\main\java\org\springframework\shell\table\BorderStyle.java:43: error: unmappable character for encoding Cp1252




        fancy_heavy('┃', '▒?'),




                              ^




...







After fixing this, ran into test failures:






:test




 




org.springframework.shell.table.BorderFactoryTest > testFullBorder FAILED




    java.lang.AssertionError at BorderFactoryTest.java:47




...







Both of these are result of presence of Unicode characters that are not supported by Windows' default encoding (CP1252).
