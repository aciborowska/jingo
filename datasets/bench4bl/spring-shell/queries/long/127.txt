Hi Eric,
We found it strange when we input directory or file name that includes high-ascii characters of French/German under spring shell on Windows 7. It seems even we set the correct locale on Windows, these names will be transformed to some strange encoded names. For example, when we input "c:\äöÄÖ", our java codes will pass this string to FileInputStream, which cannot recognize this name on the file system. We found in JLineShell.java->line 335, spring shell wrap jline's consolereader with ansi console, and seems if we use consolereader directly, these high-ascii characters can be recognized correctly. 
Do you have any ideas about what is the encoding set for these high-ascii characters on Windows after wrapping ansiconsole?
Thanks,
Jun
