If the key of a @CliOption contains a "-", the shell cannot deal with that.
Example:






@CliCommand(value = "mycommand")




	public String command(




@CliOption(key = "ssh-user") final String sshUser) {




   ...




}






Actual result:

Execution of "mycommand --ssh-user root" leads to error "Option 'user'" is not available for this command"
Hitting tab after typing "mycommand --ssh-" does not properly complete this argument name to "mycommand --ssh-user "

Expected result:
Shell should be able to properly accept these argument keys.
