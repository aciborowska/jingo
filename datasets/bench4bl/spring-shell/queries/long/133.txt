the command line args are being parsed, which isn't needed in this case, but it fails based on the logic behind this test
	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
	public void testTwoOptionsSameEmptyKey() 
{
		tokenize("bar buzz");
	}

not allowing two options to have an empty key.  What is the rationale?
