 * Special exception for listener implementations that want to signal that the current batch of messages should be




 * acknowledged immediately (i.e. as soon as possible) without rollback, and without consuming any more messages.







This is not strictly true.
If an error handler throws the exception, it will work as described; if the listener throws it, it is wrapped in a ListenerExecutionFailedException which is re-thrown.






try {




	executeListener(channel, message);




}




catch (ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException e) {




	break;




}




catch (Throwable ex) { //NOSONAR




	consumer.rollbackOnExceptionIfNecessary(ex);




	throw ex;




}







Either don't wrap the exception (in the container and listener adapter), or add another catch block.
Also, clarify the javadoc...

and without consuming any more messages.
...only applies to the current txSize - processing doesn't stop completely.
