If the queue name for rabbit direct-exchange binding contains a dot character, the default routing key evaluation will fail on non-existing bean <string_before_first_dot>, which unfortunately breaks all our direct-exchange bindings with such queue names.
Following configuration fails on unresolvable bean 'communication'.






<rabbit:direct-exchange name="communication.mail">




  <rabbit:bindings>




    <rabbit:binding queue="communication.mail" />




  </rabbit:bindings>




</rabbit:direct-exchange>






What was the reason behind using SPEL expression as default routing key in DirectExchangeParser?
It would be ok if it's used with explicitly set key to take advantage of spel evaluation to provide flexible routing keys, but as a default, it's somehow undocumented hidden breaking magic.
