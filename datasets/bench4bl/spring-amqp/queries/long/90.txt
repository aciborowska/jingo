After starting up my application a uncaught runtime error occurs (NPE, etc...) If the exception is caught by the SimpleMessageListener class, it invokes shutdown on the rabbit listener. However, it leaves the channel open. This ties up needless resources on the boxes. Also, it gives no output that an exception has occured (doesn't log the error, etc...) and doesn't provide output above a debug level that it's going to stop the listener. 
Would be nice if the fact that shutdown was called was more obvious (logged at info or warn level) and that the channel was closed. Both would be a better indication to the developer/admin that something had occured and needed to be investiaged.
