If the container is stopping, it throws a MessageRejectedWhileStoppingException.
The logic added by AMQP-221 to support Dead Letter Exchange/Queue is indiscriminate and, if the container is configured to always reject failed messages, rejects messages, even for this exception.
We should always requeue messages that fail to process because the container is stopping.
