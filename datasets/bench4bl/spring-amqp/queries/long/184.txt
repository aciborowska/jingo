The forum thread describes the issue pretty well.  In a nutshell, the reply-to value provided for rpc server response should simply be the name of a queue, not something that needs parsing.  RabbitMQ's amqp_rpc_server Erlang module https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-erlang-client/blob/master/src/amqp_rpc_server.erl takes the reply-to value at face value and so does com.rabbitmq.client.RpcServer https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/blob/master/src/com/rabbitmq/client/RpcServer.java.
