NoSuchMethodException is treated as container-fatal - this might be a transient condition.
Let's say we have
handleMessage(Foo foo)
and
handleMessage(Bar bar
on the listener and someone sends a Baz.
Today, we stop the container (line 1350 in SMLC - AMQP-351).
Instead, we should move this exception to the DefaultExceptionStrategy in the ConditionalRejectingErrorHandler so that NoSuchMethodException is message-fatal, not container-fatal.
