When using the AmqpAppender we always get the following message on stderr -






[ERROR] Apr 21, 2015 7:04:53 PM org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.connection.CachingConnectionFactory createBareConnection




[ERROR] INFO: Created new connection: SimpleConnection@3ce1e309 [delegate=amqp://guest@127.0.0.1:5672/]






This is when running an application from SBT, so logs to stderr are reported as errors.
Also, the AmqpAppender seems to attempt to connect to RabbitMQ regardless of whether it is currently used by a logger.  Ideally, this should only happen when actually using the AmqpAppender to avoid unnecessary RabbitMQ connection attempts.  Feel free to break this out into a separate issue if need be.
