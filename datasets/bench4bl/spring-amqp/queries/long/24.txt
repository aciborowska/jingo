We should set the hostname directly on the target ConnectionFactory rather than storing it in an instance variable (it is currently never being used!).
Also, we should replace the constructor that takes both targetConnectionFactory and hostname so that it only takes the targetConnectionFactory. That target should already have its hostname set anyways.
Finally, the getHostName() method can simply return the targetConnectionFactory.getHost() value.
