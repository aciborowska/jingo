The documentation for the 'key' attribute of the <binding> element claims that the queue name will be used as a default (if no 'key' attribute is provided). However, that does not actually happen. Instead if there is no key, the value is empty. It just so happens that for the default no-name exchange a queue name is automatically bound, but there's no reason for using the <binding> element to bind to the no-name exchange in the first place.
The documentation should probably just be shortened (unless we decide the default behavior it claims does make sense - in which case this bug is not just about documentation but about implementing that functionality). For now, if no 'key' is provided, then no binding key is used... for fanout exchanges that works (for a topic exchange, even '#' might be a reasonable default).
