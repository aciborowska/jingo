I'm not sure it's really a problem, but Tomcat should wait for the context to close, so why do I keep seeing ShutdownSignalExceptions?  If you start Tomcat in debug mode from WTP and then shut it down, you can see the exception because the debugger pauses.  Unfortunately it happens quite frequently but not always, so the first task is to get an integration test that mimics this scenario (not sure why the existing *LifecycleIntegrationTests don't expose it).
