In LatchCountDownAndCallRealMethodAnswer the coundown latch is decremented before the original handler method is invoked, which can lead to a test terminating prematurely. In the test waiting for the latch to countdown, asserts can be fired off before the handler methods have fully completed. This can even lead to messages staying in queues if tests terminate quickly enough.
