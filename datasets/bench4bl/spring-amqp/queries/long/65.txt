Make RabbitAdmin.deleteQueue() return boolean: currently it fails if the queue didn't exist, but it would be nicer really to simply ignore the exception and return false.  It would save us having to do this everywhere:






try {




	admin.deleteQueue("test.queue");




} catch (AmqpIOException e) {




	// Ignore (queue didn't exist)




}
