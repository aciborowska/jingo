We are using an older version of Spring AMQP so perhaps this is irrelevant but it appears that you can not RPC (sendAndReceive) with the same connection factory using direct reply-to (I backported AMQP-448 using template.execute(...)) . If you do it will sporadically fail and drop messages.
That is it appears you cannot send a message with direct reply-to and then respond to that message with the same connection factory (because it will reuse the same connection).
Some may not have seen this as this requires sending large volumes of messages to the same machine which is probably not the case in production (ie request reply to yourself is not a common use case).
I'm somewhat sure this is applicable with the latest version (I can't test yet but looking at the code it appears so).  I'm not sure if this is an inherent bug/limitation with the rabbitmq client connections or if its in spring amqp's connection factory.
I couldn't decide where to post this as this probably not a bug but perhaps should be included in the documentation or maybe I'm just wrong?
