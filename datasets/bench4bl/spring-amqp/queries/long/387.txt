 Prior to 1.3.0 it was possible to create a RabbitTemplate without needing org.springframework.retry and because of this, and I assume other reasons, org.springframework.retry was listed as an optional dependency in Spring AMQP's POM file. However with the new RetryTemplate that can be used with the RabbitTemplate causes compilation issues when updating to the latest Spring AMQP, even if you don't intend to use the retry logic. Since the RabbitTemplate is a fundamental feature of Spring AMQP and can't be constructed without org.springframework.retry it seems odd that org.springframework.retry is still an optional dependency.
