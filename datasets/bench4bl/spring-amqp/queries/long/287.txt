 The issue is caused by missing machines (no machine at at the target IP/crashed server) or network/firewall issues causing connectivity issues, specifically dropped packets.
It should be noted that windows vs linux behave differently on the missing server case - windows apparently gives some response that the container is happier with and it will go into the retry cycle. On linux missing server or any other cause of dropped packets will cause the below error. This can be simulated easily on a linux machine with
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --destination-port 5672 -j DROP
(adjusting port as necessary)
