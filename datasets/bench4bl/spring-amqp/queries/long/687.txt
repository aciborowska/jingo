If config is made this way:






<int-amqp:inbound-channel-adapter channel="input-channel" queue-names="probni" message-converter="jsonMessageConverter"




                                  channel-transacted="true"




                                  transaction-manager="dataSourceTransactionManager"




                                  transaction-attribute="transactionAttribute" />







transactionAttribute which is RuleBasedTransactionAttribute is not considered at all and dataSourceTransactionManager is always rollbacked even if I have no-rollback-for set correctly.
