Within a direct-exchange declaration in XML I have a binding element: its key attribute's XSD doc reads "...If not provided defaults to the queue name". However, the DirectExchangeParser sets it to an empty string if it's not specified. Defaulting to the queue name actually sounds like a sensible default, so maybe the implementation should be made to match the documentation.
