I periodically request status information from a service through a named outbound channel and an automatically created temporary inbound channel. Often the request gets handled properly, but sometimes it seems the response does not get received either because it got lost or the service not sending it at all. When that happens in Spring-JMS with an analogous configuration, the temporary channel times out with the default timeout of 5000ms and an Exception gets logged in the ExceptionListener (JMS). Then my client retries the status request and succeeds in receiving it. With Spring-AMQP it seems the default timeout of 5000ms is not working for temporary response channels. Thus the client waits on some read-method endlessly and halts completely. I don't see any exception bein logged and can't do anything, but restart the process. This smells like the temporary response channel has a infinite timeout despite the default settings being configured in RabbitTemplate is:






private static final long DEFAULT_REPLY_TIMEOUT = 5000;
