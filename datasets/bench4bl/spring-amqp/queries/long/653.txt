When using RabbitTemplate in a Spring Boot application, it's very easy to register a Spring AMQP Message Converter. Just add this to your code:






@Bean




Jackson2JsonMessageConverter jackson2JsonMessageConverter() {




	return new Jackson2JsonMessageConverter();




}







However, if you switch to RabbitMessagingTemplate, that bean no longer works, because RabbitMessagingTemplate doesn't offer to look up RabbitTemplate's converters, and instead relies on its own. Looking inside Spring Boot, there doesn't appear to be any wiring that offers to hook up message converters either.
