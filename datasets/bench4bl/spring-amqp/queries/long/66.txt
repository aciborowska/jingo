If you try to declare a Queue in a vHost that you don't have permission for you get a nasty EOFException (wrapped in a stack of equally uninformative IO and AMQP exceptions).
If you see this for your vhost:






rabbitmqctl.bat -p dave list_permissions




Listing permissions in vhost "dave" ...




...done.






this is going to lead to problems.  You can always fix it by using "rabbitctl set_permissions ..." but the exception you get from Java in the meantime is obscure.
