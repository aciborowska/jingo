Reference in this point
http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/1.4.1.RELEASE/reference/html/jpa.repositories.html#jpa.modifying-queries
suggests that @Modifying.clearAutomatically() is true by default, and that entity manager is cleared after method execution. Javadoc says that default value is false:
http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/1.4.1.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/data/jpa/repository/Modifying.html#clearAutomatically%28%29
I checked that javadoc is right, flag is false by default and entity manager is not cleared. I think that it would be better to change this according to reference, because it's bad situation when em can have outdated entities by default. It should be deliberate decision not to clear em after modifying query.
Anyway there is inconsistence between reference and javadoc.
