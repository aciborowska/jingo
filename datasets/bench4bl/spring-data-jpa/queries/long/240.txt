I have a maven build that depends on Spring Data 1.1.0.RELEASE and I noticed that snapshot dependencies for Spring 3.2 were regularly being downloaded.  I think that this is due to Maven not handling version ranges correctly.
Could you consider updating your pom[1] to depend on a specific version rather than a range.
