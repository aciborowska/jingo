Since 1.6.4.RELEASE, maps of type Map<String, Entity> no longer work. I have prepared a test project that demonstrates the problem. The problem does not occur with 1.6.2.RELEASE (and below).
It might be related to changes in Spring Data Commons, especially this commit:
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/commit/fa41724bfe8b7f36978aa1e5df6b789a66d93921?diff=unified
But I'm not sure about that.
