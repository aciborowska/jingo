Documentation for JpaSpecificationExecutor talks about







List<T> readAll(Specification<T> spec);






when it should be






List<T> findAll(Specification<T> spec);






The same is true in various other places in the documentation - I presume a find/replace for readAll/findAll is needed?

Query keywords table has a typo of "ngWith" instead of "EndingWith"
Query keywords table appears to have StartingWith / EndingWith the wrong way around (StartingWith claims " (parameter bound with prepended %)" which would be wrong?)


Section 1.5.1 (Domain class web binding for Spring MVC) code excerpts don't seem to make much sense to me? Specifically:
	
they're presuambly missing key steps - I don't believe that loading a User and then returning a String is going to have the User be populated into the resulting Model? I see that other examples call model.addAttribute, so why not do it here for consistency and to be clear.
They contain incorrect pieces of code:






    int page = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("page"));




    int pageSize = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("pageSize"));




    model.addAttribute("users", userService.getUsers(pageable));






where in this case, the pageable parameter is never declared (though I completely get what the example is trying to show, but only from the code excerpt that follows it)


Appendix C.1.1 contains a shortened class name which prevents copy-paste (which I would have liked since it's a debugging aid):






execution(public * org.sfw.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository+.*(..))
