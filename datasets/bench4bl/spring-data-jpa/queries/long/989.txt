Getting a Stream from CrudRepository can lead - at least on H2 - to breaking streams leading to this error:
The object is already closed [90007-192]
org.hibernate.exception.GenericJDBCException: could not advance using next()
This error seem to happen randomly on long running streams.
I created an application which always fails because of that error. As the times differ extremely, my tests failed after reading 11250 entries, 250 entries, 6000, 1000, 4250, 7750, 3750, 1000, 5250, 12500, 5000 or 2750 entries.
The full stacktrace is attached.
