I have UserRepository with overriden crud repo methods::






@Repository




@RepositoryRestResource(path = "user")




public interface UserRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository<User, Long> {




 




    @Override




    @EntityGraph(attributePaths = {"permissionGroups.module"})




    @RestResource




    User findOne(@Param("id") Long id);




 




    @Override




    @EntityGraph(attributePaths = "organization")




    @RestResource




    Page<User> findAll(Pageable pageable);




}







The first call to one of these methods is proceeded properly - specified graph is applied. But then, if i call the other one, the same entity graph will be apllied (not the specified one for this method).
For example, if i call findOne(id) first, i will get user with permissionGroups collection fetched. But then, if i call findAll(), i will get users not with organization fetched, but with permissionGroups. The reverse order of mehod's calls is also has this problem (i will get users with organizations, but not the user with permissionGroups)
