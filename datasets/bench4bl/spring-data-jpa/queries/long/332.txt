e.g. see https://github.com/fommil/zibaldone/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/fommil/zibaldone/control/BunchController.java#L44
in the getBunches method. If an empty list of ids is passed to findAll, then an exception (which seems to be specific to the underlying database) is thrown due to a grammar problem.
The expected behaviour should be to return instantly with an empty list.
A workaround is to do what I have done in the above snippet, and manually check for empty parameters.
