"spring-jpa-1.2.xsd" and "spring-jpa-1.3.xsd" reference "spring-repository.xsd" (i.e. without version number) but this file doesn't exist on the server.
See on http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/repository/
In addition, there exists no "spring-jpa.xsd" file either, whereas it seems the norm for Spring components (e.g. "spring-beans.xsd", "spring-aop.xsd", etc).
On the same subject, in the past: DATAJPA-21, DATAJPA-24.
