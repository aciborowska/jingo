I have problems installing spring-data-jpa (1.5.0, also 1.5.1) in an OSGi environment. It seems to me that spring-data-jpa's bundle MANIFEST.MF is wrong wrt joda-time (it says in the Import section to import org.joda.time;version="[1.5.0,2.0.0)". However the dependency spring-data-commons (1.7.0 resp. 1.7.1) imports (and uses) org.joda.time;version="[2.3.0,3.0.0)". In conclusion OSGi has problems building a consistent class space.
As I can see from spring-data-jpa's pom it is referencing spring-data-parent which in turn defines jodatime to be 2.3.0. I have no idea why now spring-data-jpa's MANIFEST.MF is not stating [2.3.0,3.0.0] as it is the case for spring-data-common. So it seems to me that this is a build bug.
Note: I've just updated the spring-data-jpa (1.5.1 version) MANIFEST.MF manually to import org.joda.time;version="[2.3.0,3.0.0)". When using that jar it deploys correctly under OSGi in Apache Karaf.
