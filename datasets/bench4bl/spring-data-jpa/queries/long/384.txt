This may or may not be in the right project. I think it is, but it may need to be moved to Spring Data Commons.
Spring Data JPA offers Java-based configuration with @EnableJpaRepositories. However, there is no replacement for the <auditing> XML namespace element. I believe Spring Data / Spring Data JPA will detect a AuditorAware bean and use it automatically, but that doesn't solve the set-date and modify-on-creation problem. (Note: I'm all for omitting a date-time-provider-ref replacement, since it is obsolete. It only works with Joda Time.)
Spring Data JPA should offer an annotation for configuring auditing as well.
