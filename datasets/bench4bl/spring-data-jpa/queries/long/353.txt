Using the postprocessor to scan the classpath for mapping orm.xml files using a wildcard pattern. Although the mapping files are discovered, they are added to the PersistenceUnitInfo as URLs. As a result they cannot be resolved by hibernate because it expects them in qualified package resource form:






INFO  org.hibernate.ejb.Ejb3Configuration - HHH000360: Unable to resolve mapping file [file:/Users/dev/Documents/eclipse-workspaces/workspace/project1/target/classes/com/example/model/Mapping.orm.xml]
