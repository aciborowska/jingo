We have working code with normal Spring 4.1.6.RELEASE. I've spent some time converting the project to use Spring Boot, which I really want to use, but Spring Boot has somehow broken the documented behaviour described here: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.custom-behaviour-for-all-repositories. The custom methods used on our repository base class are now getting reported as "property not found on entity <T>.
I've struggled all day to try to find a way around this, but have come up empty handed. Because the main property affected is a secondary id property (the entity ids are longs and the secondary id is a string) I figured I can use AttributeConverter on the entity base class to convert the @Id column from string to long, but alas, this doesn't work either because this mechanism doesn't support @Id columns. Very frustrating because that would have been immensely useful.
So, now I don't know how to get around this. I appreciate this bug may take time fix, so if anyone can tell me how to re-implement the custom methods in the meantime, I'd appreciate it.
