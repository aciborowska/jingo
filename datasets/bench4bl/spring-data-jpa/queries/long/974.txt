I have model entity as below
Document <-1-----M--> Document
and repository method is "public List<DocumentWithoutParent> findByParentIsNull()"
where 'DocumentWithoutParent' is projection
sql that hibernate generate is incorrect. but when I change List<DocumentWithoutParent> to List<Document> it is OK.
So I think problem come from spring data jpa.
Below is  a test project on this problem.
