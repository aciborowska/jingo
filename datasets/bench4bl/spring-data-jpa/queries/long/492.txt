I am developping a web application which uses Spring and JPA. My aim is to get the content of a table called Product with a filter on the table identifier (use of the SQL syntax 'IN'). For that, I use the method findAll(Iterable<ID>) of an interface which extends of CrudRepository.
On the call of the method findAll, I catch an exception which tell me that Spring can't compare an Integer object to an Iterable object. But, I don't understand why Spring try to compare an Integer object to an Iterable object.
Please find in attachment a simple project which reproduces the exception
The URL of the exception: http://localhost:8080/myshop/product/list
