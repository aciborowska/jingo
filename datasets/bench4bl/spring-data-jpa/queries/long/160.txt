I have included a forum link here http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?118643-xsd-validation-errors-in-Eclipse-when-using-spring-data by someone else apparently having the same issue as I am.  My configuration is even simpler than the one described in the forum thread I have posted it in its entirety below:






<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>




<beans:beans xmlns= "http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/jpa" 




	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

</beans:beans>






Basically STS is showing the annoying red X saying that 'A schema cannot contain two global components with the same name; this schema contains two occurrences of 'http://www.springframework.org/schema/
{context, beans tool}
,xxx'  Where xxx can be replaced by one of the many components within the namespace.
I am using Java Config and importing that XML with @ImportResource from my java configuration file.  Since I noticed a post was just made on how to configure spring data JPA with java configuration I will try that as a work around.  I have classified this as a minor bug as things seem to still work normally but I am trying to introduce Spring data into one of my enterprise projects and a big red X does not instill a lot of faith 
Thanks,
