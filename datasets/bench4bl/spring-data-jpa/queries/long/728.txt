I have an Exception 'java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Total must not be less than the number of elements given!' throw in 'org.springframework.data.domain.PageImpl.<init>(PageImpl.java:45)'.
The complete stack is attached.
After some debugging, I have the scenario to reproduce it :
The important idea is to manage pagination, two requests are done : a first one to get total line count, and an other one to get the lines.
1 In my case I have 40 lines in the table, I retrieve a 100-size-page (page 0)
2 the count return 40
3 another thread insert a new entry
4 the second request retrieve the first 100 results » 41
5 The PageImpl constructor crash because its has a total count of 40 and 41 content entities.
I use this table to store messages to consumer thread. The workaround I found is to retrieve 1-size-page…
Should the second request limit the request with the requested total (40) but not the page size (100) ; Or should the total (40) be overridden by the actual total is superior ?
