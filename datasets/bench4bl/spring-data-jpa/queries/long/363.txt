SimpleJpaRepository.delete(ID id) calls exists(…) to detect whether an entity with the given identifier exists. If that's the case it loads the entity and passes it on.
The exists call is superfluous as we can simply check the result of findOne(…) for null and thus avoid the additional SQL statement to be executed.
