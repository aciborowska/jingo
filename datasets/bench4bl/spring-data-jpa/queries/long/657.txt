Prior to Spring 4.1.4 release, TransactionManager selection logic was determined by choosing the transaction manager reference associated when scanning repositories (such as the transactionManagerRef attribute in @EnableJpaRepositories). Seems this selection changed to look for the default transaction manager bean, ignoring the value set in the annotation. See SPR-12606 for more information on the change.
