At the end of the section "4.3.4. Using @Query" in the documentation(http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#jpa.query-methods.at-query), you are showing the following code example:






public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {




Â 




  @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE EMAIL_ADDRESS = ?0", nativeQuery = true)




  User findByEmailAddress(String emailAddress);




}







I think it should say ?1 instead of ?0.
Btw, is it possible to create PRs for documentation as well? I haven't found a repository for the reference documentation yet.
