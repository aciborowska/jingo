Actually ran into this problem in the Hades library but I see the code is still the same.  Using EclipseLink (2.1.3), the id is already set on the entity when it is passed to the method annotated with @PrePersist and @PreUpdate so calling isNew() on the entity to determine if the creation audits should be applied doesn't work (always returns false).  I suggest splitting the @PrePersist and @PreUpdate to separate methods and not using isNew().
