This relates directly to DATAJPA-885. The issue described there still occurs when a query returns a standard JPA projection consisting of a single type, where Spring Data JPA doesn't recognize that the type can be mapped by the JPA provider itself. In my case this happens when returning a collection of Joda LocalDate instances. 
I've attached a small sample app with a unit test that shows the problem. The same test also shows that a direct JPA query does work.
It would be nice if Spring Data JPA could somehow detect that I'm not trying to use its projection feature in this case, to prevent the "No aliases found in result tuple" error from happening.
