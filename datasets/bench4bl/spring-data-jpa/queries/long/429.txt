I have came across an issue where if I use @Query with hql, I cannot have a vararg as a parameter. I CAN have a vararg if I just create a method name like 'findByPropertyIn(String... str)' 
Now, if I try @Query("from Entity e where e.property in ?1") I get this exception:
org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: Encountered array-valued parameter binding, but was expecting [some class].
