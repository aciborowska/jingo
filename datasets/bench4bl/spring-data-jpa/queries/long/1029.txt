Using projection interfaces with inheritance might lead to occassions where JpaQueryCreator tries to create queries with duplicate multi-select aliases.
For example resulting in exceptions like these:






java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Multi-select expressions defined duplicate alias : id







I traced this back to two main causes:

Commons' DefaultProjectionInformation returns duplicate properties from {{getInputProperties()}
JpaQueryCreator uses these properties as is to create the multi-select

I'm not entirely sure, if that duplicated information might be of some use in other implementations, but JPA / Hibernate is definitely having a problem with those.
A simple suggestion to solve the problem would be to use a HashSet instead of an ArrayList in JpaQueryCreator#complete(Predicate, Sort, CriteriaQuery, CriteriaBuilder, Root).
