SonarQube reports a few package cycles, stemming mostly from JpaEntityMetadata being in the wrong package and Jpa21Utils reaching back out into the query package.
We probably should also update the architecture definition for Sonargraph. Consider back-porting to 1.7.x and 1.6.x as the type moves might cause difficulties for cherry picking bug fixes into maintenance branches.
