I try to run bundle that use spring-data-jpa on Virgo Tomcat Server.
When the server try to install spring-data-jpa, 
it told cannot resolve javax.annotation;version="[1.3.0,2.0.0)".
I cannot find javax.annotation with version 1.3.0+ bundle, 
I meet only javax.annotation with version 1.1 bundle.
Where do I get that bundle?
