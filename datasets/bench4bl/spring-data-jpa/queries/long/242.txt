Spring Data has a dependency range for Spring TX which triggers it to download a build snapshot version.
See:






[INFO] +- org.springframework.data:spring-data-jpa:jar:1.1.1.RELEASE:compile




[INFO] |  +- org.springframework.data:spring-data-commons-core:jar:1.3.2.RELEASE:compile




[INFO] |  +- org.springframework:spring-tx:jar:3.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT:compile




[INFO] |  \- org.aspectj:aspectjrt:jar:1.6.12:compile






Verified by mvn clean install on both, with no previous repository entries for Spring Data JPA and Spring TX. The workaround we currently employ is to add an exclusion in the Spring Data JPA dependency for Spring TX. The suggestion solution is to have a stable dependency for Spring TX.
