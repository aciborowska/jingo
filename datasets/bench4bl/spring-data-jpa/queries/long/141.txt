Currently repository interfaces cannot be used with a @MappedSuperclass annotated JPA entity class as we try to lookup an EntityType from the EntityManager's Metamodel which MappedSuperclass aren't. We should rather use ….managedType(…) and see if it implements IdentitifiedType to look for id information.
