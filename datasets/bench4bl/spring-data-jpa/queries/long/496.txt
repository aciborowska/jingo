We currently don't support finderQueries for ElementCollection since we don't generate the necessary joins.
E.g.: The following use case dosen't work at the moment:






...




@ElementCollection private Set<String> attributes;




...












...




List<User> findByAttributesIn(Set<String> attributes);




...
