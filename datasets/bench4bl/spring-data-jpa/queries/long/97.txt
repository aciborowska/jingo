Getting a query derived from the method name is very nice but when it's annotated with @QueryHints, hints don't get applied.
For example:






// This does not cache




@QueryHints(value = { @QueryHint(name = org.hibernate.ejb.QueryHints.HINT_CACHEABLE, value = "true") })




User findByUsername(String p_username);




Â 




// This works like it should




@QueryHints(value = { @QueryHint(name = org.hibernate.ejb.QueryHints.HINT_CACHEABLE, value = "true") })




@Query(value = "SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.username = ?1")




User findByUsername(String p_username);
