The @OneToOne annotation isn't recognized as an association annotation so in Spring Data REST I have to call PersistentProperty.isEntity() on the property passed to my handler in PersistentEntity.doWithProperties() in addition to processing known associations via the PersistentEntity.doWithAssociations() helper.
