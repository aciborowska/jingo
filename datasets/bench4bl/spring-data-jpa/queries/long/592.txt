When applying the auditing annotations (@CreatedBy, @CreatedDate, @LastModifiedBy, @LastModifiedDate) to methods instead of fields in a class that does not implement the org.springframework.data.domain.Auditable interface, auditing does not work.
The reason for this seems to be that the org.springframework.data.auditing.AuditableBeanWrapperFactory#getBeanWrapperFor(Object source) method will call into the org.springframework.data.auditing.AnnotationAuditingMetadata#AnnotationAuditingMetadata constructor, which only checks fields but not methods.
It would be nice to update the org.springframework.data.auditing.AnnotationAuditingMetadata#AnnotationAuditingMetadata constructor to look for the annotations on methods as well. Otherwise, the auditing annotations shouldn't be allowed to be applied to methods in the first place.
Related to this but probably a separate issue is the fact that the org.springframework.data.domain.Auditable interface enforces a JodaTime date. It would be nice if that could be more generic.
