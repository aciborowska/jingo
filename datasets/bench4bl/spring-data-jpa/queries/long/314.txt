I'm still seeing XML validation errors in STS 3.1 (Eclipse 3.8), with Spring-Data JPA 1.2 or 1.3, and Spring 3.1 or 3.2. With Spring 3.0 its fine.
sch-props-correct.2: A schema cannot contain two global components with the same name; this schema contains two occurrences of 'http://www.springframework.org/schema/tool,annotation'.
There is a forum thread with more details here:

Some people seem to have found some odd workaround, but none of them work for me.
The thread started with the original issue reported here (DATAJPA-160), however it seems it was not resolved completely for some of us.
