When using @Query in a JPA repository along with Pageable and attempting to sort on a field in a joined entity, the from entity gets prepended to the sort field. For example, if I do the following query:






@Query(value = "select p from Customer c join c.productOrder p where p.delayed = true")






If I pass a PageRequest sorting on a field in the from entity (Customer), everything will work fine:






PageRequest page = new PageRequest(0, 20, Direction.DESC, "lastName");






However, if I simply decide to sort by a field in the ProductOrder entity with this PageRequest:






PageRequest page2 = new PageRequest(0, 20, Direction.DESC, "p.lineItems");






I will get the following error:






Caused by: org.hibernate.QueryException: could not resolve property: p of: hello.Customer [select p from hello.Customer c join c.productOrder p where p.delayed = true order by c.p.lineItems desc]






c. was prepended onto the sort field. I am attaching a modified version of the Spring Data JPA tutorial from the Spring site that illustrates the issue.
