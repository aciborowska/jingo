It looks like spring-data-jpa 1.1.2.RELEASE depends on spring-core 3.2.0-SNAPSHOT. The reason is the <repository> definition from spring-data-jpa itself: 






<repository>




   <id>spring-libs-snapshot</id>




   <url>http://repo.springsource.org/libs-snapshot</url>




</repository>






This makes the ranged version to simply pick up the latest it finds, which, with the repository enabled, are the SNAPSHOT versions
The relevant build output is:






Downloaded: http://repo.springsource.org/libs-sn...n-metadata.xml (375 B at 0.9 KB/sec)






A quick solution should be to remove the snapshot repository from the pom of spring-data-jpa (which would make sense). Another possible solution would be to not use ranged versions, but that should not be necessary once the snapshot repository definition is removed.
