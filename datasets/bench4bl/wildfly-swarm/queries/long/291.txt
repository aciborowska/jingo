Because my Arq test run as clientI, I added resteasy-client dependency with test scope in pom.xml (if not, ClassNotFoundException: org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyClientBuilder will be thrown).
And then, I got the following exception.






RuntimeException: RESTEASY003190: Could not find constructor for class: org.jboss.resteasy.core.AsynchronousDispatcher







The full log is attached and my sample is here.
