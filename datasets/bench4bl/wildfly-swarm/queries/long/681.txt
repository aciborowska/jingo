If a health endpoint is defined at path /app/health, it's primarily available under /health/app/health. If it's unsecured, it's also available at the original path /app/health, but if it's secured, the original path /app/health returns 403.
That's inconsistent and counter-intuitive. I believe that all original paths should just return 301 redirect to /health/..., regardless of the security constraints.
