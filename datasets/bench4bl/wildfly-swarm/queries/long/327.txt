You can run the example from here: https://github.com/johnament/wildfly-swarm-examples/tree/master/jaxrs/jaxrs-shrinkwrap
After building the app, run it and go to a URL that shouldn't work, e.g. http://localhost:8080/dammitbob and see that you get the default not found exception handler.  Creating a provider for NotFoundException generally works in WildFly 10.
