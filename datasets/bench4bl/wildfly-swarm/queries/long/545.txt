Between BOM 1.0.0.CR1 and 1.0.0.Final the speed in which the application gets to:






11:05:39,631 INFO  [org.jboss.msc] (main) JBoss MSC version 1.2.6.Final







...in my project has significantly increased from 3 seconds to 4 minutes and the temp directory usage has increased from 54MB to 170MB.
I attempted to isolate the issue by using a simple project (POM attached) and the time went from 2 seconds to 7 seconds and 2MB to 4MB using CR1 and Final respectively.
Although faster it exhibits the same behaviour albeit at a smaller scale. When projects scale up it makes it unusable from an IDE as waiting minutes for startup is just not practice.
