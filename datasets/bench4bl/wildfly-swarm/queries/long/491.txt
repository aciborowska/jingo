Cannot use Arquillian Wildfly Swarm Container with Gradle since it throws an exception regarding it cannot resolve pom.xml.
The approach to fix it is by using this: https://discuss.gradle.org/t/getting-dependencies-using-gradle-tooling/17793/2 and just do a check if there is a build.gradle file or pom.xml file and act accordantly at https://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-core/blob/master/arquillian/api/src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/arquillian/adapter/WildFlySwarmObserver.java#L66
