It would be nice to catch those exceptional stack-traces, since they aren't truly that exceptional within the context of WildFly Swarm.
We should probably still log them as WARN or even ERROR, but without the stack-trace.  The stack is super scary, and not at all useful.  But a simpler, less scary message would be good.
Dunno if these percolate high enough for us to catch'em, but worth investigating.
