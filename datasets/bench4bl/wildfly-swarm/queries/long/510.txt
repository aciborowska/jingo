I have a class that implements javax.resource.Referenceable (as part of a JCA adapter) and it is not resolved during compile-time.
It looks like the following dependency is missing (used in javax.resource.api module): 






<dependency>




   <groupId>org.jboss.spec.javax.resource</groupId>




   <artifactId>jboss-connector-api_1.5_spec</artifactId>




</dependency>
