On the Prerequisites page on the website (http://wildfly-swarm.io/tutorial/prerequisites/), there is a typo in the second paragraph of the "Download and install WildFly" section.
The page says:
"Make note of the <WILDFLY_IP>, which by defaultâ€™s localhost"
but should say:
"Make note of the <WILDFLY_IP>, which by default is localhost"
