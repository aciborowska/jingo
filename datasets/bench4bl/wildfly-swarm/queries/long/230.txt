_Originally reported as https://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-examples/issues/50_
When running static-war example as a Java application from Eclipse, executing the org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm main class, the server starts properly, Howdy is dispayed on http://localhost:8080/, but if the index.html page is updated, the content is not reloaded in the browser.
This is something Bob McWhirter and I discussed last September. Although the original issue was deleted from github, I still have that quote from Bob:

You can edit your static content and they will appear. 
It uses a mixture of file and classloader-based undertow resource handlers, 
so that filesystem wins, allowing continual editing within a running app.
It seems Benjamin Browning might be involved in that issue.
