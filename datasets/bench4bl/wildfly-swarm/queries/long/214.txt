Currently, we have
.as(RibbonArchive.class).serviceName("foo")
It would be good if we took the service-name from the archive name, and more generally just had an .advertise() flag.
Additionally, some easy way to advertise something such as the keycloak-auth.war, where we don't construct the archive.  Perhaps additions to the RibbonFraction of things-to-advertise.
