Explanation of deployment package:






<bobmcw> if you put things in org.wildfly.swarm.flyway.deployment.* java package




<bobmcw> they are "invisible" to the :api and :runtime bits, it's just a sidecar to stuff things




<bobmcw> and they end up being known as org.wildfly.swarm.flyway:deployment module




<bobmcw> so that's the one to @DeploymentModule(name="org.wildfly.swarm.flyway", slot="deployment")




<bobmcw> to mix into the deployment







I added a class that implements ServletContextListener under the org.wildfly.swarm.flyway.deployment package and got the following: 






<gastaldi> 2016-10-20 16:52:55,479 INFO  [org.jboss.weld.Bootstrap] (ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3) WELD-000119: Not generating any bean definitions from org.wildfly.swarm.flyway.deployment.FlywayMigrationServletContextListener because of underlying class loading error: Type org.wildfly.swarm.flyway.deployment.FlywayMigrationServletContextListener from [Module "swarm.container:main" from BootModuleLoader@78b1cc93 for finders [BootstrapClasspathModuleFinder, BootstrapModuleFinder(org.wildfly.swarm.bootstrap:main), ClasspathModuleFinder, ContainerModuleFinder(swarm.container:main), ApplicationModuleFinder(swarm.application:main)]] not found.  If this is unexpected, enable DEBUG logging to see the full error.




<bobmcw> that shouldn't be visible to :runtime stuff and our weld




<gastaldi> the class was deployed as you said




<bobmcw> I wonder if we've need more help on the fraction-plugin to exclude :deployment bits.




<bobmcw> ah, the jandex'ing




<bobmcw> I think




<bobmcw> jandex indexes everything, but the class ultimately isn't loadable




<bobmcw> ignorable for now




<gastaldi> I added a @Vetoed to it




<bobmcw> it's just an INFO (warning)




<bobmcw> shouldn't have to do that, but yah, that's one way




<bobmcw> gastaldi: wanna file a JIRA about that INFO warning?




<bobmcw> we've discussed it but I keep forgetting to address it.
