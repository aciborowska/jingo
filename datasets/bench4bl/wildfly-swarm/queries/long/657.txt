On my laptop, a simple mvn clean install fails on the ArquillianTest with






2016-09-05 08:59:54,708 ERROR [org.jboss.msc.service.fail] (MSC service thread 1-5) MSC000001: Failed to start service wildfly.swarm.arquillian.daemon.runner: org.jboss.msc.service.StartException in service wildfly.swarm.arquillian.daemon.runner: Failed to start service

This is caused by another application already listening on port 12345. In my case, that application is the HipChat client. Sorry, I can't just stop using it right now , so I need a way to change the Arquillian Daemon's port. There's TODO: allow overriding the default port? for that already in DaemonServiceActivator.DaemonService.start.
A simple system property would work just fine IMHO.
