@Inject @configurationValue (https://github.com/cmoulliard/swarm-keycloak/blob/fabric8/src/main/java/io/swagger/demo/HelloWorldEndpoint.java#L32-L34) doesn't work for me using Swarm 2016.9 which is packaged as a jar file & running as a pod in openshift
When Swarm boots, the key/values are well populated (https://github.com/cmoulliard/swarm-keycloak/blob/fabric8/src/main/java/io/swagger/demo/RestServiceApp.java#L22-L33) but not injected within the Rest Endpoint class
Instructions to be used to reproduce the issue
https://github.com/cmoulliard/swarm-keycloak/tree/fabric8#openshift
When you call the service --> http $(minishift service swarm-rest --url=true)/say/hello






HTTP/1.1 200 OK

we should get this message as response "Hello from WildFly Swarm running on OpenShift!" but the response is empty and the console of the server will display 
"[INFO] Pod> 13:01:53,145 INFO  [stdout] (default task-1) Message : null"
