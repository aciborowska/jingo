We previously had a pattern for <packaging>war</packaging> projects where we would use the maven-war-plugin to packagingExcludes things matching wildfly-swarm-*.jar.
Due to the simplification of our artifactId, that's no longer possible.
BuildTool could be smarter to scrap out foo.jar and foo-modules.jar and anything else swarm-related from a WEB-INF/lib/** when packaging up the -swarm.jar.
