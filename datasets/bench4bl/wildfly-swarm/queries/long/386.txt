Apparently, addAllDepnedencies() add unnecessary librarties to WEB-IN/lib when wildfly-swarm:run or Arq Tests.
As a reuslt, some libraries will conflict with libraries provided WildFly.
uberjar works, so I suspect this is caused from classpath difference.
I attached my reproducer log. In this case thrown ClassCastException.
