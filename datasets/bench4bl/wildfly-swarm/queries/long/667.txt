If a project defines WIldFly Swarm dependencies in a Maven Profile, any tests in the project are unable to find the bootstrap.jar from WildFly Swarm.
Problem appears to be in UberjarSimpleContainer when it loads the `pom.xml` file and resolves the dependencies. Without a profile on that resolution, it doesn't find the dependencies
