When building an uber jar without auto detect, it's possible to end up in a situation where the version of a required fraction is not available in the m2repo of the uber jar.
An example of this is /jaxrs/swagger from our examples repo.
Because `swagger` depends on a released version of -core, and is listed prior to `jaxrs`in `pom.xml`, then the released version of `msc` is listed in `wildfly-swarm-application.conf` even though m2repo contains the next SNAPSHOT version. This causes a ModuleLoadException when running the uber jar
