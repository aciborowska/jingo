RemotingLegacyConnectorCustomizer believes that the default port number for the legacy remoting connector is 4777, but that's wrong. It's 4447 (see e.g. https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6/html/Installation_Guide/Network_Ports_Used_By_JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform_62.html).
