If an application uses a jar which also just happens to be used by WildFly Swarm itself, we can find ourselves in a predicament where the dependency is removed from being available to the app.
WildFly Swarm should be entirely less clever (while being more clever) about how it manages dependencies that are used by both WFS and the application.
