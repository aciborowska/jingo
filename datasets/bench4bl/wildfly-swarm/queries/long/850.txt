After the recent integration of @Configurable, some calls to System.getProperty remained in the code base (in things like Fraction-s, Customizer-s, ArchivePreparer-s and such):

ConsulTopologyFraction
H2DatasourceCustomizer
HystrixArchivePreparer
KeycloakServerCustomizer
LoggingFraction
MySQLDatasourceCustomizer
PostgreSQLDatasourceCustomizer
SwaggerWebAppFraction
WebServicesFraction

I understand that the database-related customizers are going away, but the remaining ones are valid.
