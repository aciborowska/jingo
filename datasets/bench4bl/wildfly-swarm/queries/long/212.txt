For the case where someone has taken a <packaging>war</packaging> application and added the wildfly-swarm-plugin, but hasn't added any other specific wildfly-swarm-* dependencies, it would be good if the PackageMojo and StartMojo could use the analysis half of SwarmTool to determine what fractions/dependencies to add.
Basically a maven-driven version of SwarmTool which uses the existing PackageMojo for the actual construction of the -swarm.jar after using the analysis portion of SwarmTool to figure out dependencies to add implicitly.
