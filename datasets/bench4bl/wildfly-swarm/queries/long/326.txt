Running the ribbon example gives JavaScript errors when clicking the buttons.
For both GET buttons the following error is logged:
SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data
processResponse()
 topology.js:100
changeState/<()
 topology.js:89
 topology.js:100:28
For the POST button the following error is logged:
POST 
XHR 
http://127.0.0.1:8080/127.0.0.1:8083/ [HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed 9ms]
Sending GET requests with curl to the time and event service gives correct responses.
