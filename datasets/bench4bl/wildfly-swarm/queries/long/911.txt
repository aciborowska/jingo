The rules for fraction autodetection (fraction-packages.properties) are insufficient for some Java EE components. Specifically:






batch-jberet=javax.batch







There are no classes in the javax.batch package, it's all in the subpackages.






jaxrs=javax.ws.rs




jaxrs-jaxb=javax.ws.rs+javax.xml.bind*




jaxrs-jsonp=javax.ws.rs+javax.json




jaxrs-validator=javax.ws.rs+javax.validation*







There's a bunch of subpackages in javax.ws.rs. For example, the JAX-RS Client API seems to be usable without referencing any class from the javax.ws.rs package, just the subpackages.
Also, for the jaxrs-jsonp rule, there are also subpackages in javax.json.






jpa=javax.persistence







There's a bunch of subpackages in javax.persistence.






mail=javax.mail







There's a bunch of subpackages in javax.mail.






transactions=javax.transaction







There's one subpackage in javax.transaction.






undertow=javax.servlet







There's a bunch of subpackages in javax.servlet. Also there's a package javax.websocket that should be included in this rule.






webservices=javax.jws







There's one subpackage in javax.jws. Also there's a package javax.xml.ws that should be included in this rule.
