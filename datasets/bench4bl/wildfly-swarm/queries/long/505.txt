Hi,
I'm facing problems when using the the Monitoring Fraction. I created my own HealthResource which returns the HealtStatus similar to what is described in https://wildfly-swarm.gitbooks.io/wildfly-swarm-users-guide/content/advanced/monitoring.html. 
Using the withAttribute() method of HealthStatus twice or more won't propose the result with every given attribute but replace the previously added ones.
I suppose this is because within the HealtStatus' withAttribute() Method ModelNode's set() is called instead of add() which will only "change this node's value to a property with the given name and value" (https://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-core/blob/master/monitor/api/src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/monitor/HealthStatus.java).
Is this the desired behaviour?
