When building with gradle an a StackOverflowError occurs when there is a 3rd-party dependency with circular dependencies to other 3rd-party-libs. (Recursion in method "fullTree")
In gradle I have to possibility to force the build to take another version of the 3rd-party lib, which may have fixed the circular error. (https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.html). But this option to quick-fix the error from outside the swarm-buildplugin doesn't work, because the GradleArtifactResolvingHelper from swarm is using  a detached configuration, where I can't define this forced-dependencies.
The GradleArtifactResolvingHelper should use gradle-features to resolve the artifacts from a specific configuration instead of implement this with the recursive method 'fullTree'. gradle can handle this circular dependencies and is much faster! The ResolvingHelper should also apply the forced-versions from the resolutionstrategy of the configuration 'compile' to the detached configuration.
