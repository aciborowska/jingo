Hi, 
since migrating to 1.0.0.CR2 yesterday I've been facing problems with an exception mapper (javax.ws.rs.ext.ExceptionMapper) which previously mapped all com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException properly but now gets ignored. I couldn't figure out any changes in the changelog at first glance that might have caused this behaviour. 
Returning back to CR1 would solve the problem. I am currently not able to debug the whole chain myself so I was very happy if anyone has an idea. 
Other Mappers are still working fine. Has a specific ExceptionMapper for JsonProcessingExceptions respectively JsonMappingException been added which causes some interdependencies now?
