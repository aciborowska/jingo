(Please note that I'm ignoring the Swarm bootstrap logging completely here.)
Before the logging subsystem kicks in, logging is configured by logging.properties. The default logging format defined in the logging subsystem by the LoggingFraction is subtly different from logging.properties. See:






12:48:55,391 INFO  [org.jboss.as] (MSC service thread 1-7) WFLYSRV0049: WildFly Swarm 2016.9 (WildFly Core 2.2.0.Final) starting







and






2016-10-03 12:48:55,952 INFO  [org.jboss.as] (Controller Boot Thread) WFLYSRV0025: WildFly Swarm 2016.9 (WildFly Core 2.2.0.Final) started in 669ms - Started 60 of 68 services (15 services are lazy, passive or on-demand)







I believe that the default configurations in the LoggingFraction and logging.properties should be consistent, so that there's no such difference.
