When using auto detection of WildFly Swarm dependencies the plugin will correctly select which Fractions are needed, but then depending on what is there, and their respective versions, the nearest dependency selection policy of Maven can easily result in older versions of dependent Fractions being selected.
For instance, with the `jaxrs-war` example it auto detects `swagger` and `jaxrs`. Each of those depend on `undertow`. The problem is that both `undertow` dependencies are at the same dependency depth causing the first one found to be used, which in this instance is the one inside `swagger` which is older than the one in `jaxrs`
