Scenario:

Added a dependency to the Booker example (io.zipkin.brave:brave-jaxrs2:3.9.1)
This dependency has a JAX-RS filter and expects a CDI bean to be injected
This bean is produced by a transitive dependency (io.zipkin.brave:brave-core:3.9.1)
On boot, a "dependency is not satisfied" message appears

This can be reproduced with the following branch:
https://github.com/jpkrohling/booker/tree/SWARM-624-Reproducer
I tried to add them directly as dependency for the deployment (addAsLibrary("gav")), but that didn't seem to do the trick. It looks like the dependencies aren't being scanned by the Weld for possible beans.
