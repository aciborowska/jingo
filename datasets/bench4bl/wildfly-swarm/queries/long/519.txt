When creating a @MessageDriven bean that is bound to a different listener (VertxListener or MailListener as in https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/InboundJavaMail}
WildFly requires the usage of @ResourceAdapter annotation, bound to the deployed RAR. 
This annotation is available in the following dependency, which may need to be added to the EJB fraction API: 






    <dependency>




      <groupId>org.jboss.ejb3</groupId>




      <artifactId>jboss-ejb3-ext-api</artifactId>




    </dependency>
