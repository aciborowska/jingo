Hi there,
I have a problem when using javax.xml.ws.handler.Handler implementations and invoking a remote client web service method.
It's failing with a:






Caused by: javax.xml.soap.SOAPException: Unable to create message factory for SOAP: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException




 




	at javax.xml.soap.MessageFactory.newInstance(MessageFactory.java:112)




 




	at org.apache.cxf.binding.soap.saaj.SAAJFactoryResolver.createMessageFactory(SAAJFactoryResolver.java:56)




 




	at org.apache.cxf.binding.soap.saaj.SAAJOutInterceptor.getFactory(SAAJOutInterceptor.java:87)




 




	at org.apache.cxf.binding.soap.saaj.SAAJOutInterceptor.handleMessage(SAAJOutInterceptor.java:123)




 




	... 64 more












which suggests to me some kind of collision between the Oracle Java 8 web service client and the CXF implementation in WildFly.
The same code works perfectly OK when deployed as a regular WAR into WildFly 10.0.0.Final.
I'm running with WildFly Swarm 1.0.0.Final and:






java version "1.8.0_60"




 




Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)




 




Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.60-b23, mixed mode)







I've started trying to investigate based on the current jaxws example but it seems like I have a bunch of cascading build issues to sort out first.
Thanks
