When I add a source-jar with an extra task to my gradle-project (without war-plugin applied), the swarm gradle-plugin wraps the source-jar instead of the "classes"-jar into the swarm uber-jar (<swarm-uber-jar>/_bootstrap/<sources>.jar). This way running the uber-jar fails.
I apply the source-jar the following way:






task sourcesJar(type: Jar, dependsOn: classes) { classifier = 'sources' from sourceSets.main.allSource }




Â 




artifacts { archives sourcesJar }







I think it's because of the logic in the gradle-plugin "PackagePlugin" which just chooses the latest added task of the type "Jar".
