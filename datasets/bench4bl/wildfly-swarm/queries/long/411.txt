When SpringBoot'ing, the user ideally includes zero Swarm jars, but a lot of other random stuff is pulled in via the SpringBoot dependencies, which will affect which Swarm fractions are required.
If the entire resolved dependency tree from the pom.xml is feed to auto-detection (if enabled), that'd be sweet.  And fantabulous.
