We use a different delimiter for the com.sun.security.sasl.digest.realm property than the JDK, which uses commas, spaces, newlines, or tab characters.  This makes it impossible to correctly emulate the property to the mechanism while using the callback to acquire the actual list.  Since code changes would likely be required to use the new version with only a comma delimiter, it does not serve any compatibility purpose to continue to support this property.
Instead we should do three things:

Eliminate property support from our DigestSaslServer
Add a wrapping SaslServerFactory which detects when a mechanism is trying to acquire a realm list by reading the com.sun.security.sasl.digest.realm property, and uses the AvailableRealmsCallback to populate it (with a flag to support transformation of spaces, tabs, and newlines to NBSP (0xA0), and remove commas)
Add a wrapping SaslServerFactory which allows legacy users to specify a value for com.sun.security.sasl.digest.realm, and uses it to support AvailableRealmsCallback if that property was set, with programmable delimiters
