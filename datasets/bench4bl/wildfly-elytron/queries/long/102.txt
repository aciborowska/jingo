The following tests fail on Windows or any platform which does not have UTF-8 as its default encoding:

CompatibilityClientTest.testUtf8Charset
CompatibilityServerTest.testUtf8Charset

Can be reproduced on Linux on the command line by setting the LANG environment variable to something other than UTF_8, like ISO-8859-1.
