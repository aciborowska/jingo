The verifyCredential(Object credential) method is misleading.  It is in fact not generally possible or practical to verify a credential; rather what is being done is verifying a guess.
I propose a couple changes.  First, the argument to the method should be renamed "guess" to indicate that the object being passed in isn't a credential, but rather a credential-specific guess.
Second, I propose that Password no longer be considered a valid argument to this method.  The only use that serves is to extract a clear password guess anyway.
Finally, I think we should consider renaming the method to something else, like:

verifyCredentialGuess
verifyGuess
checkCredentialGuess
etc.
