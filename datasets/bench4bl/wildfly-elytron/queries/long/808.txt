e.g.






                    case "clear-password": {




                        function = andThenOp(function, credentialSource -> credentialSource.with(IdentityCredentials.NONE.withCredential(new PasswordCredential(ClearPassword.createRaw(ClearPassword.ALGORITHM_CLEAR, parseClearPassword(reader))))));




                        break;




                    }







The parsing of clear password is deferred until later.
