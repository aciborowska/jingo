Following scenarios which uses mentioned below username/password work correctly for properties file used by legacy solution and do not work for Elytron:






elytron:password                            // results to username elytron with password password




elytronumlautöäü=password                   // results to username elytronumlautöäü with password password




elytron用戶=password                        // results to username elytron用戶 with password password




backslash\\=password                        // results to username backslash\ with password password




backslash\\inthemiddle=password             // results to username backslash\inthemiddle with password password




dn\=elytron,dc\=wildfly,dc\=org=password    // results to username dn=elytron,dc=wildfly,dc=org with password password
