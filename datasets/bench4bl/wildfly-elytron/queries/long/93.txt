These tests have never run due to a pom.xml configuration mishap, and some of them fail:

ConnectionTests
PrincipalMappingTests
UserPasswordTests

After https://github.com/dmlloyd/wildfly-elytron/commit/d65a5a074d65 is fixed (PR https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-elytron/pull/40) it will just be a question of un-commenting the commented-out line in pom.xml to run the missing tests.
