In Digest-MD5 implementation is missing last step of authetication - generating and checking of rspauth.


Keys generated for encrypted communication in auth-conf are different from keys generated by JDK implementation - in their generating is bug. (keys are derivated from H(A1) by RFC, so must be identical in all implementations.)
