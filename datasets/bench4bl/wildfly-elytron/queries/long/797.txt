There are methods in Elytron LdapSecurityRealm class which create/get DirContext, but does not close him in finally block.
In some circumstances could cause context resource leak.

LdapSecurityRealm
	
getEvidenceVerifySupport
getCredentialAcquireSupport
getCredential
setCredentials




LdapRealmIdentity
	
setCredentials



In same class there are examples of properly closed contexts:

LdapRealmIdentity
	
getCredential
getEvidenceVerifySupport
verifyEvidence
getIdentity
create
setAttributes
