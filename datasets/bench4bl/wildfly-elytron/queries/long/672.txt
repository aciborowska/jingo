Elytron ldap-realm allows to use DN as username (e.g. full uid=jduke,ou=People,dc=jboss,dc=org can be used instead of jduke). However implementation requires that used DN must start with rdn-identifier in the same case sensitivity as is used in server configuration. Otherwise authentication fails. It means when server configuration uses rdn-identifier=uid then only uid=jduke,... can be correctly used, UID=jduke,... will fail. 
LDAP specification does not talk about case sensitivity of attributes, but most of LDAP servers work with attributes as case insensitive.
