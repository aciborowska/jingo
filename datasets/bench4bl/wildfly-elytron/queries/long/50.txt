This applies to RFC 2831 (using HTTP digest as a SASL mechanism): http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2831
By using space as the separator a single realm name that contains a space is split into two realms.
Either support quoted realm names if they contain a space or choose a different delimiter - (A different delimiter other than a control character may be difficult as the rest can appear in a realm name)
