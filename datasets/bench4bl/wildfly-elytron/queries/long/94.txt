The password implementations' engineGetKeySpec and engineConvertibleToKeySpec are all testing against an exact KeySpec type.  However this makes it impossible to acquire a general KeySpec of any type, and is also inconsistent with KeyFactory's behavior.
Change the implementations to use isAssignableFrom checks.  All implementations should allow a class of PasswordSpec or KeySpec to be passed in; in this case, that type's preferred KeySpec type will be returned.
