There are potentially overflowing expressions in org.wildfly.security.permission.LongNameSetPermissionCollection in getBitsForName method. Expressions 1 << nameEnumeration.size() and 1 << nameEnumeration.indexOf(name) are evaluated as integer but assigned to bits variable which is long. It can be avoided by casting 1 to long.
