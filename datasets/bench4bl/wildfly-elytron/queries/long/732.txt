There are complicated failure-descriptions in Elytron properties-realm. They include some details from exceptions which are not needed and can be confused for non-java administrators. Please handle these exceptions and provide some user friendly failure-description.
Examples of complicated failure-description in properties-realm:

Adding path which does not exist:






/subsystem=elytron/properties-realm=realm:add(users-properties={path=/wrong/path/a.properties})




{




    "outcome" => "failed",




    "failure-description" => {




        "WFLYCTL0080: Failed services" => {"org.wildfly.security.security-realm.realm" => "org.jboss.msc.service.StartException in service org.wildfly.security.security-realm.realm: WFLYELY00014: Unable to load the properties files required to start the properties file backed realm.




    Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /wrong/path/a.properties (No such file or directory)"},




        "WFLYCTL0412: Required services that are not installed:" => ["org.wildfly.security.security-realm.realm"],




        "WFLYCTL0180: Services with missing/unavailable dependencies" => undefined




    },




    "rolled-back" => true




}







Adding file with missing $REALM:






/subsystem=elytron/properties-realm=realm:add(users-properties={path=/some/path/roles.properties})




{




    "outcome" => "failed",




    "failure-description" => {




        "WFLYCTL0080: Failed services" => {"org.wildfly.security.security-realm.realm" => "org.jboss.msc.service.StartException in service org.wildfly.security.security-realm.realm: WFLYELY00014: Unable to load the properties files required to start the properties file backed realm.




    Caused by: java.io.IOException: ELY01006: No realm name found in properties file"},




        "WFLYCTL0412: Required services that are not installed:" => ["org.wildfly.security.security-realm.realm"],




        "WFLYCTL0180: Services with missing/unavailable dependencies" => undefined




    },




    "rolled-back" => true




}







path mentiond in relative-to does not exist:






/subsystem=elytron/properties-realm=realm:add(users-properties={path=users.properties,relative-to=non.exist})




{




    "outcome" => "failed",




    "failure-description" => {




        "WFLYCTL0412: Required services that are not installed:" => ["jboss.server.path.\"non.exist\""],




        "WFLYCTL0180: Services with missing/unavailable dependencies" => ["org.wildfly.security.security-realm.realm is missing [jboss.server.path.\"non.exist\"]"]




    },




    "rolled-back" => true




}








Suggestion for improvement:

use only description of failure, e.g. something like "file /wrong/path/a.properties was not found"
do not use any unneeded information - e.g. "WFLYCTL0180: Services with missing/unavailable dependencies" => undefined
