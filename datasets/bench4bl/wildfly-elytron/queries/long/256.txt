Currently this causes a FastUnsupportedCallbackException since these factories are the only thing to handle this callback. It doesn't really cause any problems, but I noticed this while debugging.
TLSServerEndPointChannelBindingSaslClientFactory removes the SSLCallback from the array before delegating, and the ChannelBinding ones should take the same approach from what I can tell.
