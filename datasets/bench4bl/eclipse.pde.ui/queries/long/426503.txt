In the TargetContentsGroup one can group the plugins by location. If a custom location type is involved then its icon doesn't show up, which looks odd. The cause is that TargetContentsGroup.createTree() uses a plain StyledBundleLabelProvider. With this code it seems to work for me:fTree.setLabelProvider(new StyledBundleLabelProvider(true, false) { @Override public Image getImage(Object element) { Image image = super.getImage(element); if (image == null    element instanceof ITargetLocation) { ILabelProvider provider = (ILabelProvider) Platform.getAdapterManager() .getAdapter(element, ILabelProvider.class); if (provider != null) { image = provider.getImage(element); } } return image; }});
