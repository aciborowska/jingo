I20131112-0800Luna should still allow to convert a 2.0-style plug-in from my workspace to an OSGi bundle with a MANIFEST.MF.2.0-style plug-ins were only seriously deprecated very late in Kepler, but they still worked there. Now, when I start Luna and have an old-style plug-in in my workspace (e.g. org.eclipse.swt.snippets from R4_3_maintenance), Ia) don't get any error in the Problems viewb) get a silent error in the log (the PDE builder should create a problem marker instead of a log entry):!ENTRY org.eclipse.pde.core 4 201 2013-11-18 15:05:39.250!MESSAGE Plug-in at 'C:\e\i\I20131112-0800\a\org.eclipse.swt.snippets' does not have a manifest. The PluginConverter service used to create manifests for old style plug-ins is not available, please install the 'org.eclipse.osgi.compatibility.plugins' compatibility fragment.c) can't convert the bundle to OSGi by clicking the "create an OSGi bundle manifest" link in the manifest editor.It's OK that Luna doesn't support 2.0-style plug-ins any more, but it still has to help the user with the transition. The advice to install the 'org.eclipse.osgi.compatibility.plugins' is bad. Normally, a user should NOT install that bundle, but should just fix the project. The compatibility bundle is not even easily available (bug 412886 comment 15). And I guess once it's installed, the user wouldn't even be forced to fix their bundle -- which is exactly the opposite from what we want to achieve.
