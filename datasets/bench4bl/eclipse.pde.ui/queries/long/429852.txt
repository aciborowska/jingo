I20140305-2000.Specify VM args to be specified for an OS / Arch combination does not work for me. Here's what I tried when I wanted to verify the N N entry.1. create plug-in project2. create new Product Configuration3. on 'Launching' tab's 'Launching Arguments' section select 'win32' tab4. change 'Architecture' combo to 'x86_64' ==  editor does not get dirty, no preview5. Ctrl+S ==  combo switches to 'sparc'6. close and reopen the product editor ==  value of the combo for 'win32' is reset to 'All Architectures'
