My subclass of AbstractBundleContainer does all the resolve() work in resolveBundles() and resolveFeatures() just returns the already cached fFeatures.In this scenario it's a little annoying that resolve() allocates one third of the overall work to resolveFeatures() in a hardcoded way.https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/21720/ adds override points for subclasses with a work ratio different from 2/1. With the current defaults it should not impact existing subclasses, but maybe some of them could make use of the new methods, too.
