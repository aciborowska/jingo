Created attachment 240423Target file to reproduce the problemThe ErrorLog view duplicates the children of MultiStatus entries. This code that has been changed in the context of bug 416507 to LogView.createLogEntry(IStatus) adds new child entries: private LogEntry createLogEntry(IStatus status) { LogEntry entry = new LogEntry(status); // [...] if (status.isMultiStatus()) { IStatus[] children = status.getChildren(); for (int i = 0; i   children.length; i++) { LogEntry childEntry = createLogEntry(children[i]); entry.addChild(childEntry); childEntry.setSession(currentSession); } }But child entries for the child statuses have already been added in new LogEntry(status).The problem can be reproduced with the attached test.target file. Just open it in an IDE and "Set as Target Platform". It shouldn't be able to resolve properly and as a result add nested multi statuses. They're displayed incorrectly in the ErrorLog view as you can see in the screenshot that I'll also attach.I've submitted a Gerrit review that also fixes the problem that the implicitely created child entries have no session set:https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/22151/
