Created attachment 241756Test fileWhen using version 0.0.0 for a dependency inside a target definition file, sometimes it doesn't resolve the latest version. You will find attached a test file that (sometimes) can reproduce the behavior with the guava and antlr dependencies. It should resolve guava 12.0.0 and antlr 3.2 but sometimes it resolves lower versions.
