The ManifestUtils class (from org.eclipse.pde.core 3.10.0 - Eclipse Luna) prints out the contents of the MANIFEST.MF file in a bad format. The Manifest-Version key-value pair should be printed in the first line of the file (instead it is handled only after the distinguished keys have been processed, see writeManifest method lines 249-260). This will cause problems when the manifest merging functionality is invoked from the org.eclipse.emf.codegen.ecore.generator.AbstractGeneratorAdapter class, because it is looking for the Manifest-Version to be the first entry in the file. In the previos version of the org.eclipse.pde.core plugin (version 3.9.0 - Eclipse Kepler) the ManifestUtils class did not exist, instead the PluginConverter class had a writeManifest method which handled the Manifest-Version key properly. Why did the implementation change? According to this site http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/courses/629/jdkdocs/guide/jar/manifest.html this entry should be the first in the file. At the moment this is a blocker issue for https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=419128.
