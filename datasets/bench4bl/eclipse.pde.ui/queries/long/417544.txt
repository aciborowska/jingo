Follow up to Bug 417096. When there is a problem with the bundle description we don't add it to the model. However, we also do not clear any existing bundle description, so the previous stale description will be used.In MinimalState.addBundle() line 76, when we catch a exception from creating the bundle description, we should clear the existing bundle description.
