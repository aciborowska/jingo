In the vogella trainings, a significant amount of participants are usually confused by the presence of the error log. They (newbies) don't understand that the errors are coming from the running IDE and not their RCP app. Thus, I wonder if we give too much attention to the error log or if it is better left hidden to be used by more experienced users.Also showing the error log right from startup might lead users to think Eclipse is not stable.Btw. I do know that the error log supports showing the log of the nested RCP app.
