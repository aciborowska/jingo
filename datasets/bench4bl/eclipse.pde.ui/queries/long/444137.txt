Created attachment 247079jstack thread outputVersion: Luna SR1 (4.4.1)Build id: M20140903-1600We have a product built on top of Eclipse and occasionally when my Eclipse starts up it blocks indefinitely at the splash screen with a prompt waiting for a username/password. (until I close the dialog)I've attached a jstack dump and you can see in Thread 60931 it appears that the target platform is being reloaded. The target platform that I am pointing to is on a remote server and requires a username/password.
