4.4 RC2.FUP of bug 421979.My test case always imported one of my demo bundles from CVS and then I replaced it with a version that did not have a manifest. Unfortunately, PDE can populate the PDE container during the initial import and then keeps it after replace. However, if one closes and reopens the project, or directly imports a 2.0 style bundle, then the PDE container won't resolve and the project stays full of errors. Hence, we should show an error when the compatibility bundle isn't installed and the message should say "to compile or run".
