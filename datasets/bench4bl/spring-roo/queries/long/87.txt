See attached PNG screenshot.  I have a JPA entity as defined below.  The auto scaffolding generates error messages that wrap.  In the case of a html text field, it appears that the error message starts at the left of the input box.  However, for the textarea, the error starts from the left side of the outer div, not from the left margin of the field.
Also, the date picker field error message starts properly from the left of the field, but wraps all the way to the left side of the div.  It could be the same as the text field, my error message wasn't that long.
Suggest we wrap the error messages from the field and keep them from wrapping left to the label.
