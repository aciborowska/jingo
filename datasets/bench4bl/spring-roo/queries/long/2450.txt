After creating a new roo project and running 'web flow', I tried to deploy to tomcat but I receive the following Error:
Error creating bean with name 'mvcViewFactoryCreator' defined in ServletContext resource [/WEB-INF/spring/webflow-config.xml]: Cannot resolve reference to bean 'tilesViewResolver' while setting bean property 'viewResolvers'; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No bean named 'tilesViewResolver' is defined
