persistence setup --provider HIBERNATE --database POSTGRES 
It appears that the persistence setup does not set the hibernate.dialect in the persistence.xml
Manually override 
    <property name="hibernate.dialect" value="org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect"/>
is the work around.
I found the problem when playing with the pet clinic and moved it from In Mem DB to Postgres.
