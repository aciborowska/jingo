I am not sure if this a bug of roo or of the sts. I have installed sts and extends it with roo 1.0.1.RELEASE.
Now I have created a new project. But this project is red, due to this dependency in the pom.xml:






pom.xml






<dependency>




    <groupId>org.springframework.roo</groupId>




    <artifactId>org.springframework.roo.annotations</artifactId>




    <version>1.0.0.RC4</version>




    <scope>provided</scope>




</dependency>
