Found this while investigating ROO-2806. To replicate:

Generate a project with an MVC layer (e.g. run "script vote.roo")
Edit an entity controller's @RooWebScaffold annotation to contain "create = false" and "update = false"
Roo does not remove the corresponding view definitions from the entity's views.xml file
