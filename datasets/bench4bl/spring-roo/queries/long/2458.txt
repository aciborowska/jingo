See the forum reference for details. I've classified this as critical because it stops users from running the getting started guide (http://www.springsource.org/roo/start) which is critical for a tool like spring roo.
The solution is add a GAE dependency using:
dependency add --groupId com.google.appengine --artifactId appengine-api-1.0-sdk --version 1.4.0 
I've tried this using both STS as well as a copy of eclipse with the relevant plugins installed.
