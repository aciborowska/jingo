Roo is thrashing in STS. It seemed happy at the command line. STS is definitely running 1.1.0.M4 [rev 62697a7]
To reproduce: 
  cd /tmp/
  mkdir rd
  cd rd
  rm -rf ~/src/spring-roo/bootstrap/target/osgi; roo-dev  "script expenses.roo" 
And import the result into STS 2.5.0.M3 as an existing maven project.
