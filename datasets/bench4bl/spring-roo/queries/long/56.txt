I get the following exception in the web list view if I name a field in an entity class "from": 
javax.persistence.PersistenceException: org.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException: could not execute query at
...
java.sql.SQLException: Table not found in statement [select holidayreq0_.id as id0_, holidayreq0_.version as version0_, holidayreq0_.from as from0_ from holiday_request holidayreq0_] 
Here is the class:
@Entity
@RooEntity
@RooJavaBean
@RooToString
public class HolidayRequest 
{

    @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
    private Date from;

}
