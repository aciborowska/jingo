I add my own domain class with JPA annotations to my Roo project.
The class already contains contains fields annotated as @Id and @Version.
The class also has getters and setters for both.
I still get error from Roo:
####
Created SRC_MAIN_JAVA\com\foo\Test_Roo_Plural.aj
Undo create SRC_MAIN_JAVA\com\foo\Test_Roo_Plural.aj
User provided @javax.persistence.Id field but failed to provide a public 'setId(id)' method in 'com.
foo.Test'

it seems the test for presence of setters is not working correctly.
The use-case for  maintaining @id and @version is to be able to define my own DB column mapping and constraints.
