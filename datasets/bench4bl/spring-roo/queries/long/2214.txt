I've setup my roo project.
I've  reversed engineered one table from my database, I generated my controller
I started my application with mvn tomcat:run
when I click List all xxx I get an Oracle error.
from log 
Hibernate:
    /* select
        count(o)
    from
        Spem1a o */ select
            *
        from
            ( select
                count((spem1a0_.MODE_PAIE,
                spem1a0_.NAS)) as col_0_0_
            from
                SPE.SPEM1A spem1a0_ )
        where
            rownum <= ?
