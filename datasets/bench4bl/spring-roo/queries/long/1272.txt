The POM for the mojo-addon module contains a duplicate dependency. The following dependency is declared twice:
        <dependency>
            <groupId>asm</groupId>
            <artifactId>asm-all</artifactId>
            <version>3.1</version>
        </dependency>
This is fine in Maven 2.x, but in Maven 3 this causes an error. This creates problems when trying to import Roo itself into Eclipse using m2eclipse (which uses Maven 3.x).
