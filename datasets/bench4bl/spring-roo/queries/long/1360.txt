It looks like the Selenium test output is placed one extra directory deep, in target/target rather than just in target.  The problem is due to the generated selenium configuration:
<results>$
{project.build.directory}/target/selenium.txt</results>
should be
<results>${project.build.directory}
/selenium.txt</results>
