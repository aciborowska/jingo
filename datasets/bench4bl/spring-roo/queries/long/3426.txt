For the following class, with Roo 1.2.2 no accessor methods are created for the @Transient attribute jpaUtil and in fact since there are no other attributes in this class the MyClass_Roo_JavaBean.aj file does not even get created. 
However with Roo 1.2.4 the MyClass_Roo_JavaBean.aj file does get created and it contains methods getJPAUtil() and setJPAUtil(..).
@RooJavaBean
@RooToString(excludeFields = "jpaUtil")
@RooJpaActiveRecord(mappedSuperclass = true)
@RooJson
public abstract class MyClass 
{

	@Autowired
	@Transient
	private transient JPAUtil jpaUtil;
