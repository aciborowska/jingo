When an entity is exposed by JSON in a Controller at @RooWebScaffold annotation with 'exposeJson = true' attribute, should be considered same annotation attributes:

create
update
delete

Else define it own JSON create, update and delete attributes.
There is a security problem when create, update or delete is disabled on MVC and not allow disabling on JSON either.
