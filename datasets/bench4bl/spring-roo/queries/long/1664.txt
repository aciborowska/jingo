If an entity is defined with a field starting with a capital letter i.e.
public class Person{
   private String Name;
}
the validateKeys method of JsonRequestProcessor will not allow a post of the GWT data.  The IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
I realize this is not javabean standard to start a field with a capital letter.  It was a mistake on my part but it did break the code and would not allow the data to be posted from the scaffolded GWT code.
