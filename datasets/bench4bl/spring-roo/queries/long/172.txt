Hi,
Currently the JsPDocumentHelper class of the mvc-jsp addon generates a table to list all entities of a kind. This tables have a misplaced tr and thead like this
<table>
   <tr>
       <thead>
             <th>...</th>
             <th>...</th>
               ..............
      </thead>
  </tr>
The tr tag should be a child of the thead tag instead
<table>
   <thead>
       <tr>
             <th>...</th>
             <th>....</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
The change is pretty trivial, patch attached
Regards
