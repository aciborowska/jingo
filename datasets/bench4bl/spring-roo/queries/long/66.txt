com.springsource.org.aspectj.tools-1.6.3.RELEASE.jar is not required in the main <dependencies> section of the template used by the "create project" command.  It should remain in the aspectj-maven-plugin <dependencies> list, though.
Removal of this JAR will reduce the packaged WAR payload by ~8.5 Mb.
