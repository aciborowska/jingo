I scaffolded a new project with GAE 1.5.4 and GWT 2.4.0
Everything works well to the point there is the first Request Factory Call when I get this error:
The RequestFactory ValidationTool must be run for the com.qunb.app.client.managed.request.ApplicationRequestFactory RequestFactory type
Since it's a new validator coming with GWT 2.4.0, I tried to fix it through the pom according to 
http://googlewebtoolkit.blogspot.com/2011/09/working-with-maven-and-requestfactory.html
so I add 2 dependencies and the 2 extra plugins, but then the build will never be successful (plugin processing failure).
Then, removing plugins, this addition of the sole dependencies fix that.
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.google.web.bindery</groupId>
   <artifactId>requestfactory-server</artifactId>
   <version>2.4.0</version>
  </dependency>
  <!-- see sample projects for correct placement -->
  <dependency>
   <groupId>com.google.web.bindery</groupId>
   <artifactId>requestfactory-apt</artifactId>
   <version>2.4.0</version>
  </dependency>
