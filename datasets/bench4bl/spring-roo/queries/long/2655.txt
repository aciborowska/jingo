Hi , I created a new Spring Roo Project but in my Date field it is showing numbers instead of Alphabets , like for Jan-Dec it shows 1-12 and for Mon-Sun it shows 1-7.
Attaching the image.
I upgraded the spring-js-resources to the latest version 2.3.0. But to no avail.
But some projects it works. It shows August and everything properly. Can someone please help me what exactly is the matter Here
