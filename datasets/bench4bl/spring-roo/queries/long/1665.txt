When in package explorer, if right click on project, I have for option [Refactor->Push In...]. So first if it's an option that should mean something can be done. Then the option has 3 dots [...], so a dialog should show up after been click.
I do not get the dialog and nothing is [Push In]
I have only one project, one class, and 2 fields. The class is marked with:
@RooJavaBean
@RooToString
@RooEntity
I do not know how to provide more relevant information, it just doesn't do anything...
Obviously, end user expected result is that everything that is generated by AJ due to the @Roo* annotation will be moved to the real Java class.
