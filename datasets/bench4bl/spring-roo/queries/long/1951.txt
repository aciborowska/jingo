By default, JSTL c:out escapes text (escapeXml attribute is true by default, http://bit.ly/eUItyd). This causes special characters are scaped.
You have an example at pagination.tagx, spanish word for "page" is "página" that is rendered as "página" by the following code at pagination.tagx:
    <spring:message code="list_size" var="list_size" />
    <c:out value="$
{list_size} " />

This issue is solved by setting escapeXml to false:

    <spring:message code="list_size" var="list_size" />
    <c:out value="${list_size}
 " escapeXml="false" />
