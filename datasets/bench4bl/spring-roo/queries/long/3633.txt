Preferences => Spring => Roo Support
If I change the installation to 2.0.0.M1 (downloaded, unzipped, copied to the same root where 1.3.1.RC1 is), the shell won't start giving the message: "Please stand by until the Roo Shell is completely loaded."
If I select 1.3.1 and restart the IDE, the shell starts properly.
