I just noticed when doing a 'help' that 'controller all' has been deprecated in favor of 'web mvc all'. However, when trying that command on a project that has persistency set up and an entity defined I'm getting an error message stating that the command is not currently available. 'controller all' works though, so it seems like there's a broken availability check for the new spring mvc version of the command.
