Running into some issues since 1.1.1. When I first ran the update it detected our custom ConversionService, so I followed instructions, removed that and pushed the code into Roo's new ApplicationConversionServiceFactoryBean.
That class is also now mentioned in the webmvc-config. ie.
<mvc:annotation-driven conversion-service="applicationConversionService"/>
<bean class="xx.xxxx.xxxxxxx.web.ApplicationConversionServiceFactoryBean" id="applicationConversionService"/>
However the Roo Shell now gets stuck on all subsequent startups. I've tried removing the /cache and the temporary files, and restarting it fresh, but I get similar result.  What I can see, is that we have an application.properties that has around 2000 lines of labels, and if I delete that and let Roo regenerate it is gets through about 1300 of them before silently stalling and refusing to go any futher.  
If I leave the application.properties alone, I can see it creating hundreds of 100kb copies of this application.properties in the temp dir while it is processing updates., Roo starts, and appears to do nothing, but never becomes responsive. After 3-4 mins it ceases created temporary files in the background, but doesn't continue from that point.  Any attempt to use the Shell results in a "Still Loading" message.  Turning development mode to true doesn't output anything further.
We've been using Roo for coming up a year now, and this is a new problem to us.  Is there any way to get a clearer picture of what it is doing?  These are corporate dev machines, so they have any number of background tasks and scans running in the background that I have no ability to turn off, but I would have just expected that to slow file operations, Roo hasn't stalled completely before.
