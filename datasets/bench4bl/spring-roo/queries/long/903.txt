I just tried to build Roo with Maven 2.1.0.
It failed, with something like this:
[INFO] [exec:exec 
{execution: default}
]
[INFO] Git-Commit-Hash: 3a0b8a399aae14167139c185e4e31355e20d1f25
...
[INFO] [bundle:bundle]
[ERROR] Error building bundle org.springframework.roo:org.springframework.roo.st
artlevel:bundle:1.1.0.M1 : Included file e:\spring-roo\src\git\roo\startlevel\ta
rget\build-number.mf is directory
[ERROR] Error(s) found in bundle configuration
Obviously, the Git-Commit-Hash was written to STDOUT, but not to file build-number.mf.
Further analysis yields:  
The exec-maven-plugin is used in the Roo parent POM.
There, the property outputFile is used.
This property is not available before version 1.1-beta-2 of the plugin.
Thus, please, either state the plugin version explitely or set a minimum Maven version in the POM, that implies 1.1-beta-2 for the plugin.
