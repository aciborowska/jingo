Upon changing the name of an entity's flush method via the "flushMethod" attribute of its @RooEntity annotation, the Roo shell can display this message:






NullPointerException at org.springframework.roo.addon.test.IntegrationTestMetadata.getPersistMethodTest(IntegrationTestMetadata.java:449)






This happens because the getPersistMethodTest() method doesn't check whether the flush method is null before using it. It might be null because of a timing error whereby the annotation specifies a new flush method name but the entity's Xxx_Roo_Entity.aj ITD hasn't been rebuilt yet and therefore still introduces that method using its previous name.
