lets say I have  table called "comment" which has foreign key "username" referencing unique field "username" in "person" table.
Note, that I deliberately made foreign key referencing non primary key because of the limitation with user generated primary-keys. explained here: http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?t=84078
But surprisingly the generated Person class doesn't contain username field!?
When I run tests for comments they fail as expected with:
Caused by: org.hibernate.MappingException: Unable to find column with logical name: username in org.hibernate.mapping.Table(person_db.person) and its related supertables and secondary tables.
