When creating relationships for roo entities using annotations (@OneToMany, @ManyToOne, ...) OR using shell commands, the XXX_Roo_JavaBean.aj file contains the following code :
    declare @field: * MyClass.MyProperty: -@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY);
The "minus" in front of the @ManyToOne generates an error.
Removing it resolves the error.
The correct declaration should be :
    declare @field: * DataSerie.dataset: @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY);
