I have an existing Oracle DB and try the DBRE with Roo Version 1.1.3. It works!
With version 1.1.4 the command 'database reverse engineer --schema ... --includeNonPortableAttributes' creates the domain model but the command
'controller all --package ~.web' only creates the welcome page. The menu.jspx and the Web UI for the entities are missing.
