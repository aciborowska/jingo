Roo's OBR wrapping system at https://roobuild.springsource.org/job/spring-roo-obr-update needs to relax the version ignoring constraints. In particular, it must be legal for a library in Roo's wrapping system to be versioned at release 1.0.0 or 1.1.0. Typically such versions for non-wrapping JARs are ignored by the OBR process as they do not contain metadata of interest to RooBot.
