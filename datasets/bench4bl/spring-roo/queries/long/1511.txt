The generated Scaffold app orders bean fields alphabetically in both the Proxy and the UI. It makes sense for the getters in the proxy to be ordered alphabetically, but the UI should display fields in the order they are declared in the Bean. This also affects the way we choose the primary field for the mobile app.
A fix for this is ready but needs to be merged with the latest Roo changes.
