When running the pizzashop sample (I've switched to this one from the Vote sample for Roo in Action chapter 1) I see that the code generated does not compile.  I've narrowed it down to two problems:
1.  You are using @RooWebJson, and it seems @RooWebScaffold now has an attribute exposeJson = true that seems to do the same thing.
2.  You annotate your entities with @RooJpaEntity, it's now @RooEntity
Can this be cleaned up before the release of Roo 1.2.0 and for the Roo 1.2 milestones?  It seems like some things are refactored but the code hasn't caught up with the shell commands.
Thanks,
Ken
