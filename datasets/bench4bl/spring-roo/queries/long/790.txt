Some small issues reported by PageSpeed/YSlow, which are still in the trunk:

bullet-arrow.png is missing but still referenced in alt.css and standard.css
width and height attributes should be given to the flag icons in language.tagx
some inefficient selectors could be modified, e.g. "li ul li ul" (descendant selector)
