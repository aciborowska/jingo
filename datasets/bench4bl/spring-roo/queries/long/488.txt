Spring Roo generates an incorrect Foo_JavaBean.aj file for entity using inner classes like this:
package com.sample;
public class Foo {
  private Bar f; 
  public static enum Bar 
{ A, B, C }
}
The problem is that Roo will generate an incorrect import of non-existent com.sample.Bar instead of import com.sample.Foo.Bar. 
It doesn't help to declare the field as [ private Foo.Bar f ]. The only workaround is to declare the field with a fully qualified type name like [ private com.sample.Foo.Bar f ].
