The groupId and artifact used for jstl are incorrect and is no longer available to download
Refer to https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/MVNCENTRAL-71 which highlights an issue and that artifact was deleted.
Please upadate the Roo shell to generate the following for the pom.xml file:
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.servlet.jsp.jstl</groupId>
    <artifactId>jstl-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.2</version>
</dependency>
I tried doing this manually, but as soon as I run a Roo command that updated the pom.xml file it reverts my changes.
