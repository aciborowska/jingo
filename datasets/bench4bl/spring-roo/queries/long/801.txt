There must be additional slash for usage of tag "table". Otherwise, there is wrong path for complex path structure.
Example, generated code:






<table:table data="${featuretypes}" path="features/types" ...>




            ...




</table:table>






Links on the list page:
http://localhost:8080/APP /features/features/types/1
http://localhost:8080/APP /features/features/types/1?form
Right tag usage:






<table:table ... path="/features/types" .../>
