Roo 1.1.0.M3 handles resources mappings differently compared to older versions -
instead of urlrewrite it uses <mvc:resources /> tag to map static resources.
One particular line that by default could cause security risk is following, that is automatically added to webmvc-config.xml by roo:






 




<mvc:resources location="classpath:/META-INF/spring/" mapping="/resources/spring/**"/>






Since Roo also places many project specific files to /META-INF/spring/ folder(
applicationContext-jms.xml, applicationContext.xml, applicationContext-security.xml, database.properties, email.properties, ...), they also get handled the same way that static resources (such as Spring.js) and be seen from the web. For example:
http://somehost/rooapp/resources/spring/applicationContext-security.xml
