In Roo 1.1.0.M1 [rev 684]:
If an entity has only one field, an this field has for instance an enum type, than the generated  registerConverters() in the accoding controller yields compiler errors, since the enum cannot be converted to string.
Let's assume we have this entity: 






class Person { GenderEnum gender;}






than, the generated code in the controller will be:






@Override




public String convert(Question question) {




   return person.getGender();




}






This yields compiler error, since person.getGender() is no String.
