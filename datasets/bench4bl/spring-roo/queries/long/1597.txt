When I run expenses.roo and run the result with mvn gwt:run, validation checks fail. Stepping through the GWT code, this throws an exception in JsonRequestProcessor:
      ValidatorFactory validatorFactory = Validation.buildDefaultValidatorFactory();
which in the past has meant that no validation jars were on the classpath. And though I'm pretty sure I've seen that line fail in the debugger, I'm not seeing the warning message we log in that case. Is the logging config screwed up too?
