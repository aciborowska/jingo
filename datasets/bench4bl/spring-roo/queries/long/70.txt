wedding.roo was included in 1.0.0.M1 to coincide with the blog published at http://blog.springsource.com/2009/05/27/roo-part-2.
The blog showed how to set a non-default path for the Hypersonic database files, using the following Roo command:
roo> database set -key database.url -value jdbc:hsqldb:/home/balex/our-wedding
While a person following the blog would change the path to an appropriate location for their machine, those wishing to use the wedding.roo script would instead encounter an error when they tried to run the application (as a /home/balex directory) is unlikely to exist on their machine.
We should use an alternate path in the wedding.roo script that is more likely to work on their computer, such as "$
{user.home}
/our-wedding".
