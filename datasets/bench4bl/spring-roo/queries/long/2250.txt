Right now when I create an Entity with a field reference that can be null, ROO scaffolds a select box that automatically chooses an item.
So you can not create an item with a null field.
This is bad because I either need 1 of 2 fields picked and there is no way not to pick either because they are both selects.
Solution, if @NotNull is not present, create an input field
OR (Better)
Create a select box where the first item is  – Select – with an empty value.
