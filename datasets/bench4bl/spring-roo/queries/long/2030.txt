To use some of the fixes made for 1.1.2 I grabbed the code from git, 1.1.2 rev 91ece7d
The project that worked fine with ROO 1.1.2 now says when Roo starts up:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The entire package name must be lowercase (received 'org.apache.sanselan.common.byteSources')
Problem is, the package name IS mixed case, so this requirement seems weird. What's going on?
(reference to the package name: http://commons.apache.org/sanselan/api-release/org/apache/sanselan/common/byteSources/package-summary.html )
