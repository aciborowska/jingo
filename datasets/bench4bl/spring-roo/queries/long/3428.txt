I have following class:






@RooJavaBean




public class FieldBean {




  private transient RegistrationService registrationService;




  private final String userName;




}






and in generated ITD I have getters and setters for private fields.
In roo.1.2.1 - @RooJavaBean annotation excludes getters and setters for transient and final fields.
