[Engineering Build]
The Roo project Template for Addons does not create a valid plugin anymore. I guess that is the case since ROO-728.
Besides the fact that the plugin cannot be compiled (since the roo-bootstrap dependency used in the addon tempalte so far seems not to inlcude the other Roo dependencies transitively anymore) there are IMHO some other issues with the tempalte, for example missing OSGI manfifest genreation.
