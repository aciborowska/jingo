Roo-generated apps appear to serve up blank pages until a selenium test is created.
This behaviour is consistent across the three examples.
Vote and clinic simply show white, blank pages, no error. Wedding's pages are visible, but that does include selenium test creation on the script.
I've attached a zip file with the state the working dir. was in after it's initial run through. Roo's output is in roo.log
Let me know if you'd like more details. (I'll be watching this issue)
