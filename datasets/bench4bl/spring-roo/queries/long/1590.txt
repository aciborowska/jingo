I'm trying to reverse engineer an Oracle database with Roo.
I am able to instrospect the database without error, and the results look correct.
When I reverse engineer the database, it creates the files then undoes the create. Below is what is sent to the screen (abbreviated to fit within a post), but I'm not sure how to turn on any debugging to get more meaningful information.
Code:






roo> database reverse engineer --package ~.db --sCreated org.neoninc.db.TypeType




Managed ROOT\.roo-dbre                               Created org.neoninc.db.Unit




Created SRC_MAIN_JAVA\org\neoninc\db             Created org.neoninc.db.UnitTrsl




Created SRC_MAIN_JAVA\org\neoninc\db\Attr.java   Created 




 




....




 




Created SRC_MAIN_JAVA\org\neoninc\db\Samp_Roo_Entity.aj




Undo create SRC_MAIN_JAVA\org\neoninc\db\Samp_Roo_Entity.aj




 




....




 




Undo manage ROOT\.roo-dbre




Field 'samps4' already defined in ITD (ITD target 'org.neoninc.db.Samp_Roo_DbMan
