All (http://spring-roo-addons.googlecode.com/svn/repo/repository.xml) Addons have disappeared (being removed?) from the RooBot registry:http://spring-roo-repository.springsource.org/roobot/roobot.xml
The (re)registration attempts following the instructions (http://static.springsource.org/spring-roo/reference/html/simple-addons.html#d4e3384) lead to nothing. I have not "received a response from RooBot indicating that the processing of your repository has started" nor I can find related trace in the roobot-log: http://spring-roo-repository.springsource.org/roobot/roobot-log.txt
