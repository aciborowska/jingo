Upon using the 'field embedded' command, I ran into the following error/warning: "The field embedded command is only applicable to JPA @Entity target types". I've checked my classes and the target type had the @RooEntity annotation, so I guess this should work. I've temporarily replaced that annotation with the @Entity annotation, performend the same 'field embedded' command without any problems. Changing the annotation then again back to '@RooEntity' worked fine and even the unit tests kept working, so not much of a problem, but still a bit of a strange annoyance.
