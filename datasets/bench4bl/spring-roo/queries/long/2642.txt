I'm using Spring roo 1.1.5 with Spring MVC. My problem is, that the items in my dropdown lists are to long. There're displayed all values of the entity which is not what I want. See attached screen shots for more information. "roo.png" shows the dropdown list, "roo2.png" the plain view. 
If I run e.g. the petclinic sample I can't reproduce this issue - everything looks fine.
