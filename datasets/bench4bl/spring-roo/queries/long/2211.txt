When an entity field is flagged as a OneToMany/ManyToOne relation, the Roo generated code *_Roo_GAE.aj indiscriminately tags the .id with @Extension(vendorName="datanucleus", key="gae.encoded-pk", value="true").  This can be problematic because the default entity id type is Long and it cannot be assigned the "gae.encoded-pk" extension:
"...A field with the "gae.encoded-pk" extension can only be applied to a String primary key..."
The _Roo_GAE code should be adjusted to make sure the .id field is a String.
A second problem related to the same issue is that when you manually define the entity's .id as a String, this breaks the *_Roo_JavaBean.aj code that expects Long id's to set/get the related HashSets...
