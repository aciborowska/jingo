Build any of the samples with WebMVC. Look at web.xml. The CharacterEncodingFilter is ordered after several other filters, one or more of which retrieve a parameter from the request. Character encoding can only be changed before the first parameter request, therefore the CharacterEncodingFilter is having no effect, and the result is a mangled UTF-8 character interpreted as ISO=8859-1 (you should be able to test this yourself, by using something like the specialized quotes in Microsoft word). The fix is to make the CharacterEncodingFilter the first filter executed.
For additional encoding info see: http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/FAQ/CharacterEncoding
