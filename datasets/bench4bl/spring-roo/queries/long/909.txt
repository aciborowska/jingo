I have a One-To-Many relationship in my domain model: 
An entity Post has many Categories.
So, in the  create.jspx and update.jspx for Post, a select tag with multiple=true is generated for the property category.
I can select multiple categories and sucessfully persist a Post with Multiple categories.
But, when I try to edit the Post  (i.e. use update.jspx), there is always only one Category selected in the select box, even the Post has multiple Categories.
I looked into the html in the Browser, and that seems okay, since multiple opetion tages have "selected=true" there.
Then I removed the the following  DOJO decoration in select.tagx, and then it worked:
<script type="text/javascript">Spring.addDecoration(new Spring.ElementDecoration({elementId : '_$
{field}
_id', widgetType: 'dijit.form.MultiSelect', widgetAttrs : {}})); </script>
