Same issue as ROO-2095, which I should have reopened, but I don't know how to do that...
Issue was closed because the problem could not be reproduced. I do not have this problem on windows vista 32 bits, but on windows 7 64bits I need to mount an ubuntu through vmware and than mount to my working-directory to be able to run roo there. I presume its the 64-bits.
