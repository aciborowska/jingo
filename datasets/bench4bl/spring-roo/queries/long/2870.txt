I tried to add supplier column to ProductBean init method in order to show the relation in list view.
In the list request I got the following error:






GRAVE: org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: failed to lazily initialize a collection of role: com.springsource.bikeshop.domain.Supplier.products, no session or session was closed






Is a bit odd since in web.xml is declared the OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter.
