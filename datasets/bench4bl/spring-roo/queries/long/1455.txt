This is an API change. Bob, Ray, and I discussed and agreed on it today.
The WriteOperation should contain only two values: UPDATE and DELETE. UPDATE encompasses UPDATE, CREATE, and ACQUIRE. Fix the firing of events, to before Bob's patch. Fix the wire format so that WriteOperation.CREATE does not have to be sent. The presence of isFuture flag is the signal to differentiate between CREATE and UPDATE on the client and server side.
