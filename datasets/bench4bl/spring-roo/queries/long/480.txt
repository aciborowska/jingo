I created a very simple Roo project with one entity with 5 properties.
In Roo RC 3, everything looked quite fine. In Roo RC 4 the layout of the webpage seems to be completly broken. The labels for the text fields are not shown, and the text fields wrap around the menu.
In Firefox, there are similar issues with the layout, but only when JavaScript is turned off (using NoScript plugin). Note: With Roo RC3, the layout was okay even with JavaScript turned off.
