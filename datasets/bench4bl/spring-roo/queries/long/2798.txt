To replicate:

Run the vote.roo script
Quit the Roo shell
Push in the "getChoiceToStringConverter" method from ApplicationConversionServiceFactoryBean_Roo_ConversionService.aj
Upon restarting the Roo shell, the above ITD's installLabelConverters method now looks like this (i.e. the Converter<Choice, String> returned by the pushed-in method is no longer being registered):







public void ApplicationConversionServiceFactoryBean.installLabelConverters(FormatterRegistry registry) {




    registry.addConverter(getIdToChoiceConverter());




    registry.addConverter(getStringToChoiceConverter());




    registry.addConverter(getVoteToStringConverter());




    registry.addConverter(getIdToVoteConverter());




    registry.addConverter(getStringToVoteConverter());




}






The effect at runtime is that Choice#toString() is called instead of the converter being used. You can see this in the "Create new Vote" screen, in the drop-down of Choice instances.
