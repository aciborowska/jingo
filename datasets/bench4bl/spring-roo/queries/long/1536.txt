The order of the foreign keys in the .roo-dbre xml file should not affect the generation of @ManyToOne and @OneToOne fields. This is due to finding foreign keys based on the table's column names and stopping on the first match of a column instead of simply iterating through the foreign keys themselves and obtaining the local column from the foreign key's reference elements.
