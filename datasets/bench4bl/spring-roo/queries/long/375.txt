Bug ROO-364 has been fixed per my request as of build 415.  However the fix only worked for a brand new project.  I have an existing project with custom path controllers(data/...), and when I ran the latest roo build (419) on it, I get the error message:
[timerFactory] Illegal name 'data/site' (illegal character)
