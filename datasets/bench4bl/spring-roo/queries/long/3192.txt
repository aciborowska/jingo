If the .java file has an import that contains .* it will be rewritten anytime a new finder is added to that .java. 
For example, 
java.utiil.* -> java.*
javax.persistence.* -> javax.*
Attached is a simple log file that contains a very simple program, run it and then add:
import java.utiil.*;
import javax.persistence.*;
to the ChangingImports.java file
Once the new imports have been added run the command:
finder add findChangingImportsesByMessageEquals
and watch the imports change.
This can cause issues and has caused issues when many of the commands believe that they have lost their imports.
