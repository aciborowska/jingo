I'm trying to maintain one-to-many ,many-to-one relations on entities in my project. I'm getting compilation error after "gwt setup" . 
and my code is:
Class1:
@Entity
@RooJavaBean
@RooToString
@RooEntity
public class ClassA {
    private String name;
    @ManyToOne(targetEntity = ClassB.class, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "classB_id")
    private ClassB classB;
}
Class2:
@Entity
@RooJavaBean
@RooToString
@RooEntity
public class ClassB {
    private String name;
}
Class 3:
@Entity
@RooJavaBean
@RooToString
@RooEntity
public class ClassC {
    private String name;
@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private Set<ClassB> classB = new java.util.HashSet<ClassB>();
}
I'm a novice to this and thus unable to proceed forward..
2)I actually have a very big structure (with x,y,z attributes)which i wanted to delegate in another class and thus maintain (persist) only a few attributes (x,y) of the big structure.I wanted to do it in such a way that i can extend my support for other attributes (z) in futher. Any suggestions of how i can achieve it.
