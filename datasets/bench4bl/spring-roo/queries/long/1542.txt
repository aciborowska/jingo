After running the 'gwt setup' command from the roo shell [I am currently using 1.1.0RC1] there a number of classes in the com.google.gwt.requestfactory.shared, com.google.gwt.event.shared, com.google.gwt.place.shared packages (there are more) that can not be resolved in the roo gwt generated classes.
Thanks,
Ojior
