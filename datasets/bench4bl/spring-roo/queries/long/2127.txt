Affected are panel headlines and button labels. All special diacritical characters (like üěščř) are escaped there. 
For example in official German and Swedish localization is affected reset button in Spring Security login page. I have attached project including Czech, German and Swedish localization. These languages has problem with texts in login page.
The problem is use of fn:escapeXml() function and <spring:escapeBody/> tag.
Similar problem is described here https://jira.springsource.org/browse/ROO-1951?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%253Aworklog-tabpanel
and here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LANG-66
But it's not solved in actual 1.1.2 snapshot as first link says.
