I have a domain object called country_master with the fields defined as (excluding ID field etc.): 
    @NotNull
    @Column(name = "COUNTRY_NAME")
    private String name;
    @NotNull
    @Column(name = "COUNTRY_ISO_CODE")
    private String ISOCODE;
When I generate the view using ROO scaffolding, the generated view viz. show.jspx has the ISOCODE field generated as: 
<div class="box" id="_iSOCODE">$
{country.iSOCODE}
</div> 
instead of 
<div class="box" id="_iSOCODE">$
{country.ISOCODE}
</div>
This field's usage was incorrectly generated in all the view related JSPs such as create.jspx, list.jspx etc.
