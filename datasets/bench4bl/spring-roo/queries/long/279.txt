This can easily be seen on the PetClinic demo.  Run up the demo from scratch and attempt to add a new Visit.  The only fields displayed on the form are Description and Visit Date.  The Pet being seen and the Vet attending are also required, but since there are none in the system, nothing appears on the from. 
The easiest solution would be to display a message instead of the form specifying that required data is missing - in this case, that a Pet and a Vet must have been added to the system first.
