I am using Spring Roo 1.2.5.RELEASE on OS X 10.9.2 and java version 1.8.0_05.
I generated a project and added an entity with automatically generated integration tests. After triggering a "perform tests" the compile goal failed (complete log file attached):

[ERROR] The type java.lang.CharSequence cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files
[ERROR] java.util.Arrays cannot be resolved to a type
[ERROR] The type java.util.Map$Entry cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files
Changing the aspectj.version property in the pom.xml from 1.7.4 to 1.8.0 resolved the issue.
