Although user_id field in "comment" table is specified as NOT NULL,
the generated Comment class has:
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "user_id", referencedColumnName = "id")
private Person Comment.person;
In other words NOT NULL on FK is not added as field annotation.
The consequence is failed integration test:
ERROR org.hibernate.util.JDBCExceptionReporter - Column 'user_id' cannot be null
Also I manually add @NotNull in CommentDbManaged.aj, that doesn't help, since TestDataOnDemand would not be changed automatically.
