When building a web flow with a given name, such as registerAttendees:
install web flow -flowName registerAttendees
When the UI generates the "Enter the registerAttendeesFlow" link on the navigation bar, it lowercases the URL.  The URL becomes:
/registerattendees
  This creates a flow not found situation; the flow is properly configured with the camel case name.  The correct flow URi is:
/registerAttendees
