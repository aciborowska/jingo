AbstractItdMetadataProvider fails to consider if the governor's type metadata was returned as non-null but was invalid. The change should be:






-               if (governorPhysicalTypeMetadata == null) {




+               if (governorPhysicalTypeMetadata == null || !governorPhysicalTypeMetadata.isValid()) {
