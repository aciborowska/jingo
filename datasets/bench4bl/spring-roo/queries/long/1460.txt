I have a problem with saving form with multiple checkboxes on it.I have following entity with 2 Boolean fields
public class UserAccount extends Logger {
    ....
    @NotNull
    private Boolean enabled = true;
   ....
    @NotNull
    private Boolean receiveAlertMessages;
}
In first place there was only 'enabled' field and everything worked fine, than I added 'receiveAlertMessages' field (field boolean --fieldName receiveAlertMessages --notNull). After additional field creation checkboxes doesn't work properly together(ui part not show correct boolean values). When I remove Spring.addDecoration script from form:checkbox tag everything seem to work perfectly.
