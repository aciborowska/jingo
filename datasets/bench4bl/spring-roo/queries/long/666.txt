It it currently not possible to define entities whose names contain the reserved word "Test"
roo> 
entity --class ~.model.TestCase
Entity name rejected as conflicts with test execution defaults; please remove 'Test' and/or 'TestCase' 
This is even true if reserved words are explicitly allowed:
~.TestCase roo> entity --class ~.TestCase --permitReservedWords
Entity name rejected as conflicts with test execution defaults; please remove 'Test' and/or 'TestCase'
