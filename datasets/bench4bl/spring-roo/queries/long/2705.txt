In some places, such as ServiceInterfaceMetadata, ServiceClassMetadata and JpaEntityMetadata, no check to determine if the member found, when checking to see if a member already exists, was declared by the the producing metadata item. Generally if the member was declared by the producing metadata then the behaviour is different, see EntityMetadata.
