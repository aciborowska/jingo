STS is showing compilation errors in load-scripts.tagx
javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter cannot be resolved to a type	
JspContext cannot be resolved to a type	                        
JspException cannot be resolved to a type
pageContext cannot be resolved
SkipPageException cannot be resolved to a type
Rather confusing as: 
		<dependency>
			<groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
			<artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId>
			<version>2.5</version>
			<scope>provided</scope>
		</dependency>
Is clearly specified in the projects pom.
