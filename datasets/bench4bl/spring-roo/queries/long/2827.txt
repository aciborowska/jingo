I was attempting to follow the tutorial at http://static.springsource.org/spring-roo/reference/html/beginning.html and incorporating the MongoDB as per http://static.springsource.org/spring-roo/reference/html/base-layers.html instead of a JPA source. There is not a 'jpa setup --provider' parameter to specify MongoDB, nor does invoking 'mongo setup' satisfy Roo's requirements, so it keeps prompting to call 'jpa setup'.
