If the Java class uses the generic wildcard syntax anywhere, then Roo's Java parser fails. As a consequence, all Roo-managed ITDs for that class are deleted.
Example:
@RooToString
@RooJavaBean
public class Generic 
{

  private List<Object> list;

}

works as expected, whereas 
@RooToString
@RooJavaBean
public class Generic 
{

  private List<?> list;

}

fails. The wildcard may occur anywhere in the Java file, not only in the field declaration, e.g. the method public Class<?> getType() fails as well.
