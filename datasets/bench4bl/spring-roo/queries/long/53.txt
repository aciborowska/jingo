Running through Ben's wedding example I noticed that the Selenium test will use a generated date that uses MM/dd/yyyy as the format, but the generated controller actually doesn't allow that as it expects yyyy-MM-dd when using a Dutch locale. This makes the test fail with a timeout, as the clickAndWait for saving the new Rsvp never progresses. 
The generated HTML currently has this Spring-JS snippet:
  <script type="text/javascript">Spring.addDecoration(new Spring.ElementDecoration({elementId : "_confirmed", widgetType : "dijit.form.DateTextBox", widgetAttrs : {datePattern : "MM/dd/yyyy", required : false}})); </script>
However, the widget will still output yyyy-MM-dd format and won't accept anything else.
The root cause seems to be http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SWF-844 which also has a solution/workaround to this issue.
