I need to change the display of a bean that shows up in a selection list (I think this is a common use case, so perhaps I am missing something about configuring ROO, but in either case, I think this is a bug). After much looking, I found the functionality in TaxonomyController_Roo_Controller.aj. The relevant parts are the autowired field TaxonomyController.conversionService, getTaxonomyConverter(), and registerConverters(). 
I figured I could just create a getTaxonomyConverter in TaxonomyController.java. Doing this properly removed getTaxonomyConverter from the .aj file, but it also removed registerConverters(), but not TaxonomyController.conversionService. 
So I figured I would just recreate registerConverters() in TaxonomyController.java, but I got an error when I did. That was caused by TaxonomyController.conversionService is a private member (I cannot access it from TaxonomyController.java). I then attempted to create my own TaxonomyController.conversionService in TaxonomyController.java, which also failed as Roo did not remove TaxonomyController.conversionService from the .aj file.
I think it is fair to say that if the developer overrides the getTaxonomyConverter method, they would like it to still be a registered converter. Therefore, I would suggest this is solved by keeping registerConverters around unless it is directly overridden itself. If registerConverters is overridden, then the conversionService field should be removed at the same time.
