On select field tag:






src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/tags/form/fields/select.tagx






1.- In two places, when disabled form binding:






<c:when test="${disableFormBinding}">




<select id="_${sec_field}_id" name="${sec_field}" multiple="${multiple}">






Whatever the value, the select is always multiple. When the attribute is informed with any value, the this specifies that multiple options can be selected.
There is no a standard, but usually is not defined when single selection and defined with multiple="multiple" when multiple selection.
2.- There is no possibility to mark an option as selected when disabled form binding.
Possible solutions:

Provide the value that should be selected as another tag attribute
Provide the name of a model attribute setted on the controller that should be selected as another tag attribute
