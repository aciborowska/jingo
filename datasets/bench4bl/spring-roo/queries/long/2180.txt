Between 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 , the ProjectOperations.dependencyUpdate operation has been removed.
This breaks the API for third party addons.
According to "usual" OSGI package versioning schemes,  the major version of the package should have been increased and not only the third number.
Please also note that commands like "addon info" claim, that addons are compliant with Roo version "1.1".  This makes it even more critical to break API within the sub releases of 1.1, since the end user is not aware of this and will just notice that the addons "don't work".
