As it stands, a list page with an empty list will display "No X found for this id", which isn't quite right (since no id has been requested). Here's the code in list.tagx that generates the message:






list.tagx






<spring:message arguments="${label}" code="entity.not.found.single"/>






The code "entity.not.found.single" should probably be changed to "entity.not.found".
