Web Scaffold: missing 'null' value in ONE_TO_ONE drop-down
When I create an entity which references another in a one-to-one-or-zero mapping (a one-to-one without a not-null constraint), eg. a Task, which has an optional owner, I cannot create a new Task with an undefined owner.
Steps to reproduce:
Execute the following code in Roo:-
project --topLevelPackage com.example.test 
persistence setup --provider HIBERNATE --database HYPERSONIC_IN_MEMORY
entity --class ~.entities.Person
field string name --notNull --sizeMax 30
entity --class ~.entities.Task
field string description --notNull --sizeMax 500
field reference --fieldName owner --type ~.entities.Person --cardinality ONE_TO_ONE
controller all --package ~.web
[end Roo]
Launch Tomcat with: mvn tomcat:run
Point browser to http://localhost:8080/test - First create a Task. Now create a Person. Now go to create a second task - you have to assign it to a Person.
Expected behaviour:
This behaviour is fine if the owner had been declared with --notNull
The generated drop-down should have an entry at the top of its list for null/none/unassigned.
