I created an abstract "base" entity with "id" and "version" fields. When I try to create new entity in Roo that extends this base entity, I get:

Created SRC_MAIN_JAVA\com\abstracttest\domain\Person.java
Undo create SRC_MAIN_JAVA\com\abstracttest\domain\Person.java
User provided @javax.persistence.Id field but failed to provide a public 'getId()' method in 'com.abstracttest.domain.Person'
roo>
...and Roo will not create the new entity.
See forum for script and steps to reproduce.
