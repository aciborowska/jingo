A bug in JLine 1.0 causes Roo to beep on each key press after an alert scenario is reached, such as a command not being able to be auto-completed. To replicate type "script jim" then press tab, each subsequent key press will result in an alert tone being produced. A pull request has been submitted here but in the interim, i.e. until a new JLine is released, we can published a modified version of JLine which contains the fix.
