If you log in, then log out, then log in again, the wrong view is shown. Here's how to replicate this problem:
1. Run this script:






project --topLevelPackage oops




persistence setup --provider HIBERNATE --database HYPERSONIC_IN_MEMORY 




entity --class ~.Thing 




controller all --package ~.web




security setup






2. Exit Roo.
3. Change the intercept URLs in applicationContext-security.xml to read:






<intercept-url pattern="/thing/**" access="hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')"/>




<intercept-url pattern="/resources/**" access="permitAll" />




<intercept-url pattern="/static/**" access="permitAll" />




<intercept-url pattern="/**" access="permitAll" />






4. Do a mvn jetty:run
5. Click the "List all Things" link; you will be prompted to log in.
6. Log in as admin/admin; the requested list appears.
7. Click the "Logout" link; the home page appears.
8. Click the "List all Things" link again; you will again be prompted to log in (everything up to this point is as you'd expect).
9. Log in as admin/admin and note that instead of seeing the "List all Things" view as you did in step 6, you see either:

the login page again (on Firefox), or
a blank page (on IE 7 or 8).

In either case, you are now logged in and can navigate to any secured URLs without seeing the login page again.
