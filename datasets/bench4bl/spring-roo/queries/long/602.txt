I just did a 'security setup' in a Roo 1.0.1 app and accessed the login page: the text there contains a literal <br/> because the resource bundle contents is escaped by default. Either messages like this should be split up in two messages so the generated page can include the <br/> itself, or the generated tags should allow for non-escaped output where required. See the attached screenshot for the English version of this page.
