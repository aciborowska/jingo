This problem was reported by Adrian Colyer in ROO-138.
Essentially we have changed the initial project generation to start without any Web artifacts (see ROO-26). This allows users to create a simple Spring project without any persistence or Web artefacts.
However, the project maven pom file still refers to packaging type 'war' which causes 'mvn package' to fail due to a missing web.xml which is expected in Web projects.
