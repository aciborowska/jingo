Currently section 10.2 of the documentation states that you can add a "public Converter<MyEntity, String> getMyEntityConverter()" method to the ApplicationConversionServiceFactoryBean that's annotated with @RooConversionService to override the default converter implementation. However, that seems to be wrong: adding a getter method doesn't work, you have to define a static inner class MyEntityConverter instead. The documentation needs to be fixed to be consistent with the implementation.
