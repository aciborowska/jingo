Root Bot does not publish the add ons that used to work previously. I don't know why but may it is because the quantity of add ons published at http://spring-roo-repository.springsource.org/roobot/roobot.xml is very less. One of the addons gvinx can't be installed using the roo bot via the roo shell. 
Is there a problem with the roo bot?
