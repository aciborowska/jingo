May be an STS issue...  
In a new workspace I can create a new project using the "Spring Template Project - Roo Web App (based on Roo 1.0.0.RC2) and then it asks about the download and it properly creates a new project once the download has been completed.  However, if I try to create another new project using the same template, it pops up an "Error:  Unexpected Exception" window.
