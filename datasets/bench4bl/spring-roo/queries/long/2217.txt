It appears the script declaration in microblogging.tagx file where the Twitter widget is loaded does not render correctly:






<script src="http://widgets.twimg.com/j/2/widget.js"></script>






The rendered end script tag, "</script>" does not appear to be working and the next script declaration where the widget is displayed is not interpreted as a script declaration.
