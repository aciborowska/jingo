When using a RestTemplate to call Json Controllers built as per Roo's documentation, the code
return new ResponseEntity<String>(HttpStatus.CREATED)
is insufficient, because without a content-type HttpResponseExtractorConverter will throw RestClientException.  This behaviour is mentioned in the open issue SPR-7908 also.
Current workaround is to return the following:
HttpHeaders headers= new HttpHeaders();
headers.add("Content-Type", "application/text");
return new ResponseEntity<String>(headers, HttpStatus.CREATED);
