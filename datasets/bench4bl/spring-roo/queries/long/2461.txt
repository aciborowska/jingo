The release script "roo-deploy.sh" contains two occurrences of this line, which works on Linux but fails with "keyword not found" errors on OSX:






MVN_TOMCAT_PID=`ps -eo "%p %c %a" | grep Launcher | grep tomcat:run | cut -b "1-6" | sed "s/ //g"`






The workaround for OSX is to delete the -o switch and its format string, like this:






MVN_TOMCAT_PID=`ps -e | grep Launcher | grep tomcat:run | cut -b "1-6" | sed "s/ //g"`






Ideally we would like the script to work on both OSX and Linux.
