There are two critical errors in roo-dev.bat for working with addons:

The 'not' in this line shouldn't be there:
  if not "%ROO_ADDON_CLASSPATH_FILE%" == "" goto run
because the generated setup.bat uses double quotes around the path to roo_classpath.txt it's considered as a string by the for statement, not as a filename: you need to add the option 'usebackq'

I've fixed these two issues, added 'usebackq' to the other for-loop as well for safety (user might use double quotes in his %ROO_CLASSPATH_FILE%) and used backslashes instead of forward slashes for paths: the latter isn't strictly necessary, but the resulting paths that contain both backslashed and forward slashes otherwise are simply too ugly to let be
