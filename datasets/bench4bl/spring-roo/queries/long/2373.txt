Issue related to ROO-2362 and ROO-2368. Pushed in methods to not cause the json ITD to update (ie to remove it's own) for 2 reasons:
1) the method searchs only for method name and does not include the parameter types, and
2) the member details of the form backing object were incorrectly being searched when it should have been the member details of the controller
