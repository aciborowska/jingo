Currently addon-web-mvc-controller is using an artifact ID of org.springframework.roo.addon.web.controller. This is inconsistent with its top-level package, which is org.springframework.roo.addon.web.mvc.controller. This will create issues as we modify maven-bundle-plugin to include entries under the artifact ID package only. Also it is inconsistent with convention used with other Roo modules. It's a simple change, but developers will need to eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse and re-import all the projects into STS.
