I've downloaded the 1.0.0.RC4 and started a new project and typed the following commands:
hint
persistence setup --database HYPERSONIC_IN_MEMORY --provider HIBERNATE
hint
The hint displayed for entites refers to a "-name" argument, but that was renamed to "-class" in RC4. Also, the word "After" is mispelled.
No big deal, but it won't hurt to fix. 
The wrong sentences are:
Enter the --name in the form '~.domain.MyEntityClassName'
Afer specify a --name argument
