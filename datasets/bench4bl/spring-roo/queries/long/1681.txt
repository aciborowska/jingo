The script command does not seem to work properly on Windows 7 (Pro 64). It works fine on my Windows XP (Pro 32) 
I tried a relative path:
roo> script --file ../myScript.roo
got:
Resource 'C:\springsource\roo-1.1.0.RELEASE\..\myScript.roo' not found on disk or in classpath
( C:\springsource\roo-1.1.0.RELEASE is ROO installation directory in my machine )
Using the absolute path does not work either, (note: no white space in the script file path):
roo> script --file C:\Dev\Workspace2\RooScripts\myScript.roo
got:
Resource 'C:\springsource\roo-1.1.0.RELEASE\C:\Dev\Workspace2\RooScripts\myScript.roo' not found on disk or in classpath
Basically, it appends the file argument after <ROO_HOME>\
I tried running ROO shell both inside STS 2.5.0.REALEASE and on command line. Same result.
I also tried stand alone ROO 1.1.0.RELEASE and STS 2.5.0.RELEASE (both 32 and 64 bits versions). No difference.
The work around for me is copying the script file to the ROO installation directory
