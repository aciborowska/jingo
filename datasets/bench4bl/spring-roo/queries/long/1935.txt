I'm trying to use DBRE against an Oracle database with Roo 1.1.0-RELEASE with no success so far.






roo> database reverse engineer 




No remote OBR repositories have matching add-ons matching your request




JDBC driver not available for 'oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver'






I looked around in the internet and found a suggestion to run the following:






roo> script --file install-jdbc-drivers.roo






But that fails when trying to download the oracle driver:






java.io.FileNotFoundException: 




http://repository.springsource.com/maven/bundles/external/com/oracle/jdbc/com.springsource.oracle.jdbc/10.2.0.2/com.springsource.oracle.jdbc-10.2.0.2.jar






I'm attaching the Roo log and console output.
