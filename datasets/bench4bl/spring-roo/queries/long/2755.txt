The "web gwt all" command requires 2 parameters: proxy & request package locations.  If the developer chooses to put them in the top level package ie ~.proxy and ~.request the compiler will complain that it cannot find the source for these files.  Roo could add a line in ApplicationScaffold.gwt.xml <source path="request"/> and <source path="proxy"/>
