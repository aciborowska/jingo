I created a Roo project, and then deployed it to a tc Server instance in WTP (but I believe any Tomcat with LTW enabled would give the same results). When the application is deployed, the following errors are produced by aspectj:
[TomcatAspectJWeavingClassLoader@39b1ff47] error aspect 'com.springsource.ccoach.domain.Coach_Roo_ToString' woven into 'com.springsource.ccoach.domain.Coach' must be defined to the weaver (placed on the aspectpath, or defined in an aop.xml file if using LTW).
[TomcatAspectJWeavingClassLoader@39b1ff47] error aspect 'com.springsource.ccoach.domain.Coach_Roo_JavaBean' woven into 'com.springsource.ccoach.domain.Coach' must be defined to the weaver (placed on the aspectpath, or defined in an aop.xml file if using LTW).
[TomcatAspectJWeavingClassLoader@39b1ff47] error aspect 'com.springsource.ccoach.domain.Coach_Roo_Configurable' woven into 'com.springsource.ccoach.domain.Coach' must be defined to the weaver (placed on the aspectpath, or defined in an aop.xml file if using LTW).
[TomcatAspectJWeavingClassLoader@39b1ff47] error aspect 'com.springsource.ccoach.domain.Coach_Roo_Entity' woven into 'com.springsource.ccoach.domain.Coach' must be defined to the weaver (placed on the aspectpath, or defined in an aop.xml file if using LTW).
Roo should generate and maintain an  aop.xml file for the aspects that it creates, so that Roo projects can be used in LTW environments without error.
