Run the application and go to http://localhost/vote
The home page fails to load, with this error in the server log:






No message found under code 'menu_category_flows_label' for locale 'en'.







If you add this code to application.properties and restart the application, another message code is reported as missing:






No message found under code 'menu_item_sampleflow_label' for locale 'en'.






And if you fix that, you get:






No message found under code 'Sampleflow' for locale 'en'.
