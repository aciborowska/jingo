When running a roo build application on jetty by calling "mvn jetty:run" the applicaion is running directly under "http://localhost:8080" instead of running under "http://localhost:8080/applicationname". This should be changed to be in line with Tomcat and TC-Server where applications run under "http://localhost:8080/applicationname".
Furthermore this leads to some problems with generated selenium tests as those are based on URLs including the application name.
