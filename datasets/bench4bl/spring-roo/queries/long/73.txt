If a package contains the package definition file package-info.java, the Roo shell produces the following error message:
> The first letter of the type name portion must be uppercase (attempted '<packagename>.package-info')
This seems to be a cosmetic issue only because Roo parses and generates code for all other files in the package as expected.
