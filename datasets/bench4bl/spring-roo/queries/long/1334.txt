Roo will not run properly under jdk5. The documentation refers to jdk5 so support seem to have been in place. Either Roo could possibly be made at release to support running under jdk5 if that's what the developers want or the documentation could reflect the actual situation. 
Some history on why it was dropped would be nice too.
