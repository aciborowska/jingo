To reproduce run roo-dev script clinic.roo in one shell and leave it running, then remove version field in Visit.java by setting versionField="" via an external editor (another shell for instance). This leads to the inclusion of the non existing getVersion() method produced by ConversionServiceMetadata. Saving Visit.java a second time (ie touch) corrects the inconsistencies and also updates update.jspx (see ROO-1954).
ConversionServiceMetadataProviderImpl registers for update notifications for both BeanInfoMetadata and EntityMetadata for the Visit type in lines 116 and 117 respectively.
ConversionServiceMetadata explicitly excludes version fields in line 162 - 165. However, debugging reveals that BeanInfoMetadata still reports that the getVersion() method is still present when it is not (EntityMetadata on the other hand correctly reports that getVersion() has been removed). This leads to the inconsistency seen here.
