As part of running "gwt setup" all types are re-requested to ensure that the gwt-addon has a chance to react to the types in the system. To make sure a notify is performed and a cached type isn't returned the requested type needs to be explicitly evicted from the cache when retrieving it. This explicit eviction isn't currently being performed.
