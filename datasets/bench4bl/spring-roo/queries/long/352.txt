There's an error in the latest roo.bat: the environment variable for the work dir isn't closed properly since its percentage sign is misplaced. The correct line should be this:
java -Djline.nobell=true -Djava.ext.dirs="%ROO_HOME%/dist;%ROO_HOME%/lib;%ROO_HOME%/work" %ROO_OPTS% -Droo.home="%ROO_HOME%" org.springframework.roo.bootstrap.Bootstrap "classpath:/roo-bootstrap.xml" %*
