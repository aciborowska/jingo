Was following along with the ten-minutes example but doing it from the STS Roo shell.
When creating a field for an entity, if you type this to see what your options are: 
  field string myField --<CTRL-SPACE>
Roo just places a double quote on the command line and does not display any options, if you repeat it will do it a second time like this:
  field string myField --""
If you use the --fieldName option instead (the ten-minute example does not on page 9), then it works ok displaying the --notNull, etc.. options that are available.
So this works ok: 
  field string --fieldName myField --<CTRL-SPACE>
