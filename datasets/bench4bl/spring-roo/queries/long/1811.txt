I found a bug while trying to submit a form with error, my editor field had his content delete ( the dojo rich edit field has been replaced by a text area)
I check in firebug and found a "spring roo richText should not be used with the TEXTAREA tag. See dijit._editor.RichText docs"
I solved the problem by modifying in the editor.tagx file <form:textarea 
by 
<div dojoType="dijit.Editor"
is it possible to make this change for the 1.1.1 Release ?
