I have created a file upload functionality in create.jspx as shown
<form:create id="maps" modelAttribute="maps" multipart="true" path="/maps" render="$
{empty dependencies}
" z="user-managed">
<field:input disableFormBinding="true" field="map" id="map" type="file" z="user-managed"/>
in my create mode , it works fine. 
But , after modifying update.jspx accordingly , i get a persistence error.
When i debugged it in STS , i observed that , after clicking on update, the control moves on to the create function in the controller instead of going to the update function. 
May be this happens because of multipart=true , which might be modifying the default PUT method of update to POST which is of create. 
For time being , i have changed the path in the update form and pointing it to my actual update function.
