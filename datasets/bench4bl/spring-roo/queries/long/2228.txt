Running this script:
project --topLevelPackage com.dummy.bug
gwt setup
gwt setup
fails with:
Command 'gwt setup' was found but is not currently available (type 'help' then ENTER to learn about this command)
Now obviously that wasn't how I found the bug. I was working through one of the samples, added a field and saw that none of the gwt files had been updated to reflect the added field so ran setup a second time.  Too new to roo to know if that's a bug or not.
This was using: 1.1.3.BUILD-SNAPSHOT [rev 6279004]
