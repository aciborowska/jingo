When managing entity relationships, the following code is generated in MyClcass_Roo_JavaBean.aj :
    declare @field: * MyClass.MyProperty: -@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY);
The "minus" in front of @ManyToOne generates the following error :
    Annotation removal does not allow values to be specified for the annotation (compiler limitation)
Removing the "minus" solves the problem.
