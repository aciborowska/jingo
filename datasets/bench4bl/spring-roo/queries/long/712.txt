I added a repository in my pom that did not include a "name" element:






<repository>




    <id>spring-json</id>




    <url>http://spring-json.sourceforge.net/repository</url>




</repository>






I started Roo and got the following error:

Unable to obtain required element 'name' from element '[repository: null]'
I can add a name element to my repository definition, no problem. Just wanted to log this issue as the error message is not very particular and the condition of not having a name element in a repository definition should maybe not result in an error.
Seems to affect 1.1, but not 1.0.2.
