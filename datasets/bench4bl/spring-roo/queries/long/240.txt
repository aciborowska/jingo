Roo cleverly won't let you use a SQL reserved word as a Java data-member to avoid possible problems later when persisting to a SQL database.
However the check should consider the new  --column option.   The column option can override the data-member name, so it is the column name that needs checking. Equally the name specified by --column might be a reserved SQL keyword, even if the data-member name is not.
