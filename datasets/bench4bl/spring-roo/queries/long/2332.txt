It seems the Cloud Foundry Add On is installed:
roo> cloud foundry login --email eberhard.wolff@gmail.com --password *****
Credentials saved.
Logged in successfully with email address 'eberhard.wolff@gmail.com'
But if you enter just "cloud foundry" the installation instructions are shown:
roo> cloud foundry 
Command 'cloud foundry' not found (for assistance press TAB or type "hint" then hit ENTER)
