Roo grinds to almost a standstill when running the attached script.  The script was generated from a UML model with lots of inheritance.  Roo takes very long to update *_Roo_ToString.aj files when it gets to the references sub-script.  I tried appending simple toString methods to all classes using the attached Python script after creating the classes, but restarting Roo results in the same slow down when it tries to delete the *_Roo_ToString.aj files.
