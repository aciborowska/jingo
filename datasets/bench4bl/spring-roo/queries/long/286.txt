For example, if I have an object with a "title" property (say, employee.title or book.title), roo generates pages with conflicting id attributes on html elements. In my own case, I had a create.jspx page that created the following jsp code:
Line 3:    <div id="_title" style="width: 100%">
Line 34:                 <form:textarea cssStyle="width:250px" id="_title" path="title"/>
Line 37:                 <form:errors cssClass="errors" id="_title" path="title"/>
I'm not sure about the last one, which may not create an html element in the generated html, but the first two create html elements both with id="_title". (As a result, due to js errors, that page doesn't even display.) 
Perhaps Roo ought to use more complex naming on its non-user-specified elements such as the title pane widget's div.
