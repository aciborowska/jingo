MemberDetailsScanner uses the passed FQCN string to determine whether to skip a request for a particular metadata provider. It is preferable therefore to present a MetadataProvider's FQCN if that MetadataProvider caused the MemberDetailsScanner invocation, or one of its helper classes within that MetadataProvider's control flow caused the invocation. A change to WebScaffoldMetadata is required to reflect this.
