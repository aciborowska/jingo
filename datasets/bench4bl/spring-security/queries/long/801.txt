It seems it is not possible to create additional exceptions that extends AuthenticationException and register them in the exceptionMappings Properties variable contained in org.acegisecurity.ui.AbstractProcessingFilter.
Seems that doAddExtraDefaultExceptionMappings(Properties exceptionMappings) method is protected and it is not implemented (http://www.jdocs.com/acegi/1.0.0/org/acegisecurity/providers/ProviderManager.html) in org.acegisecurity.providers.ProviderManager. Then, it obligates you to use one of the default Exceptions loaded in its afterPropertiesSet().
