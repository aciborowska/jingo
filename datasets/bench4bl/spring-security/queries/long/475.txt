In case the userDetailsService throws a DataAccessException for some reason, TBRMS fails heavily, with the 500 exception shown to the user.
This is due to the following code fragment in autoLogin:
				try 
{
					userDetails = getUserDetailsService().loadUserByUsername(
							cookieTokens[0]);
				}
 catch (UsernameNotFoundException notFound) 
{
					cancelCookie(request, response,
							"Cookie token[0] contained username '"
									+ cookieTokens[0] + "' but was not found");

					return null;
				}

DataAccessException is thrown by loadUserByUsername, but not handled by TBRMS.
Adding
				catch (DataAccessException daoException) 
{
					cancelCookie(request, response, "Data access exception.");

					return null;
				}

should probably solve the problem.
