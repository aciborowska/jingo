You can find out more about the problem from the topic:
http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?108517-NullPointerException-while-using-lt-security-authentication-gt-under-JBoss-6.1&p=359562#post359562
To be short: security.tld is really old and must be updated
I prepared some version of it and fixed my problem
Can you please use in in later releases?
