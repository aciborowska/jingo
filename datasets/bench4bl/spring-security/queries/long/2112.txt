ExceptionMappingAuthenticationFailureHandler does not forward to the destination failure url if it is configure to do so with setUseForward.
The documentation for ExceptionMappingAuthenticationFailureHandler does not specify whether it will forward to to destination failure url if it is configured to do so.
http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/apidocs/org/springframework/security/web/authentication/ExceptionMappingAuthenticationFailureHandler.html
I think, given that it inherits from SimpleUrlAuthenticationFailureHandler (which does forward if configured to do so), either it ought to forward as well, or else the documentation should specify that it will not.
