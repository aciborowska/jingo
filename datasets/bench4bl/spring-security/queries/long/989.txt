In section 2.2.2.1, "What does auto-config include", the documentation states that
<intercept-url pattern="/**" access="ROLE_USER"/>
is part of the default configuration. Behaviorally this does not seem to be the case (I tested it), and the HttpSecurityBeanDefinitionParser.java source seems to confirm that no intercept URLs are included as part of the default configuration.
