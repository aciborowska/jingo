Hello,
I need to define a property placeholder to configure the access for an intercept URL pattern:
<security:http>
  <security:intercept-url pattern="/**" access="ROLE_$
{access.role}
" />
</security:http>
As the HttpSecurityBeanDefinitionParser doesn't create BeanDefinitions for any the properties (and sub-properties) that are passed to the FilterSecurityInterceptor, the PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer can't substitute them. This issue looks very equal to SEC-975, but I guess it's a little harder to solve as the pattern-access map resides deeper in the object hierarchy.
Kind regards
Marc
