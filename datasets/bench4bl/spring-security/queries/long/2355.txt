With the following code






<!-- OAuth 2 scopes for GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE -->




<security:intercept-url pattern="/**" method="GET" access="#oauth2.hasScope('read')" /> 




<security:intercept-url pattern="/**" method="POST" access="#oauth2.hasScope('write')" /> 




<security:intercept-url pattern="/**" method="PUT" access="#oauth2.hasScope('write')" /> 




<security:intercept-url pattern="/**" method="PATCH" access="#oauth2.hasScope('write')" /> 




<security:intercept-url pattern="/**" method="DELETE" access="#oauth2.hasScope('delete')" /> 






I get the following error:






Caused by: org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 25; columnNumber: 93; cvc-enumeration-valid: Value 'PATCH' is not facet-valid with respect to enumeration '[GET, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST, PUT, TRACE]'. It must be a value from the enumeration.






We would like to support the PATCH method in our API in order to support partial updates.
