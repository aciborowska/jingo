There is no documentation of how the various configurers of WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter work together. You get a different configurer if you use and() than if you keep chaining with .. The Spring doc still uses examples using XML config where as Java config has been fully supported since 3.x. A search on the internet reveals the usual approach taken by most people is to pick random pieces and shoehorn those together. In other words, throw pasta at the wall and hope that it sticks. This is a dangerous situation with something as crucial as security config.
Expected outcome:

Document the relationships between the various configurers and filters. Who builds who and what is chained with what else.
Show some non-trivial examples of customization, like adding a custom filter, authentication provider and access decision manager.
For advanced users, show example of how to post-process a security related bean.
