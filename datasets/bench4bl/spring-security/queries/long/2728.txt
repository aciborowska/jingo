The documentation states about the cache-control header support:
If you actually want to cache specific responses, your application can selectively invoke HttpServletResponse.setHeader(String,String) to override the header set by Spring Security. This is useful to ensure things like CSS, JavaScript, and images are properly cached.
Judging from our own experiments and the code, this is not possible. The Pragma: no-cache header will always be set, and is impossible to override, since there is no defined 'cache' value, and no way in the Servlet API to remove a header once set.
This is at least a documentation bug, but it would be nice if the Pragma header is only set when there are no cache-control headers set by the application (but that seems to be hard given the current architecture, since headers are set before the request is passed on in the filter chain).
