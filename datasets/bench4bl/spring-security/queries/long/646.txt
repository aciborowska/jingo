I'm using <security:annotation-driven/>
Here is the error message :
[22:35:21]WARN  [AbstractSecurityInterceptor] Could not validate configuration attributes as the ObjectDefinitionSource did not return a ConfigAttributeDefinition Iterator
NOTE : There is a binary incompatability between spring-security between spring 2.0 and spring-2.5.  Rather than compiling spring-security against the spring-2.5 jars I made a patch to change spring-security so that when compiled against spring-2.0, it is binary compatible with spring-2.5.  See http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SEC-627
If you apply the patch on that task, you can get spring-security running with spring 2.5, then you can run my demo app which I will attach in a zip
