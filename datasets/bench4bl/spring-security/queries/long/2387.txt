Loading ldif which defines custom attribute generates warnings and the attribute is not added.






ServerStringValue.java:247 WARN Cannot normalize the value :Encountered name based id of optionalprotocols which was not found in the OID registry






And later on a try to use that attribute:






DefaultOidRegistry.java:148 WARN OID for name 'optionalprotocols' was not found within the OID registry




DefaultServerEntry.java:307 WARN The attribute 'optionalprotocols' cannot be stored






It works fine with plain ApacheDS. Some digging shows that interceptors break this feature. When disabled - commented the line






service.setInterceptors( list );






in ApacheDSContainer (only default interceptors from DefaultDirectoryService applied) it works fine.
Sample configuration and ldif given in the forum thread.
I created also a test case which reproduced a problem on master (will post the link in a few minutes).
