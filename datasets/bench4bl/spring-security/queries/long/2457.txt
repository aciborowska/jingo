<security:form-login login-page='/login' default-target-url="/" authentication-failure-url="/loginfailed" />
<security:logout logout-success-url="/" invalidate-session="true" logout-url="/logout" />
Warning appear on each line : "Method 'setFilterProcessesUrl' is marked deprecated"
Is there now a new recommended way to do this?
I have not seen anything in the documentation about it.
