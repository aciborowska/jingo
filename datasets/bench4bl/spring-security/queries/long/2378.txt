There's a small documentation error in the latest CSRF section (http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.x-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/csrf.html) concerning Multipart upload (13.5.4):
"The first option is to ensure that the MultipartFilter is specified before the Spring Security filter. Specifying the MultipartFilter after the Spring Security filter means that there is no authorization for invoking the MultipartFilter which means anyone can place temporary files on your server."
should probably read
"The first option is to ensure that the MultipartFilter is specified before the Spring Security filter. Specifying the MultipartFilter before the Spring Security filter means that there is no authorization for invoking the MultipartFilter which means anyone can place temporary files on your server."
