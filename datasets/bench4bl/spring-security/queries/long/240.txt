log4j.properties is included in acegi-security-1.0.0-RC2.jar. In certain circumstances this prevent log4j to load user's config file, instead log4j configured from log4j.properties from acegi-security-1.0.0-RC2.jar. While it can be workarounded by passing configuration filename property to log4j or by using log4j.xml it is undesirable anyway because it takes some time to understand why log4j doesn't work.
