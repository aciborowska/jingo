I think lines 378-383 should refer to anonymousElt, not httpElt. As it stands,  <security:anonymous /> namespace attributes are ignored.
        if (anonymousElt != null) 
{
            grantedAuthority = httpElt.getAttribute("granted-authority");
            username = httpElt.getAttribute("username");
            key = httpElt.getAttribute("key");
            source = pc.extractSource(anonymousElt);
        }
