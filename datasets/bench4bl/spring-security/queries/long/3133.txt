Section 10.3.1 of the Spring security documentation (Testing Form Based Authentication) states:
We can also customize the parameters names that the username and password are included on. For example, this is the above request modified to include the username on the HTTP parameter "u" and the password on the HTTP parameter "p".
The actual example is:






mvc




	.perform(formLogin("/auth").user("a","admin").password("p","pass"))







The "a" parameter should actually be "u" in the code example
