Bug reported by Joseph Dane that when AbstractProcessingFilter attempts to access the HttpSession and modify the attribute (ACEGI_SECURITY_LAST_EXCEPTION_KEY) it may suffer a NotSerializableException and in turn fail.
Need to silently catch any exceptions that are thrown when accessing HttpSession so filter does not prematurely fail.
