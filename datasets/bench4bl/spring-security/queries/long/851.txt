In the samples-ldap applicationContext-security.xml I've commented out the <s:ldap-authentication-provider .../> namespace bean to try the traditional bean version config. 
I'm unable to login, getting this exception:
Your login attempt was not successful, try again.
Reason: localhost:389; nested exception is javax.naming.CommunicationException: localhost:389 [Root exception is java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect]; nested exception is org.springframework.ldap.CommunicationException: localhost:389; nested exception is javax.naming.CommunicationException: localhost:389 [Root exception is java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect]
The <s:ldap-server .../> namespace-based bean was NOT commented out. This is all that was commented out:
<!--
<s:ldap-authentication-provider 
group-search-filter="member=
{0}" 
group-search-base="ou=groups"
user-search-base="ou=people"
user-search-filter="uid={0}
"
/>
-->
