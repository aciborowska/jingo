If a particular attribute has not been retrieved from the directory (e.g. because it doesn't exist, or the user doesn't have permissions to read it), then in the code
            Attribute roleAttribute = attributes.get(roleAttributes[i]);
            NamingEnumeration attributeRoles = roleAttribute.getAll();
roleAttribute may be null and the second line will cause  a NullPointerException. A check should be made that the value isn't null and a debug message logged if it is.
