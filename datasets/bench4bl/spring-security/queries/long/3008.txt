SimpleUrlAuthenticationFailureHandler.java






protected final void saveException(HttpServletRequest request,




			AuthenticationException exception) {




		if (forwardToDestination) {




			request.setAttribute(WebAttributes.AUTHENTICATION_EXCEPTION, exception);




		}




// more code




}






We have REST services that do not have the concept of a forwarding page but we must catch all auth errors and turn them into something more digestible for the user. The block of code above unnecessarily needed us to subclass SimpleUrlAuthenticationFailureHandler. It is short sightedness to check for the existence of a "page" before setting the exception. It could be set in the request anyway.
