Attempting to upgrade spring framework to 3.2.1 and spring security to 3.2.0.  The spring security website claims that spring security is compatible with 3.2.0+ of spring framework.  In an OSGi environment, this is not true as spring security bundle manifest attempts spring framework package imports with a version range maximum of 3.2.0. I tried also using spring security 3.2.0M1 and the issue is the same.
