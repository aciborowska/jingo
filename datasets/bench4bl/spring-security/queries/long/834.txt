The current filter-based approach won't work since it makes a decision after the request has been completed, at which point the jsessionid prior to the request  may have been used in a URL. Possible options are
1. Move the filter to a position after the authentication filters and create the new session prior to proceeding to make sure the change takes place before any pages are rendered.
2. Use a strategy which will be called from the authentication filters.
Workaround is to disable session fixation protection (use session-fixation-protection='none' in the <http> namespace element).
