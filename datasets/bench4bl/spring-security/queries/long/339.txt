It appears that there is a serious flaw in the Acegi security version 1.0.1. The code that matches the URL to the determine whether the URL security filters should be applied is doing a .lastIndexOf("?") (this may or may not be right) to trim out the parameters. Therefore any request URL that has two consequent question marks in it would bypass all the filters.
For example if *.html is protected and the request url is x.html or x.html? the filters would be applied. However if the requested URL is x.html?? the filters would be bypassed and sceurity is compromised.
