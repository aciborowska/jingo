Behavior is follows:

When exists server token in token store(HttpSession), InvalidCsrfTokenException occurred.


When does not exists server token in token store(HttpSession), MissingCsrfTokenException occurred.

I think that should be occur the InvalidCsrfTokenException at both cases.
How do think ?
