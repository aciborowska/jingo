When login at the same time(race condition) by multiple clients using same username, it can be login at the same time.
Security setting that not allowed to login at the same time by multiple sessions is follows:






<sec:concurrency-control




    max-sessions="1"




    error-if-maximum-exceeded="true" />






I think that need a synchronization mechanism by a username(authentication name) at the SessionAuthenticationStrategy processing.
