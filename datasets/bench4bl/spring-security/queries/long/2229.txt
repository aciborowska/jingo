There are a number of dependencies within Spring Security that should be marked as optional.
For example, spring-jdbc is listed in spring-security-web but not marked as optional. The use of spring-jdbc is restricted to JdbcTokenRepositoryImpl which is used for remember me support.
We should go through all the dependencies and ensure the dependencies that are optional are marked as such.
