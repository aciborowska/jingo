The directions for a basic intro into securing a spring mvc web application seem to be wrong.  I cannot follow them and produce the expected results.
1) It says "Enter SecurityWebApplicationInitializer for the Name" of a the class.  But the source code for the class has the class name as:
public class MessageSecurityWebApplicationInitializer
This is easy enough to fix.
2) It says "our Spring root application context is initialized using MessageWebApplicationInitializer which is included with our spring-security-samples-messages-jc "  However I cannot find a class by this name any where.  In fact I did a search for usages of the super class "AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer".  I did not find any usages of that class.
I followed as many instructions as I could, but in the end I could not get a login screen.  I like Spring and I am sure you did a good job at the security library.  I just have a hard time getting an idea of what it does without a working intro.  
As an aside I recommend when you give people the git command, clone from a tag instead of cloning from the tip.
git clone https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-security.git -b 3.2.0.RC2
