The parameter tokenValiditySeconds in AbstractRememberMeServices is currently an int.
This easily leads to an integer overflow if for example this value represents 1 month (30 days).
In this case tokenValiditySeconds is configured to be 2592000.
However 2592000 * 1000 calculates to -1702967296, so the cookie is always immediately expired, thus remember me doesn't work in this case.
The solution would to multiply with 1000L (a long 1000) instead of 1000.
See TokenBasedRememberMeServices, line 155
        long expiryTime = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000*tokenLifetime;
and PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices, line 93
        if (token.getDate().getTime() + getTokenValiditySeconds()*1000 < System.currentTimeMillis()) {
