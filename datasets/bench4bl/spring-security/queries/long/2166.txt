the method createNewAuthentication takes a password argument (the new password) which it then ignores.
While this appears to be a bug, it should have a negligible impact on users in most cases since the password is not used once the user is authenticated.  In fact, one could argue that since the namespace defaults to clearing out the credentials, we should not be populating the password at all.
