The documentation on the landing page is incorrect: http://www.springsource.org/spring-security The issue tracker link and the source repository link go to Spring Webflow.  The view Maven artifacts link just takes you to the maven configuration section on the same page. It doesn't take you to anywhere to view the artifacts. The version that it says is current is 3.0.5 and the release version is 3.0.7.
