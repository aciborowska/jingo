I have SPRING METHOD security fully configured for my web application. (with PRE/POST annotations enabled).
However recently I encountered a Strange issue with them. Summary as follows:
Summary of POJOS






     // User Class




      public class User{




      int id;




      String name;




      // getters and setters




    }




 




    //Group Class




            public class Group{




            int id;




            String name;




            // getters and setters




            }




 




      //GroupMembership class




  public class GroupMembership {




    private int id;




    private User user;




    private Group group;




// getters and setters




}












PreAuthorise filter on method .






   @PreAuthorize("canIEditGroupProfile(#membership.group.id)")




public int updateGroupMembership(GroupMembership membership) throws GroupsServiceException;







Upon passing a fully populated GroupMembership object (proper user and group compositions present), the security filter throws following exception:
 errorMessage: "Failed to evaluate expression canIEditGroupProfile(#membership.group.id)'"
Upon digging into the exception:
The cause is found to be:
    org.springframework.expression.spel.SpelEvaluationException: EL1007E:(pos 33): Field or property 'group' cannot be found on null
Please provide pointers to address the same.
