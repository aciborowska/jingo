@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('ROLE_TELLER')")
but "hasAuthority" is wrong. work around is to use "hasRole" instead.
<intercept-url pattern="/login.jsp*" access="IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY"/> also is not working.
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Failed to evaluate expression 'IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'
work around is to use:
<intercept-url pattern="/login.jsp*" access="permitAll" />
