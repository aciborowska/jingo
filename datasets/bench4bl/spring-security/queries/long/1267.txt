in spring security svn repos, under https://src.springsource.org/svn/spring-security/trunk/itest/web/src/main/webapp/secure/ , there exsits a file named "file?with?special?chars.html".
if i use a svn client tool updating the repos, such as "svn update", a error will throw.
"svn: Can't check path 'D:\springsource\workspace\spring-security\itest\web\src\main\webapp\secure\file?with?special?chars.html': 文件名、目录名或卷标"
could us fix or improve it?
