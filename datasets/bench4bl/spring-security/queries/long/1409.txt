There are three example wiring fragments in the manual that use the wrong package name for FilterSecurityInterceptor.
I've seen a number of these problems (class/interface name changed, package changed) so far in the 3.0.x manual resulting from the grand renaming that happened 3.0.  IMO, you need to task someone to trawl through the document and (re-)check all of the names.  Or maybe they could write some script to extract class/package names from the document source and check them against a list of currently defined classnames extracted from the sourcecode base.
