It contains the code
    private SessionRegistry sessionRegistry = new SessionRegistryImpl();
which is a bad idea, since SessionRegistryImpl must be registered through the application context in order to receive "session destroyed" events. If the user fails to set the sessionRegistry property then things won't work properly. The ConcurrentSessionFilter may also be using a different session registry instance.
