Using plain but secured HTML pages, I have the same problem of a redisplayed login form due to a caching problem (not using ShallowEtagHeaderFilter).
The fix for SEC-1412 should be extended to not include "If-Modified-Since" headers. Their presence results in the same behavior: The "cached" login form is displayed instead of the "real" page. Excluding theses headers fixes the problem.
