Hi,
in the documentation page http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.0.CI-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/csrf.html#csrf-multipartfilter, it is written :
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>MultipartFilter</filter-name>
    <servlet-name>/*</servlet-name>
</filter-mapping>
"servlet-name"? Where does that come from? I think "url-pattern" would work way better!
Hours wasted on that, so please take a minute to fix it 
Regards
