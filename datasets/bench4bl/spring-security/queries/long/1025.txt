The readme.txt for the tutorial says to simply run the application directly from the checked out source tree, using the command
mvn jetty:run
This will start jetty on port 8080, with SSL support on port 8443.
It doesn't work, because the build depends on jets3t-0.5.1-20080115, which isn't in any of the default Maven repositories (ibiblio has 0.5.0, 0.6.0 and 0.6.1). Adding
 	<repositories>
		<repository>
			<id>springExternal</id>
			<name>Spring external dependencies</name>
			<url>http://maven.springframework.org/external/&lt;/url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
to the pom.xml resolves the dependency.
