I have confirmed this issue with TokenBasedRememberMeServices.  The remember me cookie is a string of the form:
username + ":" + expiryTime + ":" + Md5Hex(username + ":" + expiryTime + ":" + password + ":" + key)
This is 3 tokens seperated by colons.  sample:
doejohn:1767839462751:494b6435d6d0c2146bc608782543f805
When the username contains a colon, which is the default with spring-social, cookie decoding fails as it encounters 4 tokens (splitting the username into 2 separate tokens).  sample:
twitter:1705891096:1767839462751:494b6435d6d0c2146bc608782543f805
It appears there is an existing hack to deal with urls containing colons ("https://...") in AbstractRememberMeServices.decodeCookie().  I suggest urlencoding the value before creating the cookie string; and the url decoding the token when later retrieved from the cookie.
