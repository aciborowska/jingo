When the user's DN contain commas (e.g., "CN=Smith\, John,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com") or other special characters, login succeeds when the application is deployed on Tomcat but fails when the application is deployed on WebSphere. The reason is because WebSphere does not automatically escape the name returned from the JNDI context, and creation of the DistinguishedName in SpringSecurityLdapTemplate fails because the name string cannot be parsed.
Per the workaround solution at http://www.forumeasy.com/forums/thread.jsp?tid=117953389182&fid=ldapprof13&highlight=JNDI+Backslash+Problem:+Part+SearchResult.getName%28%29, I solved this by making a small change in SpringSecurityLdapTemplate.java (3.0.4), line 210, as follows:
Before:
DistinguishedName dn = new DistinguishedName(searchResult.getName());
After:
String name = new CompositeName(searchResult.getName()).get(0);
DistinguishedName dn = new DistinguishedName(name);
