Migration guide at:
http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/migrate/current/3-to-4/html5/migrate-3-to-4-xml.html#m3to4-xmlnamespace-logout
Quoting from the above:

The form-login@username-parameter attribute default value changed from "/j_spring_security_logout" to "/logout". If an application explicitly provides the attribute, no action is required for the migration.
This should probably refer to "logout@logout-url" instead. I'm also not sure if the link is wrong (links to 3.2 where the referenced anchor doesn't seem to exist)
