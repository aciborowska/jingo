From email:
I was reading the Acegi Reference 1.0.4 in PDF format and I found some little errors, but I found one that I think is more important:
In the page 72 in the sentece:
"Like many other parts of Acegi Security, AfterInvocationManager has a single concrete implementation, AfterInvocationProvider, which polls a list of AfterInvocationProviders"
must be:
"Like many other parts of Acegi Security, AfterInvocationManager has a single concrete implementation, AfterInvocationProviderManager, which polls a list of AfterInvocationProviders
