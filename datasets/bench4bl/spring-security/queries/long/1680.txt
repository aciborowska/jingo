According to the Spring 3.0.x documentation, there is a delete-cookies attribute on the <logout> element
http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/reference/appendix-namespace.html#nsa-logout
However, it is not present in the XSD or the code and according to SEC-1544 this feature was only added to 3.1.0 and not to the 3.0.x stream.
