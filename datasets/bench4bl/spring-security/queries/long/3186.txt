When a user tries to access a page which is only allowed for authorized users, the user is redirected to the login page and the original request is saved in the HttpRequestCache. 
However when the user then accesses a public page the saved request is not cleared and therefore when the user now navigates directly to the login page and logs himself in, he is redirected to the authorized page he tried to access in the beginning.
But shouldn't the user be redirected to the defaultsuccessurl in this case, because he didn't try to access the authorized page right before the login?
UPDATE:
If you need any additional infos or exapmles, please let me know!
