Even I define an AfterInvocationProviderManager, it can't be auto-wired into the MethodSecurityInterceptor when I use <global-method-security> to secure methods with @Secured. So the AfterInvocationProviders don't work with the @Secured annotations. I can only use <security:intercept-methods> to have my AfterInvocationProviders work!
