The HSQL Sample script  provided (from the home page and in the repository ) is invalid
CREATE TABLE acl_permission (
     id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(START WITH 0)  NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
     acl_object_identity BIGINT NOT NULL,
     recipient VARCHAR_IGNORECASE(100) NOT NULL,
     mask INTEGER NOT NULL,
     CONSTRAINT unique_recipient UNIQUE(acl_object_identity, recipient),
     FOREIGN KEY (acl_object_identity) REFERENCES acl_object_identity(id)
);
It should read 
CREATE TABLE acl_permission (
     id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(START WITH 0)  NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
     acl_object_identity BIGINT NOT NULL,
     recipient VARCHAR_IGNORECASE(100) NOT NULL,
     mask INTEGER NOT NULL,
     CONSTRAINT unique_recipient UNIQUE(acl_object_identity, recipient),
     FOREIGN KEY (acl_object_identity) REFERENCES acl_object_identity(id)
);
