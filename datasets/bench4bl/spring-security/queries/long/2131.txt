Reference documentation, chapter 3.3.3 says that:
.bq  the second authentication takes place through another non-interactive mechanism, such as “remember-me”, an “unauthorized” (402) error will be sent to the client.
This should be "Unauthorized" (401) of course.
The schema says the same:






<xs:attribute name="session-authentication-error-url" type="xs:token">




  <xs:annotation>




    <xs:documentation>Defines the URL of the error page which should be shown when the SessionAuthenticationStrategy raises an exception. If not set, an unauthorized (402) error code will be returned to the client. Note that this attribute doesn't apply if the error occurs during a form-based login, where the URL for authentication failure will take precedence.</xs:documentation>




    </xs:annotation>




</xs:attribute>
