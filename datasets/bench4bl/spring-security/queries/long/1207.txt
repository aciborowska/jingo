In spring-security-samples-cas-client: 
in src/main/webapp/casfailed.jsp.
AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter is imported, but AbstractProcessingFilter is used.
Presumably where it is using AbstractProcessingFilter  it should be using AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter.
Will cause the JSP to fail when the server compiles the JSP.
