In an annotation-driven spring project, if @Secured annotation was added to a class or method of a spring scala controller (annotated with @Controller and @RequestMapping) – such class will disappear from URL mapping. No exceptions or warnings can be found in the log (even with DEBUG level). If securing is done within xml configuration ("intercept-url" tag) – all works just fine. Code sample and full description is available via reference URL (StackOverflow).
