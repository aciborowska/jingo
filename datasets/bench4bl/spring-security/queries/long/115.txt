Acegifier doesn't have a Maven build. I've made some changes so it has a basic Maven structure, but unit tests don't pass:
Testcase: testFileConversion(acegifier.WebXmlConverterTests):	Caused an ERROR
Provider for javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory cannot be found
javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactoryConfigurationError: Provider for javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory cannot be found
	at javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory.newInstance(Unknown Source)
	at acegifier.WebXmlConverter.<init>(WebXmlConverter.java:55)
	at acegifier.WebXmlConverterTests.testFileConversion(WebXmlConverterTests.java:34)
I've made some changes to the stylesheets to reflect the 1.0.0 new package names, but I'd like to try it out. Would you please correct ASAP.
