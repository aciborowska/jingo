I'm using latest daily snapshot of spring-security with spring 2.5.1.
form-login page doesn't use spring messageSource for translations. 
Other jsp's get translated messages successfully, but my form-login page doesn't. 
I can get translations using <fmt:setBundle>, but then I don't get to use the nice stuff spring does.
