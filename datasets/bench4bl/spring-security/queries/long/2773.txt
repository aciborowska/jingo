The fix for SEC-2574 introduced an @Bean method declaring a DelegatingApplicationListener on WebSecurityConfiguration. ApplicationListeners are looked up very early in the container lifecycle and due to the declaring method being an instance method the container needs to initialize the configuration class in its entirety. This in turn causes the container having to lookup the parameters of setFilterChainProxySecurityConfigurer(â€¦) on a by-type basis which causes initializations of a lot of Factory beans and other configuration classes.
Changing the bean declaration to be a static method, prevents the need for the premature instantiation of the configuration class. Pull request coming.
