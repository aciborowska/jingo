Anyway, the flaw is in the ACL which is located at:
http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/tutorial.html






The ACL is as follows:




<http use-expressions="true">




    <intercept-url pattern="/index.jsp" access="permitAll" />




    <intercept-url pattern="/secure/**" access="isAuthenticated()" />




    <intercept-url pattern="/secure/extreme/**"




access="hasRole('supervisor')" />




    <intercept-url pattern="/listAccounts.html" access="isAuthenticated()" />




    <intercept-url pattern="/post.html"




access="hasAnyRole('supervisor','teller')" />




    <intercept-url pattern="/**" access="denyAll" />




    <form-login />




</http>






The problem is lines 2 and 3 - they need to be reversed. Line 3
(/secure/extreme) will never be reached because the ACL will always
match on /secure one line above. (For the record, yes I did test this
out). The ACL is the same on the webpage and in the downloaded code
sample.
