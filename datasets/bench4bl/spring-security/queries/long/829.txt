On the following page:
http://static.springframework.org/spring-security/site/reference/html/namespace-config.html
You can find the following line
<global-method-security secured-annotations="enabled" jsr250-annotations="true"/>
The "true" is wrong, according to the schema that attribute needs to be enabled or disabled.
