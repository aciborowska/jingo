Hi, 
I am not sure this is the right place to post this issue but the release 3.1.3 of Spring Security is not published on the SpringSource EBR (http://ebr.springsource.com/repository/app/).
Nonetheless, the canonical Spring Security bundles can be used within an OSGi environment (hence the "minor" priority).
