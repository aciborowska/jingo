"DaoAuthenticationProvider.java around line 300, publishes an
AuthenticationSuccessEvent when the user has logged in.  However - it
only does this if the cache wasn't used... This seems odd and incorrect
to me.
Since this sequence of events misses the second event :
1)       login as user A - event is fired
2)       logout
3)       login as user A - event isn't fired
