I think the example should change from
@PreAuthorize("#contact.name == principal.name)")
public void doSomething(Contact contact);
To
@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated() and #contact.name == principal.username")
public void doSomething(Contact contact);
Reasoning:
1) Remove the stray ) character; syntax error
2) add isAuthenticated; the AnonymousAuthenticationFilter places a String as the principal and not a UserDetails object (An IllegalArgumentException is thrown when the user is not authenticated without this).
3) change principal.name to principal.username; UserDetails (the principal for authenticated object) contains a username property and not a name property
