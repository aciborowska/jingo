In the generated source artifact (spring-security-aspects-3.1.0.RELEASE-sources.jar) are missing the .aj files (there are in the binary artifact (*spring-security-aspects-3.1.0.RELEASE.jar)) so when you (or m2e) attach the sources to the corresponding binary jar in Eclipse it doesn't show the aspect source.
For an example of how it must be see spring-aspects-3.1.1.RELEASE-sources.jar and spring-aspects-3.1.1.RELEASE.jar. With these you can view the aspect sources right in the IDE.
