The Spring Security tutorial uses an outdated document type definition; http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/tutorial.html 
It won't run until you update from 'spring-security-3.0.xsd' to 'spring-security-3.0.3.xsd', which causes new problems like:
"Attribute 'pattern' is not allowed to appear in element 'http'"
