ConcurrentSessionControlStrategy.maximumSessions can be "-1" as indication of unlimited session count, but there is not possible to set this value in spring-security context configuration due to XML validation rules:
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: cvc-minInclusive-valid: Value '-1' is not facet-valid with respect to minInclusive '1' for type 'positiveInteger'.
