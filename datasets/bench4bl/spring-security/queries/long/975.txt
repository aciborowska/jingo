Hello,
I am trying to use a property inside Spring security:
	<security:http 
		access-denied-page="$
{security.errorPage}
"
 ...>
		...
	</security:http>
Where security.errorPage is a property defined in a property file loaded by a org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer bean.
But it is not interpreted.
Looking at org.springframework.security.config.HttpSecurityBeanDefinitionParser I got the confirmation it is not a case.
I don't know if it is a feature but I think it may be useful.
Philippe.
