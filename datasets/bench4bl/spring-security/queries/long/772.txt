I am getting a java.lang.IllegalStateException exceptions thrown using Spring Security RC1 (I will attach the full stack trace after creating the issue). The result of the exception is images are not returned to the user after remember-me security processing. The problem can be recreated as follows.
1) Configure spring security, via the filter-mapping, to secure all URLs within the application context including images, java script, style sheets etc (<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>).
2) Configure the dispatcher servlet to listen to .html only (<url-pattern>.html</url-pattern>).
3) Use <security:http auto-config="true" with the default remember-me.
4) Logon and set the _spring_security_remember_me parameter set to true.
5) Open a new browser and go directly to a secured page without logging on such that the RememberMeAuthenticationToken is retrieved and set up. Make sure the returned page has links to images, style sheets, Java script files etc.... For each of these links there will be the java.lang.IllegalStateException generated in the logs. 
A work around for the issue appears to be setting the create-session="always" attribute on the security:http element.
Cheers
