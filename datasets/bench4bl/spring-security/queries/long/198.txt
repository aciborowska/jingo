My application has a role dependent JSP elements, where roles are determined via the authz:authorize tags.
If a URL is hit that throws an AccessDeniedException (not a usual thing I guess, but still...), the user's roles are no longer visible to the authz:authorize tags.
PS - I'll see if I can determine the cause and generate a patch.
