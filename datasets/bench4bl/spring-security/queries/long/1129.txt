I am using Filter proxy to add several filters to my pages
<security:filter-chain-map path-type="ant">
<security:filter-chain filters="filtroLoginAutomatico,filtroLogin,filtroBase ..." pattern="/*/.html*"/>
</security:filter-chain-map>
The * at the end is because some pages have GET parameters. The problem comes when one of those parameters, constains a / character (Text is already escaped with javascript escape function). In that case, the page is not matched. It may be solved, adding a new filter-chain
<security:filter-chain-map path-type="ant">
<security:filter-chain filters="filtroLoginAutomatico,filtroLogin,filtroBase ..." pattern="/*/.html*"/>
<security:filter-chain filters="filtroLoginAutomatico,filtroLogin,filtroBase ..." pattern="/*/.html*/*"/>
</security:filter-chain-map>
Notice the / at the end of the second chain
I think it's a bug, as the / character is in the parameter string and not in the url.
