I'm seeing multiple instances of the LdapAuthenticationProvider bean when using the traditional bean config. In the namespace config I only see one instance. 
So in the samples-ldap app I'm seeing two instances when using the traditional bean config w/ the namespace config commented out and the scope="singleton" attribute applied to the secondLdapProvider bean definition. 
In my app I'm seeing three instances of the LdapAuthenticationProvider bean. It's like the prototype scope is getting applied.  There's one instance that's getting used for authentication, a second instance for a dependency injection bean, not sure about the third instance. I only want ONE shared instance of the LdapAuthenticationProvider bean.
