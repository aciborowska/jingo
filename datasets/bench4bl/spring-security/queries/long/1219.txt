When running mvn site on my project, the build hangs on the following lines: 
[WARNING] The repository url 'http://s3.amazonaws.com/maven.springframework.org/release' is invalid - Repository 'spring-release' will be blacklisted.
[WARNING] The repository url 'http://s3.amazonaws.com/maven.springframework.org/external' is invalid - Repository 'spring-external' will be blacklisted.
This is the same problem as SWS-500 : maven.springframework.org might replace s3.amazonaws.com URLs
Thank you!
