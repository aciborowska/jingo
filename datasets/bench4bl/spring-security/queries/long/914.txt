AFAICS when reading the code the var attribute names a variable which will receive the result of the evaluation of the property attribute. The current documentation says something different:
<description>
  Name of the exported scoped variable for the
  exception thrown from a nested action. The type of the
  scoped variable is the type of the exception thrown.
