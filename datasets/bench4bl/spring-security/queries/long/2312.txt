See, for example, the Javadoc for AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer. It implements WebApplicationInitializer, but the link to WebApplicationInitializer is http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/WebApplicationInitializer.html?is-external=true, which returns a 404 error. The link for AbstractContextLoaderInitializer within the application is also broken. However, the link for ContextLoaderListener, which points to the same Javadoc root, is not broken.
This appears to be because the Javadoc links in Spring Security 3.2 are set to Spring Framework 3.0.x, but Spring Security 3.2 is actually compiled against Spring Framework 3.2.x. This means that classes Spring Security uses are not always present in the Javadoc that Spring Security links to.
It's pretty crippling that you can't navigate between the Javadoc documentation, but it should be a simple fix.
