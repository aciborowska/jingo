In order to use the LDAP feature for authentication and authorization over SSL I had to modify the class :
 org.acegisecurity.providers.ldap.DefaultInitialDirContextFactory
At line 132 I have modified the test:
if (url.startsWith("ldap:")) {
By:
if (url.startsWith("ldap:") || url.startsWith("ldaps:")) {
That's the only way I've been able to do it after a long debugging session.
I hope it will help.
