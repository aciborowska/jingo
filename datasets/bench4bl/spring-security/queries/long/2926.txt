We have added some custom role to user authorities. For example ("OWNER")
calling the request.isUserInRole() works fine.
calling the <sec:authentication property="principal.authorities"/> prints the user role. [OWNER]
The <sec:authorize access="hasRole('OWNER')"> is not working
I set the ROLE prefix to be ignored as mentioned in http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/migrate/current/3-to-4/html5/migrate-3-to-4-xml.html and both isUserInRole()  and sec:authentication worked fine.
I wonder why isUserInRole() was working fine before seting the ROLE prefix ignorance. This is somehow miss-leading!
