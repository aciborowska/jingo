We have been using JavaConfig of spring security since pre .m2 without problems for a while now. After switching to .RC1 and doing the necessary api adjustments, our application runs fine but for the POST calls (mostly async-GWT or jquery calls).
All calls are failing with






org.springframework.security.web.csrf.InvalidCsrfTokenException: Invalid CSRF Token 'null' was found on the request parameter '_csrf' or header 'X-CSRF-TOKEN'. at org.springframework.security.web.csrf.CsrfFilter.doFilterInternal(CsrfFilter.java:(89) at org.springframework.web.filter.OncePerRequestFilter.doFilter(OncePerRequestFilter.java:(107) at org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy$VirtualFilterChain.doFilter(FilterChainProxy.java:(342) at org.springframework.security.web.header.HeaderWriterFilter.doFilterInternal(HeaderWriterFilter.java:(57) 






It seems to be CSRF protection filter is now enabled by default. This does not seem too bad, but until now, I havn't found any way to switch it off.
How can it be done in Java Config?
By the way: http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.x/reference/springsecurity.html is linked but not yet available. 
Thank you very much
