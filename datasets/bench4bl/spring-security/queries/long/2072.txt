Description from the forum:
Hi. I'm using this configuration






<security:anonymous granted-authority="ROLE_INVITADO,ROLE_PROFILE_INVITADO,ROLE_GRUPO_PUBLICO" username="invitado" />






So the guest has 3 roles. Up until spring 3.1.1.RELEASE if I did






SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getAuthorities()






I got 3 authorities (as expected).
In Spring 3.1.2.RELEASE I get only one authority and it's value is






"ROLE_INVITADO,ROLE_PROFILE_INVITADO,ROLE_GRUPO_PUBLICO"






So those 3 comma separated values are not being split in 3.1.2 as they were in 3.1.1.
I'm not sure if it was originally intended to support mutiple roles separating them by comma or not. Was it? Is it now? Any othe way to set that up? Is this a bug in 3.1.2?
I don't see this change in the version changes, maybe it was an unintended consecuence of some other change.
