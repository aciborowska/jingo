Well we are using Active Directory authentication. I'm not sure what's the reason, but our AD has not sAMAccountName as "user@my.domain.com", but only as "user".
Our current solution is to copy&paste class ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider and modify method searchForUser to call SpringSecurityLdapTemplate.searchForSingleEntryInternal(...) with username instead of bindPrincipal. This solution works, but it's really nasty .
Since this class is final and not Spring bean than I have no option (not found any yet) to customize it (to suite it to our AD).
