There is a bug in the switch user processing filter where the set switchFailureUrl is updated every time there is a switch failure. The context path is appended to the failure url resulting in an invalid redirect url from the second time there is an issue switching the user. The following code contains the bug within the redirectToFailureUrl method :
        if (switchFailureUrl != null) 
{
            switchFailureUrl = request.getContextPath() + switchFailureUrl;
            response.sendRedirect(response.encodeRedirectURL(switchFailureUrl));
        }
 else {
The code could be corrected as follows by removing the update to the switchFailureUrl property:
        if (switchFailureUrl != null) 
{
            response.sendRedirect(response.encodeRedirectURL(request.getContextPath() + switchFailureUrl));
        }
 else {
