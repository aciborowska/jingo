We have some DAO which call an other DAO in RowMapper to get linked entities. Sometimes we have to do that to link different loosely coupled entities in depends of included application modules, data base state etc. After migration from Spring 2.5.6 to Spring 3.X we've got the following issue:

org.hibernate.HibernateException: connnection proxy not usable after transaction completion
	at org.hibernate.jdbc.BorrowedConnectionProxy.invoke(BorrowedConnectionProxy.java:66)
	at $Proxy6.prepareStatement(Unknown Source)
	at org.springframework.jdbc.core.PreparedStatementCreatorFactory$PreparedStatementCreatorImpl.createPreparedStatement(PreparedStatementCreatorFactory.java:245)
	at org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate.execute(JdbcTemplate.java:580)

It happens on prepared statement creation for query need to be executed after execution any SQL statement in DAO called from RowMapper. I've created Unit test to show this incident.
