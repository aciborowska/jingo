The reference documentation for access control lists says the following:
Refer to one of the samples that ship with Spring Security for an example configuration
and
refer to the ACL samples for the appropriate SQL statements
However, no ACL sample is listed in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/tree/master/samples. Either no samples actually exist (in which case the documentation needs sample configurations or a sample should be created), or the sample ACL config is buried in some other sample (in which case the documentation should be updated to link to the specific sample or samples that should be referenced). A Spring Security user less knowledgable about the source code would have some difficulty deriving the correct configuration.
