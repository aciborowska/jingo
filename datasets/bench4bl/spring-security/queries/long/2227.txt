AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter handles the filterProcessUrl(j_spring_security_check) inconsistently for the root context compared to other contexts.
See:
https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/authentication/AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter.java#L235
Based on this code if you had a context path of "/development" ONLY "/development/j_spring_security_check" will match BUT if you have a context path of "" (ie root which is what most people deploy to production as) then "/**/j_spring_security_check" will work.
This is an issue if you switch contexts and is IMHO consistent. I think safest solution is to make all contexts act like the root context ("").
