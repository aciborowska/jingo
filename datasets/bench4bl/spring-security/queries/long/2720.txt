Can you please create a new catch-all project called Spring.io Web Site? I have found a dozen broken links to various documentation, and in some cases, as in this case, there is no listed Project in your JIRA (could not find a project for Spring Cloud).
This is a major issue for anyone trying to learn your platform. In this case, on the listed page, half of the example apps are 404s.
As webmaster and architect, might I suggest you run a link checker on your site every evening, and have your test team notified? There's no excuse for having even a single broken link, given today's plethora of tools for detecting them.
If you do not do that, can you please put a prominent link on the footer of your pages to report broken web pages on your site?
