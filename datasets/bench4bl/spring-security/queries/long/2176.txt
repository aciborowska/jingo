I am using PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices, which requires a PersistentTokenRepository, all of which is used to store and retrieve PersistentRememberMeTokens. The problem is that my PersistentTokenRepository is remote, accessed through Spring HttpInvoker. Since the PersistentRememberMeToken is not Serializable, despite all of its properties being Serializable, it simply doesn't work.
Solution: Make PersistentRememberMeToken implement java.io.Serializable.
