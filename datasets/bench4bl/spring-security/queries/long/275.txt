I found that acegi currently got maven2 support. Yet, it missing a dependency from the following pom file: acegisecurity\adapters\cas\pom.xml.
You need to add the following line to the <dependencies> element
<dependency>
<groupId>cas</groupId>
<artifactId>cas-server</artifactId>
<version>3.0.4</version>
</dependency>
after that, go to the top directory, and run "mvn eclipse:eclipse". 
I hope the develop team can fix this problem asap.
