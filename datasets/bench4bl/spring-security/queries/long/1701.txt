The authentication fails if a user copy&pastes his OpenId identity and it includes a white sprace at the end.
An additional space is often append by copy it from hmtl pages or emails.
I've got this problem with 3.0.4, but I'm sure all other versions are also affected.
Fix would look like this at OpenIDAuthenticationFilter.attemptAuthentication():
String identity = request.getParameter("openid.identity");
if (!StringUtils.hasText(identity)) {
       identity = identity.trim(); // FIX
       String claimedIdentity = obtainUsername(request);
Stracktrace:
org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationServiceException: Unable to process claimed identity 'http://alice-franz.myopenid.com/ '
