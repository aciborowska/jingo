None of the methods in SecurityExpressionRoot have any API documentation. Without reading the code, it's not clear what some of them do. For example, it's not clear that hasRole and hasAuthority are just synonyms and don't do anything different.
Normally I'd look for help in the reference documentation for the root expressions, but it's missing most of the methods (probably hasn't been updated since 3.0, and maybe earlier).
The documentation for this class (Javadoc) and the expressions (reference) could be improved a good deal.
