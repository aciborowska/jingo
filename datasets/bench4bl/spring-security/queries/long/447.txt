There is an exploitable XSS in both acegi-security-sample-tutorial and acegi-security-sample-contacts-filter.
I assume that a lot of people are using the login page provided as is, just reskinning it. The problem lies in how the username is automatically re-populated after an incorrect login.
<c:if test="$
{not empty param.login_error}">value='<%= session.getAttribute(AuthenticationProcessingFilter.ACEGI_SECURITY_LAST_USERNAME_KEY) %>'</c:if>

Using the <%= %> tags does not escape html and therefore you could enter something like <script ... /> for a username and probably do some pretty good damage.


The solution is to use <c:out/> tags with EL instead:

<c:if test="${not empty param.login_error}
">value='<c:out value="$
{ACEGI_SECURITY_LAST_USERNAME}
"/></c:if>
