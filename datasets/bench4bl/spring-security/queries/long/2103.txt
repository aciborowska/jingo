In case of empty remember me tokens JdbcTokenRepositoryImpl writes thread dump to log file that is not required because it's clear from context:






        catch(EmptyResultDataAccessException zeroResults) {




            if(logger.isInfoEnabled()) {




                logger.info("Querying token for series '" + seriesId + "' returned no results.", zeroResults);




            }




        }






Is it possible to change level to debug or remove thread dump (better for me)?
