When using Spring Security using <authentication-manager alias="foo"/> makes it possible to reference the AuthenticationManager used with the id foo. However this is not noticed by Spring IDE which adds a warning of the form: Referenced bean 'foo' not found
It should be noted that the code works when it's run. See Spring Forum thread for more details.
