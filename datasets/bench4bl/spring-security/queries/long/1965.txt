The DefaultWebSecurityExpressionHandler no longer implements WebSecurityExpressionHandler which causes issues when using spring-webflow's AbstractAuthorizeTag which looks up the WebExpressionHandler for authorize statements. We should probably also look into getting webflow to use the provided AbstractAuthorizeTag (I haven't had time to investigate why they might have their own copy of this tag).
