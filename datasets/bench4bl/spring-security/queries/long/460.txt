I have an error-page defined in my web.xml.  When my servlet throws an exception HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter clears the SecurityContext but does not clear the FILTER_APPLIED request attribute.   So, when the servlet container dispatches my error-page it hits the HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter again but doesn't put a SecurityContext into the SecurityContextHolder because the FILTER_APPLIED request attribute is already set from a previous invocation of HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter in the same request.
To solve simply set a local flag in the filter if it sets "FILTER_APPLIED" and clear "FILTER_APPLIED in the finally block if this filter was the one to set it.
