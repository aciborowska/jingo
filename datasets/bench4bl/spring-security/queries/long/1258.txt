Incoming requests seem to be wrapped by SavedRequestAwareWrapper in M2 of 3.0. Unfortunately this causes the request to return the method of a previously saved request instead of the current one. This is especially problematic if you do a POST after a GET. If you use Spring MVC e.g. and map one method to a URL handling GET requests, and one handling POST requests this does not work anymore as the wrapped request returns GET as method which is the wrong one apparently. Very obfuscating in this case is, that because every access to the method potentially returns the wrong HTTP method (in the example GET instead of actually sent POST), log output is also invalid. We spent some hours trying to find out why there is a GET received at the server side although a POST was sent .
