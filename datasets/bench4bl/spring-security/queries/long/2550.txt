I have an integration test in my application that tests for classloader leaks and it fails since I introduced spring security. Therefore I tried reproducing the problem with the helloworld-jc sample and it also leaks.
To reproduce:

package the helloworld-jc application
start a tomcat with java 7 or 8
deploy the application
stop the application
execute 'Find Leaks'
see that the application leaks

If you start the application with Java 6, everything works. Therefore this might actually be a java problem but I don't know where to report such a problem.
I also took a heap dump and looked for GC roots from the webappclassloader but could not find any.
