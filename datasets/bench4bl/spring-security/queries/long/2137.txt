Please see the following snippet from our application's security config:






...




    <session-management invalid-session-url="/web/login/timedOut"




                        session-fixation-protection="none"




                        session-authentication-error-url="">




        <concurrency-control expired-url="/web/login/expired"




                             max-sessions="5"




                             error-if-maximum-exceeded="false"




                             session-registry-alias="sessionRegistry" />




    </session-management>




...






The presence of <concurrency-control> causes a ConcurrentSessionControlStrategy to be created. Since this extends SessionFixationProtectionStrategy it forces the enabling of session migration, even if session fixation protection is set to "none". I have verified this by looking at the code. This is pretty big problem, and the documentation certainly does not indicate that this was intentional.
A change to how this whole system works was proposed in SEC-2135. The resolution for that enhancement request will also fix this bug. However, the bug probably needs to exist for tracking and historical purposes.
