Please look here:
http://www.springframework.org/schema/security/spring-security.xsd (or http://www.springframework.org/schema/security/spring-security-3.1.xsd)
and here:
https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-security/blob/master/config/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/config/http/SecurityFilters.java
From XSD it seems that EXCEPTION_TRANSLATION_FILTER goes before SESSION_MANAGEMENT_FILTER, but from the code it seems that direction is opposite. The same issue with CONCURRENT_SESSION_FILTER and SECURITY_CONTEXT_FILTER.
Also I don't know whether it is an issue, but in code there are 25 positions and only 19 are in xsd.
