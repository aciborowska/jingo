When I import Spring Security's Config bundle in my Karaf (3.0.1) OSGi server, I get an error saying that Spring Security LDAP isn't avaialble:
Error executing command: Could not start bundle mvn:org.springframework.security/spring-security-config/3.2.3.RELEASE in feature(s) mm-0.0.0: Unresolved constraint in bundle org.springframework.security.config [172]: Unable to resolve 172.0: missing requirement [172.0] osgi.wiring.package; (&(osgi.wiring.package=org.springframework.security.ldap)(version>=3.2.3.RELEASE)(!(version>=3.3.0)))
However, I don't need LDAP for my purposes. When I start adding LDAP depencency chain, a whole bunch of bundles are required: spring-security-ldap, spring-ldap, spring-batch.
In the end, Spring LDAP requires a package which doesn't seem to be available: (&(osgi.wiring.package=org.springframework.batch.item.file) version>=2.0.0)(!(version>=3.0.0)))
Could we make the LDAP dependency optional in the Manifest?
