In order to allow localisation and personnal messages' definition org.springframework.security.providers.ldap.LdapAuthenticationProvider should implement org.springframework.context.MessageSourceAware.
At this time it's not the case, so it is impossible to modify messages and use messages' localisation for this object (see ยง6.1 in spring security documentation http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/reference/html/supporting-infrastructure.html#localization).
By the way this object also doesn't implement org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean.
