The DefaultLdapAuthoritiesPopulator Javadocs indicate a null groupSearchBase means that no searching will be performed.  The implementation code, in particular getGroupMembershipRoles(), looks like it would handle that just fine, except there is an Assert.notNull in the groupSearchBase setter function.  Being able to set the groupSearchBase to null is handy in situations where you don't really want to search but want to assign a defaultRole to all users.  If the Assert goes away, one could do that very nicely with this class.
