When using create-session="never" in http namespace and security:concurrent-session-control is specified, registerConcurrentSessionControlBeansIfRequired method in HttpSecurityBeanDefinitionParser sets forceEagerSessionCreation to true.
I think this is not required as ConcurrentSessionFilter checks for existence of a session before doing it's job.
My case is that I don't want sessions to be created unless users are logged in, and also I want concurrent session control. Currently, if I want concurrent session control, I'm forced to create sessions for logged out users too which I don't want.
