We are using Security for a Webproject. When the user is in a protected area, https is used for all calls. When the user navigats to a side which is an unprotected area, he'll be redirected from https to http (user requests https://unprotected.area and is redirected to http://unprotected.area by spring security). The AbstractRetryEntryPoint handling this redirect in it's commence() method doesn't encode the url. Possible special characters in the redirect url aren't escaped therefore. This causes redirections to non existing pages when the url contains special characters like german umlauts users browser doesn't understand that special chars.
Please encode the url with the URLEncoder before sending an redirect. Thanks
