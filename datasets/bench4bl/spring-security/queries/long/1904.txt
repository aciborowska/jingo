Section 19.3.3 - Loading Authorities describes group-search-filter as:

group-search-filter. The filter which is used to search for group membership. The default is uniqueMember=
{0}
, corresponding to the groupOfUniqueMembers LDAP class. In this case, the substituted parameter is the full distinguished name of the user. The parameter 
{1}
 can be used if you want to filter on the login name.

However, groupOfUniqueMembers should actually be groupOfUniqueNames. This would make the HTML docs consistent with the javadocs at http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.1.x/apidocs/org/springframework/security/ldap/userdetails/DefaultLdapAuthoritiesPopulator.html.
