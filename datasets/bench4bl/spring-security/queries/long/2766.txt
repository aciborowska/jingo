When using ldap authentication for login purposes, any username containing a backslash has another backslash added in front. 
example\username
becomes
exampleusername
I've confirmed using wireshark that this is the case, and by using ldapsearch I can confirm that the credentials work when there is just a single backslash. 
The issue appears to ldap related, using in memory authentication does not cause the extra backslash character to be added. Hence the issue does not rely with the form itself.
