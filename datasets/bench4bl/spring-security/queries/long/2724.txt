As I have understood, BCrypt is now the recommended password encoder (or one of the recommended, at least). In the reference manual Appendix 1, the password field is defined as varchar_ignorecase(50), but that will not fit a bcrypt hash which normally is 60 characters. The field length should be at least 60.
