Setting up the contacts example on Orion does not work out of the box.
This is because of a bug/feature in Orion where the 'getServletPath' method returns null when called from within a filter.  The FilterInvocation class makes use of this method and therefore fails to do the redirects to the 'j_acegi_security_check'.  Everything works fine if you configure Acegi longhand via the web.xml.
I realise this is more of a bug with Orion (and I have raised it with them) but it would be good if you guys could put a workaround into the framework.  In my investigations I got it work by putting something similar to the following in the 'getRequestUrl()' method of FilterInvocation, but I obviously havn't done a full impact analysis of this change.
 String uri = request.getServletPath();
    if (uri == null) 
{
      uri = request.getRequestURI();
      uri = uri.substring(request.getContextPath().length());
    }

Thanks
