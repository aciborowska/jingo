Hello,
there is a possible race condition in SessionRegistryImpl when handling the principals map (principal -> session id)

A principal P has one Session S1 in its set
Thread A wants to add S2 to the same principal (calling registerNewSession)
Thread A checks whether there is already a Set for principal P and gets a reference to the set containing S1
Thread B wants to remove S1 (calling removeSessionInformation)
Thread B obtains set from principal map and removes S1 from the Set
Thread B checks wheter the Set is empty - it is - as Thread A did not add S2 yet - and removes it from the Map
Thread A adds S2 to the non-referenced Set

Result: principals does not contain S2 as it should. If the session registry is used to limit number of sessions per user, the limit is not enforced. If a Spring application uses the SessionRegistry for other things, they won't work as expected. (listing all logged in users etc.)
