Following a successful authentication from the retrieveUser method of the LdapAuthenticationProvider on the following line...
 LdapUserDetails ldapUser = authenticator.authenticate(username, password);
... an LdapUserDetails object is always returned with a null value for the username.  Am I correct in assuming this is not the desired behaviour ?  We have our own authorities populator that requires the username so we're currently having to parse the username from the LdapUser's dn property.
cheers,
