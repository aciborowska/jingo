The class AbstractAccessDecisionManager contains a method checkAllowIfAllAbstainDecisions. This makes use of the messages.properties file using the MessageSourceAccessor. This is very nice to create custom messages when using access control. Now we want to use ExpressionBasedPostInvocationAdvice but this throws an AccessDeniedException with the hard coded message "Access is denied". I think it is better to reuse the mechanism from the AbstractAccessDecisionManager.
