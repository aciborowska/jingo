The link to the ACL section in
http://static.springframework.org/spring-security/site/reference/html/appendix-schema.html#d4e3041
points to:
http://static.springframework.org/spring-security/site/reference/html/domain-acls
when it should point to:
http://static.springframework.org/spring-security/site/reference/html/domain-acls.html
It seems the typo is that in https://src.springframework.org/svn/spring-security/trunk/src/docbkx/appendix-db-schema.xml , 
xlink:href="domain-acls" should be xlink:href="#domain-acls"
