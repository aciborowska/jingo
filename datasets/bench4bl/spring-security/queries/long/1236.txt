With this configuration the URLs with /user/** pattern does not get intercepted:
<http>
	<http-basic/>
	<intercept-url pattern="/user/**" access="ROLE_USER"/>
	<intercept-url pattern="/teller/**" access="ROLE_TELLER" method="GET"/>
</http>
this is beacause org.springframework.security.web.access.intercept.DefaultFilterInvocationSecurityMetadataSource never search for null key.
Here is the current code:
 Map<Object, List<ConfigAttribute>> requestMap = httpMethodMap.get(method);
 // If no method-specific map, use the general one stored under the null key
 if (requestMap == null) 
{
   requestMap = httpMethodMap.get(null);
 }

Because "method" is never "null", in the first line the variable "requestMap" will either, so the "if"'s condition is never "true".
Attached is a working version of the class.
