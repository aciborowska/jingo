We've started using SpEL expressions to avoid duplicating URL patterns between security.xml and our MVC controller mappings.
E.g.






<form-login 




    login-page="#{T(com.acme.Sitemap).LOGIN}" 




    authentication-failure-url="#{T(com.acme.Sitemap).AUTH_ERROR}"/>






Now we keep seeing spurious warnings like






FailFastProblemReporter - Configuration problem: #{ T(com.acme.Sitemap).AUTH_ERROR} is not a valid redirect URL (must start with '/' or http(s))






This appears to be caused by WebConfigUtils.validateHttpRedirect() which checks for a '$' placeholder character but not for a '#' SpEL character.
