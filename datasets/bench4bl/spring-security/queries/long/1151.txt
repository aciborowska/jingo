On line 130 of AclImpl.java in trunk (line number is different in other releases) a check is performed on the upper bound of the list of access control entries.
Code is:
        if (aceIndex > this.aces.size()) {
should be:
        if (aceIndex >= this.aces.size()) {
Result is that exception out of underlying list impl is thrown.  Minor.
