Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but is there a reason that after a successful login (using the <form-login /> approach) the "credentials" from login (the user's password) are kept in clear text in the Authentication object stored in the SecurityContext?
After login, any part of my application can simply do:
<code>SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthenticati on().getCredentials();</code>
This returns the plain-text password supplied at login, even if login was dozens of requests ago. Why is this? Does that not seem somewhat insecure to anyone else?
