GlobalMethodSecurityConfiguration has two typos:

method setMethodSecurityExpressionHandler logs a message "Not autwiring PermissionEvaluator since size != 1". However, there are no PermissionEvaluators involved. Instead, method handles MethodSecurityExpressionHandler, which may lead to confusing log message. Furthermore, there is a typo in the message
method setPermissionEvaluator logs a message with a typo "Not autwiring PermissionEvaluator since size != 1".
