Implementing a ldapAuthentication into my Spring Security configuration makes the process ignoring the boolean field : "enabled" on Users (org.springframework.security.core.userdetails) so it's allowing disabled Users to connect..
The Security Config works well and it disallow disabled Users to connect with a simple authentication using userDetailsService but it fails with ldapAuthentication.
And implementing a custom userDetailsContextMapper doesn't work too.
Is this a normal behavior ?
