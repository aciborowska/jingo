When using the RemoteAuthenticationProvider, on the server-side the AuthenticationException is repackaged into a less verbose RemoteAuthenticationException (see RemoteAuthenticationManagerImpl), presumbly in order not to accidentally expose any critical information.
Once the result has reached the client side, the exception is simply passed on though. Since the RemoteAuthenticationException is not a subclass of AuthenticationException it falls through in every following catch block, eventually hitting the uncaught exception handler of the servlet.
