I submitted this via the listserv on 7/21/2005, and one of the developers said it would be looked into immediately, so I didnt file a JIRA issue on it, but since it apparently hasn't been touched in CVS, I'm going to submit it here.  I'm pasting in the email contents below:
I'm also going to submit a patch, which is my version of the fix.
================================
I'll double check but I'm pretty sure that's a bug. If so I'll get it committed either tonight or tomorrow. US time that is  -Ray
