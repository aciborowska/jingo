I was seeing extremely odd behaviour in one of my applications while adding in a secure section where the application was calling my custom AuthenticationProvider service and authenticating but the app would loose the authentication information when I try to navigate to one of the secure areas. The app would get stuck in redirect loops after a successful login via my custom login page.
In the end this was caused by the framework not knowing about the Authentication Provider. After a long time of trying things such as managing the Authentication object in the session etc, I found out that this is logged as a 1 liner DEBUG statement.
This should at the minimal be logged as an ERROR or I'd argue even as far as a FATAL and throw a stack trace out. This was a hidden problem because the framework knew there wasn't an authentication provider yet I had security rules setup for authentication.
Just to clarify, this bug is to the change the visibility of this error statement. The fix of the actual problem was obviously add in the authentication provider so the framework is aware of it as well.
