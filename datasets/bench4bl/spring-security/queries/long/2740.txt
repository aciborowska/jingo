All 5 of the unit test methods that are supposed to verify an auth exception  is thrown are failing (no exception is thrown):






sample.aspectj.AspectJInterceptorTests > testSecuredClassNotAuthenticated FAILED




    java.lang.AssertionError




 




sample.aspectj.AspectJInterceptorTests > testSecuredClassWrongRole FAILED




    java.lang.AssertionError




 




sample.aspectj.AspectJInterceptorTests > testSecuredMethodWrongRole FAILED




    java.lang.AssertionError




 




sample.aspectj.AspectJInterceptorTests > testSecuredClassWrongRoleOnNewedInstance FAILED




    java.lang.AssertionError




 




sample.aspectj.AspectJInterceptorTests > testSecuredMethodNotAuthenticated FAILED




    java.lang.AssertionError




 




8 tests completed, 5 failed




:spring-security-samples-aspectj-xml:test FAILED






I run this on the latest head (24dec7e) but it seems to be old as a7005bd from 7 months ago failed as well.
