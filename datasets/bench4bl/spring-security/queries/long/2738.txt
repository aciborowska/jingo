with the following configuration:






users-by-username-query="select 22 as age, true as enabled, email as username, password from user where email=?"




authorities-by-username-query="select 22 as age, true as enabled, email as username, authority as role from user where email=?"/>






I'll get a 'Bad credentials' response and the db sql log will be 






BST LOG:  execute <unnamed>: select 22 as age, true as enabled, email as username, password from consumer where email=$1




BST DETAIL:  parameters: $1 = 'user@mail.com'




BST LOG:  execute <unnamed>: select 22 as age, true as enabled, email as username, authority as role from consumer where email=$1




BST DETAIL:  parameters: $1 = '22'






While in the users-by-username-query case it passes the value of the email field in the parameter, in the case of the authorities-by-username-query it passes the value of the first field of the query in the parameter
