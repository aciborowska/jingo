I checked the bug exists in the latest revision on GitHub.
These classes:

org.springframework.security.web.access.channel.AbstractRetryEntryPoint
org.springframework.security.web.authentication.LoginUrlAuthenticationEntryPoint
org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.HttpSessionRequestCache

all create a default instance of PortResolverImpl.
PortResolverImpl creates a default instance of PortMapper.
When I configure a custom instance of PortMapper in my application, it does not propagate to these PortResolvers, which are extensively used by classes in question.
