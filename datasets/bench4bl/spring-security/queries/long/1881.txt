The following tests are not ran in the 3.0.x branch since the parent pom only includes tests ending with Tests.java.
./taglibs/src/test/java/org/springframework/security/taglibs/velocity/AuthzImplAttributeTest.java
./taglibs/src/test/java/org/springframework/security/taglibs/velocity/AuthzImplAuthorizeTagTest.java
./web/src/test/java/org/springframework/security/web/authentication/DelegatingAuthenticationEntryPointTest.java
./web/src/test/java/org/springframework/security/web/authentication/DelegatingAuthenticationEntryPointContextTest.java
./web/src/test/java/org/springframework/security/web/util/ELRequestMatcherTest.java
./core/src/test/java/org/springframework/security/remoting/dns/JndiDnsResolverTest.java
./core/src/test/java/org/springframework/security/core/authority/mapping/MapBasedAttributes2GrantedAuthoritiesMapperTest.java
The tests should be renamed to end with Tests and the parent pom should be updated to include tests ending with Test to prevent this mistake from happening again. Note that some of these tests that are skipped actually fail.
