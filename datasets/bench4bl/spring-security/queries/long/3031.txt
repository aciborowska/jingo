When an ExecutorService (ThreadPoolExecutor) is setup with a CallerRunsPolicy for the RejectedExecutionHandler and the caller thread is used to run the task, the spring security DelegatingSecurityContextCallable and DelegatingSecurityContextRunnable blindly clear the security context upon completion - effectively clearing the security context for the calling thread.  In this case, it should not clear the context.
