yielded a little problem with PortMappingImpl.  The javadocs state that use the following in a spring config file
   <property name="httpsPortMapping">
     <map>
       <entry key="80"><value>443</value></entry>
       <entry key="8080"><value>8443</value></entry>
     </map>
   </property>
Looking into the source of PortMappingImpl and there's no corresponding setHttpsPortMapping for spring to inject.  Spring falls over.  
Solution : either update the javadocs or better in my opinion change the existing method from setPortMapping(Map m) to setHttpsPortMapping(Map m)
