I found an error in the current documentation. Under section "3.5.3. LDAP Authentication" first paragraph is a link to an example. This link contains a typing error. 
The link points to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/tree/master/samples/lda-jc
korrekt is https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/tree/master/samples/ldad-jc
