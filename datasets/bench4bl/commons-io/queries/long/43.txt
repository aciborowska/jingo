public static String getExtension( String filename) {
    int index = filename.lastIndexOf('.');
    if (-1 == index) 
{
        return "";
    }
 else 
{
        return filename.substring(index + 1);
    }
}
is too simplistic.
It will not handle paths in the form "/path.to/file" at all well.  It will
return "to/file" as the extension which is incorrect.  The file extension is "".
removeExtension falls into a similar trap.
Perhaps it was the poor quality of these functions that caused FilenameUtils to
be removed from the 1.0 release?
