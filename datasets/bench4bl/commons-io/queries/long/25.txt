LockableFileWriter can lock the file such that it can't be deleted due to the
sequence of events in the constructor (no test).
LockableFileWriter loses the lock after the first attempt to break the lock
(test case error).
LockableFileWriter can create a file then fail and not delete the file in the
constructor (no test).
