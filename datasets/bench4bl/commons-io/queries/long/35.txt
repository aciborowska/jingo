Attached please find an updated version of FileSystemUtils (because of some 
issues at my current location I am unable to create a patch... don't ask!)
This addresses the two outstanding issues that would keep this from being 
included in the next release, namely:
(1) Wouldn't work on "alternate" (depending on your perspective I suppose!) 
language versions of Windows... I do not have anything other than an English 
version to test this on, so it'd be great it someone else could.  It does NOT 
look for any particular string any longer though, so I expect it to work.  
Certainly it does on my test platforms.  The Windows implementation is fairly 
different than it was because of this.
(2) Using cmd.exe on *nix systems... still don't know why I wrote it like that 
in the first place, or why it worked on my test Linux instances, but in any 
case it doesn't use it any more, it uses df directly as it should have been 
all along.
I also addressed a couple of Checkstyle complaints with regard to line 
lengths.  Nothing major.
