As already discussed a bit on IO-125 and related to https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/MVNCENTRAL-244:
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/commons/commons-io/1.3.2/commons-io-1.3.2.pom has a incorrect groupId commons-io, Artifactory e.g. complains about this.
AFAIS the artifacts at org/apache/commons have the same checksums as those at commons-io. As a workaround I deployed a relocation POM https://raw.github.com/gist/3832570/ac0c2503cea5e8642035eae0904fab4ad2fb74f3/commons-io-1.3.2.pom in a repository which is searched before central in my Artifactory instance.
