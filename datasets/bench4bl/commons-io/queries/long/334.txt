The toFiles method treats null input the same as an empty array, however the toURLs method throws NPE for null input.
This is inconsistent.
The Javadoc for toURLs does not specify the behaviour for null input.
Either the method should be fixed to treat null as an empty array, or the NPE should be documented.
