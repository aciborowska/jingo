testCopy_byteArrayToWriter() has the following code:



ByteArrayOutputStream baout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

OutputStream out = new YellOnFlushAndCloseOutputStream(baout, false, true); // out is not used

Writer writer = new java.io.OutputStreamWriter(baout, "US-ASCII"); // uses baout - should it use out instead



It looks like the Writer should be created from out rather than baout - otherwise why create out?
Similarly for
testCopy_inputStreamToWriter()
testCopy_readerToWriter()
testCopy_stringToWriter()
The tests still pass if the Writer is changed to use out.
Thoughts?
