Consider the following:



File fooDir = new File("/temp/foo");

File fooFile = new File("/temp/foo.txt");

FileUtils.directoryContains(fooDir, fooFile); // returns true, should return false



fooFile is a sibling of fooDir.  fooDir does not contain fooFile.
This is due to the way FilenameUtils.directoryContains is implemented in that this method uses a simple 'startsWith' comparison.  A related bug is filed for the FilenameUtils method that I believe should be fixed as well.
