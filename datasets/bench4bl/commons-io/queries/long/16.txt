Env: Java 1.4.2, commons-io-1.0.jar, Win XP
The AbstractFileFilter's FilenameFilter's accept(File, String) method 
implementation constructs the fileName/File (it passes to accept(File)) 
wrongly - please see below. This causes the DirectoryFileFilter (in example, I 
did not have time to check out the other AbstractFileFilter implementations) 
failure since it's FileFilter implementation receives the incorrect 
filename/File. 
Note I stumbled into this in Win Env. and really don't know how it works in 
other platforms.
v1.0 code:
    public boolean accept(File dir, String name) 
{
        String filename = dir.getName() + File.separator + name;
        return accept(new File(filename));
    }

correct code should be:
    public boolean accept(File dir, String name) 
{
        String filename = dir.getPath() + File.separator + name;
        return accept(new File(filename));
    }
