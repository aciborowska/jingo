The commons-io POM contains a resource section, which specifies that the NOTICE.txt and LICENSE.txt files are being added to the jar files META-INF directory. Unfortunately, this triggers MSOURCES-6, a well known bug in the maven-sources-plugin, which attempts to include the base directory into the source jar file. The base directory includes the sources jar itself, which is growing while it is being included into itself, which is growing while it is included into itself, ...
In other words, the maven-sources-plugin is creating a jar file endleseely.
When deploying the commons-io with
    mvn -Prc commons-io deploy
or
   mvn -Prelease commons-io deploy
then the maven-sources-plugin is invoked by the commons-parent POM. In other words, the commons-io jar file cannot be deployed.
The attached patch removes the resources section from the commons-parent POM: This can easily be done, because the commons-parent POM is already addressing this by invoking the antrun plugin.
