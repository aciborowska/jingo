The method makeCVSAware(IOFileFilter) in FileFilterUtils returns IOFileFilter 
that ignores CVS directories. But this IOFileFilter also ignores normal files. 
only accepts directories.
I think it should accept files and directories except directories named "CVS".
I will send a path for this problem, so please see that about details.
