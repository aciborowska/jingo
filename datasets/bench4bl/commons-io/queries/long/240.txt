FileFilterUtils lazily creates the static fields cvsFilter and svnFilter; however access to the fields is not synchronized and the fields are not volatile.
One thread can create the filter, but the updated value won't necessarily be seen by any/all other threads.
This means that the fields can be created multiple times.
Possible solutions: make the fields volatile, or use the singleton IODH idiom. The latter uses a bit more code, but is probably marginally cheaper if the field is used a lot.
