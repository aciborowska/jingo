There are currently no tests for the available() method.
Tme method should return an estimate of the number of items remaining, so it should be possible to read - or skip - that many items without reaching EOF.
At present, the code measures the number of CharBuf entries remaining; I think that is wrong - it should be the number of bytes left in the byte stream.
