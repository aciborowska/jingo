listFilesAndDirs seems to always include the "directory" passed as input in it's resulting Collection.  This is unexpected given the docs for the method...
Finds files within a given directory (and optionally its subdirectories). All files found are filtered by an IOFileFilter. 

the "given directory" is not a subdirectory of itself
it is not subjected to the IOFileFilter dirFilter, it is always added.
