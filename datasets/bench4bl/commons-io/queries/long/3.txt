File copying using FileUtils.copyFile() does not preserve the last modified 
date in the copy. I'm not sure about other OS's, but preservation of the last 
modified date occurs when copying from Windows Explorer or the command window 
in a Windows environment. To add this feature to the class, just add the 
following line at the end of FileUtils.copyFile():
      destination.setLastModified(source.lastModified());
To unit test this change, add the following to the end of 
FileUtilsTestCase.testCopyFile1() and/or testCopyFile2():
        assertTrue("Check last modified date preserved", testFile1.lastModified
() == destination.lastModified());
