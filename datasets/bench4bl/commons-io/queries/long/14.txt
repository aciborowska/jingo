In the function freeSpaceWindows of the class FileSystemUtils, the command use is 
dir /c (with thousand separator) instead of dir /-c (without thousand 
separator) as state in the documentation : see line 166.
This is a problem for French locale where the thousand separator is the SPACE
character.
Thanks for this great package !!!
