The following JUnit test cases fail when running on Windows 2000 (JDK 1.4.2_05)
      FileFilterTestCase
      FileUtilsFileNewerTestCase
According to the java.io.File javadoc for the setLastModified() method "All 
platforms support file-modification times to the nearest second, but some 
provide more precision"
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/File.html#setLastModified(long)
1) FileFilterTestCase's testAgeFilter() method appears to be failing because 
the lastModified date is being rounded up to the nearest second - but the spin
() method is only waiting until the system time is later. I'm attaching a patch 
so that the spin() method waits until the system time is after the modification 
date/time of the file.
2) FileUtilsFileNewerTestCase seems to have a couple of problems:

The testIsFileNewer() method appears to be failing because calling
setLastModified() seems to be rounding up to the nearest two seconds, so the 
check on the temporary file lastModified time after it has been set fails. 
Changing testIsFileNewer() to use two seconds rather than one resolves this and 
I found the following bug which appears to back this up:

The testIsFileNewerImaginaryFile() method appears to be failing because
setting the lastModified to zero seems to be ignored. This is also mentioned in 
the above bug. Passing the actual temporary file's modifiedDate rather than 
zero resolves this.
