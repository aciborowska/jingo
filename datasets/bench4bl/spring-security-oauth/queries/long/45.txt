OAuth2ClientBeanDefinitionParser passes in an incorrect string when trying to parse the requireAuthenticated attribute. Currently it looks for the string "requireAuthenticated", which is incorrect as the schema (spring-security-oauth2-1.0.xsd) defines the string as "require-authenticated".
With this bug, specifying <oauth:client require-authenticated="false" /> does nothing.
This requires a simple fix, just change the string it's looking for in element.getAttribute() in OAuth2ClientBeanDefinitionParser.
