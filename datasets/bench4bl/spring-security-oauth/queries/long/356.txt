If the client requests a compound scope set such as [a, b, c] from the server, they do so using a space-separated string, "a b c". On first load, this is properly parsed by the OAuth2Utils class and stored in the AuthorizationRequest object as a set of [a, b, c]. However, upon pulling the AuthorizationRequest object out of the session, the scope is stored as a single string, "a b c" as opposed to the set of [a, b, c]. This makes any late-binding scoping calculations, such as whether or not to issue id_tokens or other claims in OpenID Connect, fail because the scope in the stored Request no longer matches the expected scope.
