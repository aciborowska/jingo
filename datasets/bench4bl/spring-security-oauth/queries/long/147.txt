When using implicit grant the authorization server redirects to the user-agent without expires_in header.
From the required parameters only the access_token is returned.
The expires_in parameter is optional, does this mean the access_token will not expire?
expires_in
OPTIONAL. The lifetime in seconds of the access token. For
example, the value "3600" denotes that the access token will
expire in one hour from the time the response was generated.
