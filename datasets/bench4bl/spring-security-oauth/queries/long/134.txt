Hi,
We are facing a little regression that is probably related to SECOAUTH-110 (Make it easier to separate authorization service from resource service features).
Based on org.springframework.security.oauth2.provider.filter.OAuth2AuthorizationFilter that seems to have now gone away, our system uses token endpoint URLs that have the pattern /6/oauth/token, where /6 represents the api version of the system that we internally use to adjust the behavior for clients using different api(s). This worked well for us because org.springframework.security.web.authentication.AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter#requiresAuthentication() used to do a endsWith match - uri.endsWith(request.getContextPath() + filterProcessesUrl)
However, now EndpointValidationFilter#matches() seems to be doing a more restrictive match - (uri.equals(contextPath)) - which breaks the previous behaviour for us.
