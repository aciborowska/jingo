The error is "Access could not be granted. (The client authentication hasn't been approved by the current user.)"
It appeared after switching to spring-security-web-3.0.3.RELEASE.
The reason is that when a user is redirected to the login page, the UnapprovedClientAuthenticationException is thrown which is then stored in SimpleUrlAuthenticationFailureHandler.onAuthenticationFailure() - line 60, which was not the case in 3.0.2
