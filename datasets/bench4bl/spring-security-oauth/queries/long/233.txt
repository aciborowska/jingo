If you pass an invalid access token to an API, Spring library tries to return the error in two ways:
1.       It returns error information in the WWW-Authenticate response header.
2.       It attempts to return a JSON error in the response body.
Now, if the Accept header was set to 'application/xml' only, then Spring will fail to render the JSON response body as XML and will return 406 instead of 401.
IMHO, this is a bug in the Spring implementation. According to the bearer spec, the response body is actually optional. If it's going to return one anyway, then it should respect the Accept header.
