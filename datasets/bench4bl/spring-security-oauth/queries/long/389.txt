The 1.0.0 release JAR in the Spring repository is not the same as the one in Maven central. Specifically, the following URLs do not respond with the same file:
 http://maven.springframework.org/release/org/springframework/security/oauth/spring-security-oauth2/1.0.0.RELEASE/spring-security-oauth2-1.0.0.RELEASE.jar
 http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/springframework/security/oauth/spring-security-oauth2/1.0.0.RELEASE/spring-security-oauth2-1.0.0.RELEASE.jar
The JAR in the Spring repository appears to be wrong, because it does not include revision 99aa002. Note the different package names in the following:
$ curl -s http://maven.springframework.org/release/org/springframework/security/oauth/spring-security-oauth2/1.0.0.RELEASE/spring-security-oauth2-1.0.0.RELEASE.jar | jar t | grep UserRedirectRequiredException
org/springframework/security/oauth2/client/UserRedirectRequiredException.class
$ curl -s http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/springframework/security/oauth/spring-security-oauth2/1.0.0.RELEASE/spring-security-oauth2-1.0.0.RELEASE.jar | jar t | grep UserRedirectRequiredException
org/springframework/security/oauth2/client/resource/UserRedirectRequiredException.class
