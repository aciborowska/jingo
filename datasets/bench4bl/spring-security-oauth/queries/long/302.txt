TokenStore retrieval can fail if an AuthorizationRequestFactory has changed the storage key.  The AuthorizationRequestFactory can modify the key used to store a token downstream of the OAuth2 endpoints, so any attempt to retrieve an existing token from those endpoints would fail.  Not a big deal for the token endpoint, but the authorization endpoint will force users to re-approve the grant.
