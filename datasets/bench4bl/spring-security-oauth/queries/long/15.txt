If I start Tonr 2 and click "facebook stuff" before logging in I sometimes get 404.
I'm sure under what circumstances this occurs but the redirect sometimes leads to /tonr2/facebook/index.jsp instead of /tonr2/facebook/info.jsp. It might have something to do with the fact that applicationContext.xml:19 default-target-url="/index.jsp" ...???
