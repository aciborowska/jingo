<oauth:rest-template/> uses same context for all requests in the same user session.  Because of the way that the scoped proxies are created in the parser (the bean definitions are never registered) so they override each other and only one is ever instantiated per session/request.  Easy to fix, hard to test, but easy to verify manually by visiting facebook and sparklr pages in tonr2 in same session (breaks and the message shows that the wrong access token is being used).
