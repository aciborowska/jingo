When authenticating against a provider (twitter, for example), if authentication fails, then the user of the consuming application will be signed out.
This seems to be because OAuthRequstFailedException is a type of AuthenticationException and because it isn't caught within SS-OAuth. It flows out to Spring Security's filters and, since it is an AuthenticationException, Spring Security assumes that authentication failed and invalidates the session.
