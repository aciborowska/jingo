docs/oauth2.md says:

The OAuth2ExceptionHandlerFilter is used to handle any errors.
Looks to me like the class org.springframework.security.oauth2.provider.filter.OAuth2ExceptionHandlerFilter was removed some time between M6 and RC1, but this oauth2 guide still refers to it.
I have an app that was using M6 and extended OAuth2ExceptionHandlerFilter to customize the response when a certain type of RuntimeException was encountered. What is the proper class to extend in 1.0.0 and beyond to customize the response in this scenario?
