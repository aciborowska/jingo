I have the full repo from github (as of https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-security-oauth/commit/33acf01dccc563c184f897448d7d61ed4aa847ff) and everything builds fine. When I run sparklr2 under Tomcat 6, everything goes fine up until I log in. Then the page displays fine, but the images don't display. Refreshing the page when already authenticated gives the full log stack in the attached sparklr2fail.log.
The trouble seems to start with the call to URL: /photos?callback=pictureDisplay&format=json. At that point (or really soon thereafter), I get this error:






sparklr2 12:04:12.986 [DEBUG] ExceptionTranslationFilter - Authentication exception occurred; redirecting to authentication entry point <org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException: An Authentication object was not found in the SecurityContext>org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException: An Authentication object was not found in the SecurityContext






Which is interesting because the authentication object HAD been previously found, e.g.:






sparklr2 12:04:12.985 [DEBUG] FilterSecurityInterceptor - Previously Authenticated: org.springframework.security.authentication.UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken@89e4426a: Principal: org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User@32053f56: Username: marissa; Password: [PROTECTED]; Enabled: true; AccountNonExpired: true; credentialsNonExpired: true; AccountNonLocked: true; Granted Authorities: ROLE_USER; Credentials: [PROTECTED]; Authenticated: true; Details: org.springframework.security.web.authentication.WebAuthenticationDetails@fffc7f0c: RemoteIpAddress: 127.0.0.1; SessionId: 7B0ED154A3733DF5FD128184AF859EA0; Granted Authorities: ROLE_USER






The pictures are viewable after you log into tonr2 and OAuth into sparklr2.
Note that this is different from the issues I had a while back relating to the Accept header. This is affecting all browsers with which I've tested the app. I've tried both users defined in the security configuration and the same error occurs.
Let me know if I can provide you with any other context or information.
