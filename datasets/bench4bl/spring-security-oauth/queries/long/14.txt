Context: I'm testing the Facebook integration in Tonr 2.
When I revoke (i.e. remove) the permissions given to Tonr in Facebook after I authenticated successfully once in Tonr I get an exception. context.getAccessTokens() at OAuth2ClientHttpRequestFactory:41 returns null in this case.
I need to remove the JSESSIONID cookie first (or to kill the session some other way) to force a new session being created.
Steps to reproduce:

deploy Tonr 2
log into Tonr 2
click the "facebook stuff" menu item (which should really be called "facebook friends")
allow Tonr 2 to access the request information in Facebook
see Facebook friends list
in Facebook: remove the Tonr 2 application
in Tonr 2: click the "facebook stuff" link again -> org.springframework.web.client.HttpClientErrorException: 400 Bad Request
