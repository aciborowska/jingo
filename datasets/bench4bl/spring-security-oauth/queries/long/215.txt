The xsd file included in the jar for 1.0.0.M6 changes the name of an attribute on the <authorization-code> element.  The name used to be seervices-ref and was changed to authorization-code-services-ref.  The corresponding parsing code was not changed to look for the new attribute name, so when config using the new name is used, the value of the authorization-code-services-ref is ignored and the code instantiates an in-memory service instead.
