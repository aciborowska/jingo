When a bad username/password is supplied to the "password" grant type, a BadCredentialsException is thrown by the TokenEndpoint. It does not return a correct OAuth 2 error response.
The exception is thrown by the authentication manager, which is called by ResourceOwnerPasswordTokenGranter without catching any exceptions (line 110):






Authentication userAuth = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password);




userAuth = authenticationManager.authenticate(userAuth);






The exception needs to be wrapped in an InvalidGrantException, so the correct error response (invalid_grant, status 400) can be returned.
