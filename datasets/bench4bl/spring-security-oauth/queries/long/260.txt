When starting the tonr2 web application you will get the following error. Look at the attachment for the full stack trace.
Caused by: org.springframework.beans.NotWritablePropertyException: Invalid property 'messageConverters' of bean class [org.springframework.security.oauth2.config.OAuth2RestTemplateFactoryBean]: Bean property 'messageConverters' is not writable or has an invalid setter method. Does the parameter type of the setter match the return type of the getter?
The problem appears to have been caused when SECOAUTH-28 modified the spring-servlet.xml to use the following.
<oauth:rest-template resource="facebook">
I am not sure if the intent of rest-template is to allow for this type of customization or if this example (facebook) should be doing it the old way. Either way if you let me know how you would like it to behave I could provide a patch.
