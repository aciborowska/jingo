Hi,
We use spring-security-web and spring-security-oauth2 and are having an issue related to refresh_token requests (oauth/token?grant_type=refresh_token)
For such requests, RefreshAuthenticationProvider creates an OAuth2Authentication instance that contains an instance of RefreshTokenDetails.
Now, we use HTTP session clustering that is backed by Hazelcast and when SecurityContextPersistenceFilter saves the security context (authentication object in the session against the key "SPRING_SECURITY_CONTEXT"), Hazelcast rejects it because the authentication object is non-serializable overall.
I am attaching a screenshot for reference.
