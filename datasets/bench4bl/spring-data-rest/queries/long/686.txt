The message source created in RepositoryRestMvcConfiguration.resourceDescriptionMessageSourceAccessor does not support property files with UTF8 symbols (e.g. cyrillic alphabet ). Resource descriptions come out as garbage.
Other Spring message sources have no such problem.
That is easily fixed by adding messageSource.setDefaultEncoding("UTF-8");.
