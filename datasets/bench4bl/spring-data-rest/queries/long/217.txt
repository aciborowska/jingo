When a @RestResource(exported = false) annotation is placed against the appropriate (highest level of functionality) findAll(â€¦) method, all entities are still shown in the REST JSON response.
Example:






@Override




@RestResource(exported = false)




Page<Person> findAll(Pageable pageable);
