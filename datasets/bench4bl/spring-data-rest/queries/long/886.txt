There is a TODO in line 126 of org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.json.patch.JsonPatchPatchConverter pointing out that patching array values is not supported yet.
As a result when you try to patch a collection-based property, Spring Data REST will instead set the value to null.
Take, for example, this request:






[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/hello", "value": ["world","galaxy"] }]







I would expect either...

a proper implementation (preferred  )
nothing, but a warning on the server side that this operation was ignored
an unsupported operation exception indicating the client that his request was rejected
