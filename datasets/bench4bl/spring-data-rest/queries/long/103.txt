Currently only repositories implementing CrudRepository can be used with Spring Data REST. Spring Data Commons now also exposes non-CrudRepository instances.
We should rewrite the repository invocation parts to detect the CRUD methods necessary on the repository and provide a generic API to invoke these methods from clients without having to worry about pagination, id conversion etc.
We also should treat CrudRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository as special cases and try to work around the reflection calls generally necessary for custom repositories.
