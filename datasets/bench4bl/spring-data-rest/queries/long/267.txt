When loading an entity with via id, the response always contains the a self link like this 






http://localhost:8080/web/entity/5319f06c804c618fc7e6cf73{?projection}






When using a HATEOAS approach based solution for entity handling I would to a PUT on self.
This leads to a put with:






http://localhost:8080/web/entity/5319f06c804c618fc7e6cf73{?projection}






which in turns leads to a:






URI::InvalidURIError: bad URI(is not URI?): http://localhost:8080/web/agentInstances/5319f06c804c618fc7e6cf73{?projection}






That's a bit messy I think and could be improved.
