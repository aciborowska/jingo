In my application and in the example application the @JsonIgnore annotation is ignored.
Reproduce:
Add an @JsonIgnore annotation to the field status in Order.java. The status field should not be serialized.
Call http://localhost:8080/restbucks/orders/1
The status property is (still) exported.
Also tried @JsonIgnoreProperties and @XmlTransient, no effect.
Additionally, i am not able to find another way to exclude a property.
