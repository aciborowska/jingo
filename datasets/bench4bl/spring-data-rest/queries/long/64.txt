RepositoryEntityController sets the HTTP status code to 201 Created. Nevertheless, the response returned is 200 OK. I am assuming this is due to the fact that the status code is buried in the JsonResponse return value but cannot be set in the according HttpMessageConverter. 
I assume this is triggered as jsonpCreateNewEntity(â€¦) of the RepositoryEntityController is consuming application/json, which it probably shouldn't and rather consume application/javascript.
