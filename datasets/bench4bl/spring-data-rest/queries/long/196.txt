Hi guys,
you can read about my problem here:
http://forum.spring.io/forum/data-rest/722865-differences-between-spring-data-1-1-m1-and-2-0-0-build-snapshot
But to summarize I use spring-data-rest, which internally calls spring-data-commons to load my repositories for export. My problem is that spring-data-commons loads ALL my repositories. And I have a common base repository which looks like this:






public interface BaseEntityRepository<T, PK extends Serializable> extends Repository<T, PK> {




Â 




    /**




     * Retrieves an entity by its UID.




     * 




     * @param uid




     * @return




     */




    T findByUidEquals(@Param("uid") final String uid);




}






and as you can see T is of type java.lang.Object so Spring-data-rest complains that it is not a mapped hibernate type. Fair enough, I tried to specify it not to be exported, using: 






@RestResource(exported = false)






but this had no effect. So my question is: how can I exclude my base repository from being exported as rest?
Thank you.
