When attempting to apply AOP proxying to an overriden findOne(ID) method, the proxied method is not called.
Example:






@Override




@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('ROLE_ADMIN')")




PurchaseOrder findOne(PurchaseOrderPK pk);






The problem is due to the base class 'findOne(Serializable id)' method being called instead of the more specific, covariant version.
Although the obvious solution is to simply override the 'findOne(Serializable id)' method and place an annotation on in it instead, this does not completely solve the issue. There are cases where it is desirable to overload the more specific version such as when one is using a spEL expression in an annotation and referring to a composite key, for example:






@Override




@PreAuthorize("#pk.getUserId() == authentication.id")




PurchaseOrder findOne(@Param("pk") PurchaseOrderPK pk);






The issue is specific to CrudRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository derived repositories.
