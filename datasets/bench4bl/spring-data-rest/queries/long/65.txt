Whenever the server renders JSONP eventually, no ResourceProcessor beans are invoked. Steps to reproduce:
1. git clone https://github.com/olivergierke/spring-restbucks.git
2. git checkout sd-rest-next
3. mvn jetty:run
4. curl http://localhost:8080/orders -> JSONP is rendered by default
5. Representation only contains the self link
6. curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/orders -> JSON is rendered
7. Representation contains additional links
