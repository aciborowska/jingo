In Spring Boot 1.3.0.M5, i'm using Spring Data Rest 2.4.0 RELEASE @RepositoryEventHandler. Below is the code snippet, when i try to findOne currentSomething somehow the result is same as updatedSomething, but this change is not already commited in database. Can anyone explain what happened? because i didnt face this issue in Spring Boot 1.3.0.M2






@Configuration




@RepositoryEventHandler(Something.class)




public class VehicleEventHandler {




 




    @Autowired




    private SomethingRepository somethingRepository;




 




    @HandleBeforeSave




    public void handleBeforeSave(Something updatedSomething) {




         Something currentSomething = somethingRepository.findOne(currentSomething.getSomethingId());




        if (!currentSomething.getPlateNumber().equals(updatedSomething.getPlateNumber())) {




            SomethingLogService.saveLog(updatedSomething);




        }




    }




}
