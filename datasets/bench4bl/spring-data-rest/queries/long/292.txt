With 2.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT, I built a demo app to demonstrate hypermedia. In order to mix it with web pages, I reconfigured the baseUri to /api by extending RestRepositoryMvConfiguration and using the configureRepositoryRestConfiguration method to set baseUri.
The hypermedia links showed /api embedded at the front of each URI, but it still responded to the existing paths.
