When using PUT method, removing any field appears to be interpreted as "no change".
This seems to be close to the expected behavior of PATCH method, not PUT.
Example:
Step 1 GET /objects/o1  
{ "f1":"v1", "f2":"v2"}
Step 2 PUT /objects/o1  
{ "f1":"v1"}
Step 3 GET /objects/o1  
{ "f1":"v1", "f2":"v2"}

(it seems that the result should be 
{ "f1":"v1"}
)
