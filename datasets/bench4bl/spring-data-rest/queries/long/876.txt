I'm trying to fetch "golden" copy of record from DB while validating the entity to check passed field being unique.  Since I cannot change the DB structure to enforce this with annotation, I had to pass repository reference into validator with expected result of being able to refetch the record. 
Here is the link to s sample project that reproduces the issue:
