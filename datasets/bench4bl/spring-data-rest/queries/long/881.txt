There is a regression from SDR 2.4 to 2.5 where ResourceProcessors are not invoked for CrudRepositories but are invoked for JpaRepositories. I have provided an example project with tests. You can switch between Spring Boot 1.3 and 1.4 in the build script.
We think we traced the issue down to line 154 in ResourceProcessorHandlerMethodReturnValueHandler where it checks if Resources can be assigned from the targetType. It appears that in the CrudRepository case, where findAll returns a Resources<T>, the isAssignableFrom implementation from Spring Core is returning false where as in the JpaRepository case findAll returns a PagedResources<T> and isAssignableFrom returns true. I feel like both of these scenarios should return true for the ResourceProcessor logic to work as expected.
