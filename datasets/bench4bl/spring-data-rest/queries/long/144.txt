Although it is possible to disable the CUD parts of the CRUDRepsoitory by adding @exported(false) to overloaded methods of the CRUDRepository i think it would be nicer to see either:
The Introduction to a read only repository in the spring-data-commons ie:






java




@NoRepositoryBean




public interface ReadOnlyRepository<T, ID extends Serializable> extends Repository<T, ID> {




	T findOne(ID id);




	List<T> findAll();




	List<T> findAll(Sort sort);




	Page<T> findAll(Pageable pageable);




}






Which can be used as the decoration point when using spring-data-rest-webmvc instead of CRUDRepository (although I imagine a CRUDRepository would inherit from such a class)
or
Have the spring-data-rest-webmvc decorate any Repository based interface and follow some sort of expected method signatures for providing the appropriate Get/Put/Post/Patch/Delete REST operations.
