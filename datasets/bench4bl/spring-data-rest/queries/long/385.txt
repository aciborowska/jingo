Hello,
I'm having the following MapedSuperclass which is a base class for all my entities:






 




@MappedSuperclass




public abstract class AbstractEntityModel {




 




    @Column(name = "id", nullable = false)




    private String uid = java.util.UUID.randomUUID().toString();




}




 






and I have created a Projection for it in the same package:






@Projection(name = "basic", types = { AbstractEntityModel.class })




public interface BasicEntityModelProjection {




 




    public String getUid();




}






Unfortunately when I navigate to the /rest url I don't see the projection in the generated URLs of my entities.
