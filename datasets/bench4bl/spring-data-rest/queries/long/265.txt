POST/Create with Non-CRUD Repository doesn't actually save (only checks exists()).
Sample:






NonCrudRepository.java






public interface NonCrudRepository extends Repository<CreditCard, Long> {




Â 




    CreditCard findByCreditCardNumber(String creditCardNumber);




    CreditCard save(CreditCard creditCard);




    Iterable<CreditCard> save(Iterable<CreditCard> entities);




    CreditCard findOne(Long id);




    boolean exists(Long id);




}






I turned on hibernate sql debug logging and observed that it seems to call exists() since it does an SQL SELECT statement, but not the INSERT and final SELECT statement.
I couldn't figure out a unit / integration test yet, but if necessary can try to cook something.
