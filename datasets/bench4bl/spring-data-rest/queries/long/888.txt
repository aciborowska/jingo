Previously date fields rendered as a string (eg, "2016-07-12T17:58:43.643Z") in 1.3.7. With the 1.4.0 release, they now are rendered as an object with a content field (eg, 
{ content: "2016-07-12T17:58:43.643Z" }
).
I have created an example project (modified from the Spring example project) demonstrating this behavior:
https://github.com/robmoore/gs-accessing-mongodb-data-rest
The main branch has the 1.4.0 version with a supporting test and the spring-1.3.7 branch has an example of the previous behavior with a supporting test. 
It seems like the date property is being treated as a resource by mistake.
