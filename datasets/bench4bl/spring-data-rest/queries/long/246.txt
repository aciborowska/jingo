ValidatingRepositoryEventListener uses field injection to access a Repositories instance and does a by-type lookup of components in afterPropertiesSet(â€¦) which can cause a circular reference on initialization.
We should rather use an ObjectFactory<Repositories> from within the listener so that the container can give us a proxy that will eventually return the Repositories instance but doesn't have to instantiate Repositories eagerly.
