ResourceSupportHttpMessageConverter does not implement canRead(Type, Class<?>, MediaType) which causes the converter being considered for types that don't match the configured one. There is a downstream ticket in Spring HATEOAS but we should also fix that locally for maintenance branches that cannot upgrade to that version for compatibility reasons.
