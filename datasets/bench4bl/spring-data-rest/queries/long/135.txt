I have forked one of the examples of spring data rest to demonstrate/reproduce the issue I'm reporting.
Steps to reproduce

clone repository at https://github.com/swapsapar/Spring-data-rest-sample
run "mvn clean jetty:run" to launch server
browse to http://localhost:8080/PersonWeb/people and notice the paged result
optionally add 20+ people records by POSTing to people via curl "curl http://localhost:8080/PersonWeb/people -X POST -H content-type:application/json -d '
{"name":"bob"}
'"
again notice the paged response  http://localhost:8080/PersonWeb/people with additional links e.g. "people.next"
lets make code changes to reproduce the bug. just run "git cherry-pick 0dad5fc676b4de31cd476d7163f7a7520f41b684"
Now again launch server by "mvn clean jetty:run"
this time we have already added 30 records for People during server startup.
Notice the response at http://localhost:8080/PersonWeb/people
Instead of returning only 20 entries, all the 30+ entries are returned.
Missing links for paging "people.next"
Query as seen in console is missing "limit ?" format.
So something is causing the pagination to not work after upgrade.
I noticed in debugger that CrudRepository.findAll() is called instead of PagingAndSortingRepository.findAll(Pageable pageable)
Cherry-pick change that caused the bug
