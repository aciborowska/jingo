I have a @RestRepositoryResource annotated Spring Data JPA repository that is handling a PATCH to an existing object. While this "transaction" is running, I have additional code that that needs to lookup/find the existing, non-modified record from the database. I am trying to just use the repository instance (the same one fielding the PATH request) to do this lookup. I can't get the real underlying database record, but keep getting back the same object instance in memory that is already mutated by the PATCH.
Now I know this has to do w/ the underlying hibernate Session being managed in that EntityManager in the Spring Data JPA repository but my question is, how can I do this simple thing that I want to do?  I feel like I've spent hours trying to figure this out just so I can code 3 minutes of business logic I need to get done. How can I use this repository to lookup the current state of the record as it exists in the DB (and not get back the already mutated instance)? 
So far the options are not jumping out or seem all that intuitive. Have tried @Transactional on another wrapper method around the repo find method etc, to no avail.
