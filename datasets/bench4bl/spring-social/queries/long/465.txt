Table definition in JdbcUsersConnectionRepository.sql (same as in documentation) does not work for facebook when encryption is used (as recommended by documentation).
I have used `Encryptors.text(...)` and actual length of encrypted token from FB was 480 characters. Therefore I suggest to update the value to eg. 512 for accessToken field.
