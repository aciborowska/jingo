The JdbcConnectionRepository.isConnected() is using MySQL specific (select exists) constructs:






"select exists(select 1 from Connection where accountId = ? and providerId = ?)"






A solution might be:






return 0 < jdbcTemplate.queryForLong("select count(*) from Connection where accountId = ? and providerId = ?", accountId, providerId);
