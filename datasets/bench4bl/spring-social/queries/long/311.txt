When I copy down the Spring Social Showcase the pom.xml is showing errors, meaning it fails to download some of the jar files - specifically the spring social ones.
When I change the properties to reflect the version of the downloads in the "community downloads" the errors clear.
For example changing 
	<properties>
		<org.springframework.social-version>1.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</org.springframework.social-version>
to 	<properties>
		<org.springframework.social-version>1.0.2.RELEASE</org.springframework.social-version>
the mean this jar is found.
But then I am left with errors in the project, like "DisconnectController" not being found. 
Of course this is most likely some problem with my setup, but it is a clean STS install, so should be working.
