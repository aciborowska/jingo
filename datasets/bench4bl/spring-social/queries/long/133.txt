org.springframework.social.oauth2.OAuth2Template instantiates a new RestTemplate instead of injecting one which means it always uses SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory which is not ideal.  This is also inconsistent with org.springframework.social.oauth1.OAuth1Template.  I have included a patch with an additional constructor that allows constructor injection of the RestTemplate and the existing constructor is chained to the new constructor providing backwards compatitibility
