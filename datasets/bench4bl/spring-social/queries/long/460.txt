Spring Social uses the getFilterProcessesUrl() method from AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter to determine the base URL of the request as it tries to determine which provider the request is for. Unfortunately, Spring Security has removed that method, making it incompatible with Spring Social when using SocialAuthenticationFilter.
Spring Security still supports the setFilterProcessesUrl(), however. Therefore, a quick fix might be to intercept calls to setFilterProcessesUrl(), and capture the given URL before calling the parent's method.
