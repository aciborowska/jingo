When you delete a connection, after the deletion process completes the view is redirected to /connect/twitter/twitter /connect/facebook/facebook etc
In my context this happens after I redirect the post request to a popup and execute there.
<form action="<@spring.url "/connect/twitter/" />" method="POST" class="social-signin">
<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="delete" />
<button type="submit" class="btn nxt"><@spring.message 'ui.social.disconnect'/></button>		    
</form>
Regardless of this issue, what is really needed is the ability to determine the post connect action url/view.
