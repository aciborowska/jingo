When trying to automatically create a user, the docs say of ConnectionSignUp#execute:

If execute() returns null, then it indicates that the user could not be implicitly signed up. In that case, ProviderSignInController's explicit sign up flow will be in effect and the browser will be redirected to the sign up form.
However if you are using JdbcUsersConnectionRepository and your ConnectionSignUp implementation returns null, it throws an exception saying "userId cannot be null".
In the forum link above I've proposed a small amendment to JdbcUsersConnectionRepository which brings it back into line with the docs.
