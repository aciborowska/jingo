When errors occur during the connection process, ConnectController and ProviderSignInController currently allow those errors to be exposed as stack traces to the user. These exceptions should be handled more gracefully, perhaps sending the user back to the sign-in or connection status page with a message asking them to try again.
This issue aggregates SOCIALTW-24, SOCIALTW-25, SOCIALFB-47, and SOCIALFB-48, all of which describe different error situations, but with the same core problem: That Spring Social's controllers do a poor job of handling errors.
