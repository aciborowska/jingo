Messages sent to Twitter and Facebook should be sent in UTF-8 so that characters from languages such as Russian will be honored. Spring 3.1's FormHttpMessageConverter has UTF-8 as its default character set, so TwitterTemplate and FacebookTemplate work fine with those characters. In Spring 3.0.x, however, FormHttpMessageConverter's default character set is ISO-8859-1, which results in non-Latin characters being sent incorrectly when Spring Social's templates are used along with Spring 3.0.x.
A test message to try this with is "Если знаете кого-нибудь, который живёт в студенческом городке около метро Парк Победы сообщите." (Which, I believe, translates to "If you know any students that live in the student village by metro Park Pobedi, let me know.")
