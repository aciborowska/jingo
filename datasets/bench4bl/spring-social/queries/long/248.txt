Per section 3.4.2 of RFC5849 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.2), the consumer secret and token secret should be OAuth-encoded when constructing the signature key. Otherwise, authentication will fail if the secrets contain any of the characters covered by section 3.6's encoding scheme.
This has gone unnoticed thus far because none of the OAuth 1 providers we've tested with produce secrets with characters that must be percent-encoded per section 3.6. I discovered this while running some tests against a provider using S2OAuth's default token service (which does produce secrets with those characters). Even though Greenhouse uses S2OAuth, this bug was not discovered there because Greenhouse uses its own token generation which does not produce secrets with those characters.
