Depending on what information is entered by FB user, a work entry may include location, position, and/or description fields. These are neither being declared nor ignored in WorkEntryMixin and thus an exception will be thrown while attempting to deserialize if those fields are present.
Should consider adding those fields to WorkEntry. And to guard against any problems with unexpected fields, should also ignore unknown fields.
