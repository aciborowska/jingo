The servlet path needs to be configurable in the ConnectController's redirectToProviderConnect() method






ConnectController.java






private String redirectToProviderConnect(String providerId) {




	return "redirect:/connect/" + providerId;




}






For example, if my domain is http://mydomain.com and I'm trying to connect to Facebook, redirectToProvider() will redirect to http://mydomain.com/connect/facebook. This will work if you have a RequestMapping that matches such. However if in your web.xml you declared a different URL hierarchy for DispatcherServlet , then you'll run to HTTP status 404.
Assuming you have the following DispatcherServlet declaration:






web.xml






 




<servlet-mapping>




	<servlet-name>spring</servlet-name>




	<url-pattern>/myapp/*</url-pattern>




</servlet-mapping>






When you allow the app to have access to your Facebook account, it will redirect back to http://mydomain.com/connect/facebook which doesn't exist. The right path is http://mydomain.com/myapp/connect/facebook
