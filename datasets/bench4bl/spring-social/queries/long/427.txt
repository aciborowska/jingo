So, I finally figureg out why my site often experiences redirect loops on authentication problems. Spring Social passes as providerId google/ in stead of google. This is because of the hackish way in which the providerId is extracted from the url getProviderIdFromRequest. 
And it's a private method. So, I can't fix this by overriding the method
