Documentation for implicit sign up states that "If execute() returns null, then it indicates that the user could not be implicitly signed up. In that case, ProviderSignInController's explicit sign up flow will be in effect and the browser will be redirected to the sign up form", but this actually does not work.
There should be a check in JdbcUsersConnectionRepository if connectionSignUp.execute(connection) returns null.
