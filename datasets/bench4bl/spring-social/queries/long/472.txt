In the URL : https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-social
Reference to documentation links are returning 404 found error. The links under Spring Social Modules are:
http://docs.spring.io/spring-social-twitter/docs/current/reference/html
http://docs.spring.io/spring-social-facebook/docs/current/reference/html
