PreemptiveBasicAuthClientHttpRequestInterceptor is added in the constructor before the value of useParametersForClientAuthentication can be changed to "true" causing it to be added all of the time.
A simple fix would be to simply provide an overloaded constructor.  This would have the least impact to APIs that have already coded against the current API and don't need to explicitly disable basic auth.
