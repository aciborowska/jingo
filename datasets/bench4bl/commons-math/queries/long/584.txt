The chooseInitialClusters() method declares sum as an int, when it should be double.  It also is quite slow because it contains a lot of unnecessary computation.  I'll attached a patch which corrects the problems.
I found the problems while comparing an optimized implementation of KMeans++ I've been working on with the one in commons math.
