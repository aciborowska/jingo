Since it has access to the full array of stored data, Mean.evaluate(double[]) can improve its accuracy by executing a two-pass algorithm, first computing an initial estimate using the definitional forumla and then correcting that value by the mean deviation against that value.  The attached patch makes the correction and includes an algorithm reference.  It also re-activates and increases sensitivity in some of the certified data tests.  The Michelson data test fails with the current implementation, showing a difference in the 13th significant digit.
This change will improve accuracy in DescriptiveStatistics.getMean and also in Variance.evaluate() and DescriptiveStatistics.getVariance().  There is a cost associated with the change - as it roughly doubles the arithmetic operations required to compute the mean.  Since it only applies to the "stored array" implementation and the implementation will be pluggable in 1.2,  my preference is to move ahead with this change.
