The user should be allowed to chose a tolerance vector dimension different from the state vector dimension.
For example, using the FirstOrderIntegratorWithJacibians, we don't want to set some tolerance error for the jacobian part in order to not interfere with the main state vector integration.
This is really a problem with the dimension of the tolerance vector, there is no work-around assigning some particular value to the tolerance vector.
