It was recently agreed on the mailing list that UTF-8 extended characters should be allowed in the Javadoc comments (in place of &...; HTML special characters), in order to increase readability.
The pom.xml states



  <properties>

    ...

    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>

    <project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding>

    ...

  </properties> 



which, according to this FAQ, should be enough to accept UTF-8 encoding in the Javadoc. However, UTF-8 extended characters are not rendered correctly.
