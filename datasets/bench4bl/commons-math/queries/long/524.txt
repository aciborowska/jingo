I have noticed that clirr report mentions that method 'protected double acceptStep(org.apache.commons.math.ode.sampling.AbstractStepInterpolator, double[], double[], double)' and 'protected void setStateInitialized(boolean)' have been added... However the javadoc for those 2 functions doesn't mention anything about "@since 2.2"... Please check this out!!! Thanks a lot for your attention and your time!
