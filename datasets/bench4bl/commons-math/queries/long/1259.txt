In class Incrementor in the org.apache.commons.math4.util package it is possible to pass a negative number for the max variable. Given that the count variable is initialised to 0 by default, it means that canIncrement() method will always return false. 
I wonder whether it is an acceptable behaviour, given that documentation says that Incrementor is a utility that increments a counter until a maximum is reached. And in the case of negative max this maximum is not reachable at all.
