When secondary equations are used in differential equations, there are several places where the array dimensions are not computed properly, due to a difference between the primary equation dimension and the sum of this primary dimension plus the remaining secondary equations.
A typical case is with multi-step integrators, where the starter integrator is not configured properly even when the routine integrator is configured properly (some information is lost between the two integrators).
