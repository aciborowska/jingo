In class  "DirectSearchOptimizer" (in package "optimization.direct"), the "optimize" method contains this code (at line 270):



if (startConfiguration == null) {

    // no initial configuration has been set up for simplex

    // build a default one from a unit hypercube

    final double[] unit = new double[startPoint.length];

    Arrays.fill(unit, 1.0);

    setStartConfiguration(unit);

}



I think that this has the consequence that it is impossible to call "optimize" a second time, where one would like to solve a problem with a different dimension.
