The ctor MicrosphereInterpolator(int microsphereElements, int brightnessExponent) calls 2 public setters that are not final.
This is unsafe if the class is ever extended.
Likewise for ComplexFormat(String imaginaryCharacter, NumberFormat realFormat,  NumberFormat imaginaryFormat)
Are the setters even needed?
