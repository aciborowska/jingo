I have noticed that the clirr report mentions that method 'public double getSparcity()' has been deprecated whereas method 'public double getSparsity()' has been added... However in the class 'org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector' the javadoc of the first function doesn't mention in which version has been deprecated, while the javadoc of the second function doesn't mention when the second one has been added... I believe that this is a bug... Please have a look at this one... Thanks a lot!
