I have built an agent-based model using the Apache Commons Math library, which has come in handy.
The ValueServer seemed particularly helpful, as explained at:
http://commons.apache.org/math/userguide/random.html
My simulation needs repeatable randomness, so I used this form of the ValueServer constructor:
    ValueServer(RandomData randomData) 
    Construct a ValueServer instance using a RandomData as its source of random data.
    // http://commons.apache.org/math/api-2.2/org/apache/commons/math/random/ValueServer.html
However, in my simulation, I found that the ValueServer did not act deterministically if I supplied the same random number seed.
I have not inspected the source code, but I suspect that the ValueServer is not using the `randomData` generator correctly. If it was, then it should be deterministic.
