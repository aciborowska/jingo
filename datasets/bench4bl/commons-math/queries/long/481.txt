MathUtils.equals(double x, double y) disagrees with Javadoc.
The Javadoc says:
Returns true iff they are equal as defined by  
{@link #equals(double,double,int)}

However, the code actually uses == and checks for NaN:



public static boolean equals(double x, double y) {

    return (Double.isNaN(x) && Double.isNaN(y)) || x == y;

}



The method is deprecated, but it should probably still be consistent with its documentation.
