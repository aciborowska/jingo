Hi,
in RandomDataImpl.getPoisson(double mean) I got the following problem in the case mean>= 6.0:
in the branch if (u <= c1):
if (x < -mu)
    w = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
implicits that (int) (mu+ x) < 0
I found that for some compiler/run-time environments the subsequent update of the "accept" value then fails, as by the right hand side of the comparison leads to an Exception in MathUtils.factorialLog((int) (mu + x)). Some compiler/jre combinations, however, skip evaluating the right side as by isInfinity(w).
To ensure stability, I currently worked around by an explicit if(Double.isInfinity(w)) branch, however, I would like to ask whether there is a more elegant way to ensure general functionality of that method.
Thank you, micha.
