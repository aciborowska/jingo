DifferentiableUnivariateRealFunction declares one method:
UnivariateRealFunction derivative();
PolynomialSplineFunction has this method, but it only implements 
UnivariateRealFunction, not DifferentiableUnivariateRealFunction.
This has not caused any problems for me, but it seems like something that 
should be changed.
