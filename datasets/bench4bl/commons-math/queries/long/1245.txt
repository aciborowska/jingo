The exactP method in KolmogorovSmirnovTest, which is used by default for small samples in 2-sample tests, can give slightly incorrect p-values in some cases.  The reason for this is that p(D > d) is computed by examining all m-n partitions and counting the number of partitions that give D values larger than the observed value.  D values are not rounded, so some values that are mathematically identical to the observed value compare less than or greater than it.  This results in small errors in the reported p-values.
