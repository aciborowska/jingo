When SVD is applied to a strongly rectangular matrix (number of rows way larger than number of columns, typical case of least-squares problem), finite precision arithmetics shows up:

in EigenDecompositionImpl.isSymmetric: a by-definition symmetric matrix returns false;
in EigenDecompositionImpl.findEigenVectors: too many iterations exception
