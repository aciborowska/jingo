The attached patch adds t- and chi-square tests to TestStatistic.  It also fixes
checkstyle and clover test coverage gaps.  Tests are implemented using the
distribution framework to provide exact p-values as well as fixed significance
tests, using double[] data arrays or Univariates to describe sample data.
