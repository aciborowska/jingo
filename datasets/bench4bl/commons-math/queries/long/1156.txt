Despite the fact the pom.xml specifies Java version to be 1.5, some tests for FastMath use reflection to verify that FastMath implements all methods found in StrictMath. As the class available in a Java 8 environment has newer methods, and these methods are not available in FastMath, the test fail and maven refuses to build the artifacts.
The missing methods should be added, just as the new methods were added when Java 6 was relesed.
