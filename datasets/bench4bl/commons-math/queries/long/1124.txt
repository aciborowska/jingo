A couple of observations:
... The default random generator takes a while to instantiate. 
... Many functions of these distributions don't require a random generator. Generally speaking only sampling requires it.
So, why force the default constructor to initialize with a new random generator ... why not use a global generic or simple generator? 
Or do away with random generator except for sampling?
This issue was observed with the TDistribution class , but it is probably applicable to many classes as well.
