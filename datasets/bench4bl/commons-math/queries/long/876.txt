In Commons Math 3.0, all package names start with org.apache.commons.math3, to distinguish them from packages in the previous (2.2) - issue MATH-444.
However, the name of the bundle itself was not similarly changed - in the MANIFEST.MF from 3.0.0, we have this line:
Bundle-SymbolicName: org.apache.commons.math
This should be changed in 3.1 to:
Bundle-SymbolicName: org.apache.commons.math3
As an example, Apache Commons Lang changed their bundle name when they moved from v2 to v3 - exactly what I am proposing for Commons Math.
For various reasons, the existing plugin naming is a problem for us in our environment, where our code uses a mixture of 2.2 and 3.0 classes (there are too many references to quickly change).
