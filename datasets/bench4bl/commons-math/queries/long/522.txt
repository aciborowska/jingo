In the Clirr report is mentioned that the function 'MatrixIndexException(org.apache.commons.math.exception.util.Localizable, java.lang.Object[])' has been added to the class 'org.apache.commons.math.linear.MatrixIndexException'... However the javadoc doesn't comply with this change as it is stated: "@since 2.0"... Please check out this issue so as to be clear... Thanks for your time!
