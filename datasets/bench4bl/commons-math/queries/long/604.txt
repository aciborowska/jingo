The requiresDenseOutput method defined in the StepHandler interface was first created as an optimization feature to avoid calling computeDerivatives too many times for some integrators. In fact, only Dormand-Prince 8 (5,3) needs it because we can save 3 calls per step when the interpolator is not used.
This feature brings more problems than it solves:

it forces users to implement this method despite its purpose is not clear,
even if the method returns false, sometimes dense output will be generated (in fact when there are events detectors),
it creates problems with at least Gragg-Bulirsch-Stoer since this integrator really needs interpolation,
it will create the same problems for Adams integrators (they also need interpolation),
this "optimization" is useful only for one integrator: Dormand-Prince 8 (5,3),
in many cases, even for Dormand-Prince 8 (5,3) it does not optimize anything since people will often need interpolation

So I would like to completely remove this.
Removing the method is backward compatible for users.
