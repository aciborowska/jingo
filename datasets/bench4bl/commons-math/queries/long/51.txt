The EmpiricalDistributionImpl that I submitted yesterday assumed the "old"
Univariate interface, in which getN() returned a double.  The attached patch
inserts the necessary casts to avoid the rounding/truncation errors that were
causing the EmpiricalDistribution and ValueServer unit tests to fail.
The patch also adds a RandomData member variable so that getNext() does not
instantiate a new RandomData instance for each activation
