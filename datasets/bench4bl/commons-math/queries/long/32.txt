I was trying to use this class to round my float values.
class ==> org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils
method ==> round(float,scale)
Input 30.095 output 30.09 - ( i think should be  30.1)
Input 33.095 putput 33.1 - Correct
Input 50.085 output 50.08 - should have been 50.09
Input 50.185 output 50.19 - Correct
Input 50.005 output 50.01 - correct
Input 30.005 out put 30.0 - wrong
30.645 output - 30.65 - correct
So it seems there is some inconsistency. Not sure if its because of the how 
BigDecimal.ROUND_HALF_UP works. but still the data is inconsistent.
