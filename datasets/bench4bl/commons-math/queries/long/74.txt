Just out of curiosity, I ran findbugs 0.9.2-RC3 on the code (see below)
The report shows that there are many uses of == or != for double comparisons.
As far as I can see, most of these can be avoided (e.g. MathUtils.roundUnscaled
has the parameter "double sign" which is effectively only used as boolean)
