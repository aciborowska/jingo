MersenneTwister.setSeed(int seed) has a bug.
If seed is negative, longMT also becomes negative.
First 32 bits are filled by 0xFFFFFFFF.
But it should be positive. First 32 bits should be filled by 0x00000000.
Ex) Integer -1 is 0xffffffff. 
Long -1 is 0xffffffffffffffff.
Long 0xffffffff is 4294967295.
I created simple patch.
