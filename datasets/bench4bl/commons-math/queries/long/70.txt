To do T-tests on data – for which many thanks! – you currently have to do the
following
TTest tester = new TTestImpl();
tester.pairedTTest( ... );
There are two things that are inelegant about this implementation: you have to
explicitly call "new TTestImpl()" instead of using a factory method, and I don't
see why there's this whole interface-implementation paradigm at all. As far as I
can see, there's no state stored in the TTest implementation; why isn't it a
singleton class with static methods instead?
