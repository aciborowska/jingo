With the talk of testing commons-math against additional data sets, I wanted to 
try to make our certified data tests a little more flexible in terms of the 
data they can load and the summary statistics they can verify.
What I've initially come up with is a simple data format similar to the 
existing NIST data set files.  The valid data file consists of blank lines, # 
style comment lines, certified summary statistic lines, and data value lines.
For statistic verification, blank lines and comments are ignored.
A line is deem a certified summary statistic values if it contains an '=' 
character.  Theses lines are parsed into name/value pairs.  The name 
corresponds to a property of DescriptiveStatistics and/or SummaryStatistics and 
the value is the expected value of the summary statistic.
All other lines not identified as one of the previous three types is deemed a 
data value line.  With these lines a double value is extracted from the line 
and added to both a DescriptiveStatistics object and a SummaryStatistics object.
The actual verification process used bean introspection to access the actual 
summary statistic properties from the loaded DescriptiveStatistics and 
SummaryStatistics objects.  These actual values are then compared to the 
expected summary statistic values.
I'll attach a patch which contains all the changes.  I'll hold off on 
committing it until everyone has had a chance to look it over and provide some 
feedback.
