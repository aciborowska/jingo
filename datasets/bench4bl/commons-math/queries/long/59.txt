This is the resubmittal of the chi-squared distribution.  This was removed 
because of the NR references in Gamma.java.  I derived new implementations 
based on formulas found at MathWorld and elsewhere replacing any derivation 
from NR.
If anyone cares, the series representation of incomplete gamma found in NR, is 
derived from the confluent hypergeometric function of the first kind (what the 
he!! is that?).
