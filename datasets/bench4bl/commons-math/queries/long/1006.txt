It would be convenient to be able to embed Tex expressions in javadoc, xdocs and apt.  This can be accomplished via the MathJax javascript display engine.  MathJax can be integrated into javadoc by passing a -header option to the doclet that points to the MathJax javascript sources.  Both maven and ant support this via configuration.  Once pom.xml (maven) and build.xml (ant) are modified to make the MathJax functions available, javadoc can embed Tex expressions by using standard Tex escapes: \( ... \) for inline, \[ ... \] for formulas.
