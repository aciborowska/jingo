In "RandomDataImpl":



private RandomGenerator getRan() {

    if (rand == null) {

        rand = new JDKRandomGenerator();

        rand.setSeed(System.currentTimeMillis());

    }

    return rand;

}



The conditional branch is used by "sample()" in "AbstractContinuousDistribution".
When several "...Distribution" objects are instantiated in a short time interval, they are seeded with the same value.
