On a Windows machine, where there are spaces in the install path, URL.getFile 
returns something like:
  /C:/Jakarta%20Development/commons-math/target/test-
classes/org/apache/commons/math/random/testData.txt
ValueServer then tries to construct a File out of this, which is of course an 
invalid path.  
IMHO it would be better to base the class on InputStream (instead of File), 
since in an app-server the concept of File isn't really defined.  Otherwise, it 
should be based on a URL, and use the openStream method to read the resource.
