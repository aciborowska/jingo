I see two test failures, in both the copies of BOBYQAOptimizerTest:



Failed tests:

(This predated the patches I've worked on so I don't think it's me!)
I tried on Mac OS X and Linux and see the same, so don't think it is an environment issue. I'll see if a little digging can uncover the issue from a recent commit.
