The attached patch includes the following improvements to Univariate and
UnivariateImpl:

Improved efficiency of min, max and product maintenance when windowSize is
  limited by incorporating suggestion posted to commons-dev by Brend Worden 
  (added author credit).  Thanks, Brent!


Added javadoc specifying NaN contracts for all statistics, definitions for
  geometric and arithmetic means.


Made some slight modifications to UnivariateImpl to make it consistent with
  NaN contracts


All interface documentation moved to Univariate. The interface specification
  includes the NaN semantics and a first attempt at clealy defining exactly what
  "rolling" means and how this effects what statistics are defined when.


Added test cases to verify that min, max, product are correctly maintained
  when "rolling" and to verify that NaN contracts are satisfied.
