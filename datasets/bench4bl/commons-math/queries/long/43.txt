Attached patches add getPercentile, getSortedValues to StoredUnivariate
interface and provide implementation in AbstractStoreUnivariate.
Sort uses simple shell sort performed directly on a double[] array copy returned
by getValues. 
Percentile definition used does linear interpolation after computing target
position.
