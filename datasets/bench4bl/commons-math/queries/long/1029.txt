Creating a BigFraction object for large integer values will return different results whether the argument is positive or negative:

  BigFraction f1 = new BigFraction(-1e10, 1000); -> will return a fraction with a numerator of -1e10 and denominator of 1

  BigFraction f2 = new BigFraction(1e10, 1000); -> will throw a FractionConversionException



the problem is in the check for overflow, it is not done on the absolute value of the argument, also it should be done only after the check if the argument is actually an integer.
