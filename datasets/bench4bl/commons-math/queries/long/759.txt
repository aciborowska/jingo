ListUnivariateImpl has two synch. methods:
getWindowSize
setWindowSize
However, windowSize is frequently referenced elsewhere without synch.
It's not clear why the methods need synch., but if there is a need, then windowSize should always be read using synch.
The code should use the super-class getter and setter.
