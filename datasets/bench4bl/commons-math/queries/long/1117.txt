org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.twod.PolygonsSet.getSize() uses a tree internally:
final BSPTree<Euclidean2D> tree = getTree(false);
However, if that tree contains no data, it seems that the reference returned is null, which causes a subsequent NullPointerException.
Probably an exception with a message ("tree has no data") would clarify that this is an API usage error.
