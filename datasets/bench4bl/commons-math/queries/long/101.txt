The attached patch removes the following methods:
1. getMode() from StoreUnivariate, AbstractStoreUnivariate, and StatUtils.  As
defined in the javadoc, the mode has little meaning for continuously scaled data
(which is what will be analyzed in the Univariate implementations).  If users
want frequency distributions, they can use Freq(uency).   
2. Skewness, Kurtosis and Median computations from StatUtils.  We do not need
these internally (they are only supported in the Stored univariates) and they
are much less commonly used than the other methods in StatUtils.  The median is
also redundant with getPercentiles in AbstractStoreUnivariate and it is not
implemented (while the more general getPercentiles is).
