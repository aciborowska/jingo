In a minimization problem, a line search should not return a point where the value is greater than the values at the edges of the interval. The line search violates this obvious requirement by focusing solely on solving for gradient=0 and ignoring the value.
Moreover LineSearchFunction is something that can be used in other contexts, so perhaps this should be a standalone class.
