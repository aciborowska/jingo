The Apache license misspelled acknowledgement.  Made correction to license file 
and to all source file headings.
Made ConvergenceException extend MathException and moved ConvergenceException 
to the org.apache.commons.math packages.
The change of exception heirarchy forced changes in other parts of commons-
math.  All affected, low level routines (gamma, beta, cf, ...) now throw a 
MathException.  All affected, distribution routines now catch a MathException 
and return NaN.
