There are 8 subclasses of BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver which have the public static final field DEFAULT_ABSOLUTE_ACCURACY; this is ths same name as the field in the super-class (and the same value).
This field hiding is confusing, and should be avoided.
In this case, the field hiding is completely unnecessary as well (as far as I can tell).
