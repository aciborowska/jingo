Create a package function to contain classes implementing the UnivariateRealFunction interface for all the usual functions.
As a consequence, all mapXxx methods and mapXxxToSelf methods in RealVector can be respectively replaced with



public void map(UnivariateRealFunction f);



and



public void mapToSelf(UnivariateRealFunction f);
