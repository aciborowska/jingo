The BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver used by the EmbeddedRungeKuttaIntegrator fails, if an event is detected twice with a NoBracketingException.
The problem lies in line EventState.java line 262 (version 3.1.1). Here the event detection function f is applied to an arbitrary choosen value of time. If the event detector crosses zero before this time, the solver throws the mentioned exception.
