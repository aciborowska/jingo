The CMAESOptimizer constructors take array arguments but do not copy the input arrays.  The current implementation does not write to the input arrays, but client code could, making the API contract ambiguous.  This practice should in general be avoided unless the arrays are meant to be in/out parameters or they are expected to be very large.  Neither of these conditions appear to hold in CMAESOptimizer, so the constructors should be modified to copy the input arrays.
