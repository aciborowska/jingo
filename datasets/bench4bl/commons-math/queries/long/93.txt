The javadocs for this function state that
"Throws: FunctionEvaluationException - if v is outside of the domain of of the 
spline function (less than the smallest knot point or greater than or equal to 
the largest knot point)"
I have a series of points, for example ( (12.2,3), (15.4,1.2), (18.9, 4.6)
) that I need to interpolate some data points from. The problem is that I need 
to be able to interpolate from 12.2 through 18.9 inclusive, right now an 
exception is thrown if I try to evaluate for 18.9, which is exactly what the 
javadocs state should happen. Is there a mathematical reason for being able to 
evaluate the first datapoint but not the last one? Can you point me to a 
reference if that is the case? To me it seems to make sense that it should be 
able to determine the value at one of the knot points, ". 
Comments from Brent Worden:
I've looked over some literature and I agree with you that it does not make 
much sense that the function can not be evaluated at one of the knots.
Ben has agreed to spend some time working on a patch.
