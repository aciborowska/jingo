ArrayRealVector(double[] d) allows to construct a zero-length vector, but ArrayRealVector(double[] d, boolean copyArray) doesn't. Both should allow this as zero-length vectors are mathematically well-defined objects and they are useful boundary cases in many algorithms.
This breaks some arithmetic operators (addition) on zero-length real vectors which worked in 2.0 but don't work in 2.1
