I have code simplified to the following:
    KolmogorovSmirnovTest kst = new KolmogorovSmirnovTest();
    NormalDistribution nd = new NormalDistribution(mean,stddev);
    kst.kolmogorovSmirnovTest(nd,dataset)
I find that for my dataset of 10,000 items, the call to kolmogorovSmirnovTest takes 'forever'. It has not returned after nearly 15minutes and in one my my tests has gone over 150MB in  memory usage.
