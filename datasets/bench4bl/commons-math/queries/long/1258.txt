Hi!
There are five classes CanberraDistance, ChebyshevDistance, EarthMoversDistance, EuclideanDistance and ManhattanDistance in org.apache.commons.math4.ml.distance package, which compute different types of distances. Each of them contains method compute(double[] a, double[] b) that accepts two double arrays as variables.
However, if the lengths of array a is greater than the length of array b, the method compute() in all the five classes produces java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
For example,
         private void test0() {
           CanberraDistance distance = new CanberraDistance();
            final double[] a = 
{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 4 }
;
            final double[] b = 
{ -5, -6, 7, 4, 3 }
;
            distance.compute(a, b);
       }
