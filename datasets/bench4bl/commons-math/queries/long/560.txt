During refactoring of the solvers, an @Deprecated javadoc comment was added to the no argument constructor for a number of Solvers, saying they would be removed for 3.0. 
This is incorrect - there is no plan to remove those constructors. See the discussion on the user list on 2011-04-20. The @deprecated tag should be removed.
This causes deprecation warnings in previously compliant code, and should not.
This affects at least the following Solvers: MullerSolver, SecantSolver, NewtonSolver.
