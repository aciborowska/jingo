Found in javadoc comment of method : 
  public double tTest( X, X )
'For a one-sided test, divide the returned value by 2.'
But found in javadoc comment for method :
  public boolean tTest( X, X, double alpha)
'To perform a 1-sided test, use <code>alpha / 2</code>'
where it should be:
'To perform a 1-sided test, use <code>alpha * 2</code>'
confirmed by code of the boolean valued function:
return (tTest(sampleStats1, sampleStats2) < alpha);
