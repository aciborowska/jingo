I am attaching source for a new utility class, org.apache.commons.math.MathUtils
to house useful formulas, extending those that java.lang.Math provides.  Initial
contents are binomial coefficient and factorial methods.  For each of these,
three methods are provided, returning  

value as a long
value as a double
log of the value as a double

Limits on actual parameters for the first two (full value representations) are
specified in the javadoc.
