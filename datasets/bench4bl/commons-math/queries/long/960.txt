Differential equations may be split as a primary equation and several secondary equations. In some cases, the secondary equations may have an effect on he primary derivatives. This can be handled using the method computeDerivatives(double t, double[] primary, double[] primaryDot, double[] secondary, double[] secondaryDot) from the SecondaryEquations interface.
However, when the secondary equations updateds the primaryDot array using this method, the update is ignored.
