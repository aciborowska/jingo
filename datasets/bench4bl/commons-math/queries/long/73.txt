The attached patch fixes style and javadoc errors in RandomData and
RandomDataImpl and gets RandomDataTest as near to 100% coverage as possible
(missed execution paths are traversed only with near zero probability).
The patch also fixes a bug in RandomDataImpl that was, interestingly, discovered
while examining the Clover test coverage report. The reSeedSecure() method was
actually reseeding the non-secure generator.  This error could not have been
caught in any unit test.
