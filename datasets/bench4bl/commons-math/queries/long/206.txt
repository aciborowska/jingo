When running:
public static void main(String[] args) {
        try 
{
            String s = "0.0";
            ComplexFormat cf = new ComplexFormat();
            Complex c = cf.parse(s);
            System.out.println("c = " + c);
        }
 catch (ParseException ex) 
{
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
i get the following error:
java.text.ParseException: Unparseable complex number: "0.0"
        at org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.parse(ComplexFormat.java:307)
        at complexformattest.Main.main(Main.java:26)
With integers it works correctly but support for doubles is even more important ;] (from my point of view). I downloaded the "Latest release"
Hope u fix it quick. I have a proposal but it affects much the code. Maybe You have some quick hint?
