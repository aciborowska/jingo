Ran into problems with DerivativeStructure today. It requires a lot of
memory with 6000 or so independent variables. The problem starts with the number of DSCompiler objects instantiated.
Here is a faster/leaner(less memory) GradStructure that only computes up to the first derivative for the case where there are a large number of independent variables.
