Refer to the following example:
conn.openPipeline();
conn.op1();
conn.multi();
conn.txOp1();
conn.txOp2();
conn.exec();
conn.op2();
List<Object> results = conn.closePipeline();
User would expect results to contain the following:
op1result,exec results(List<txOp1,txOp2>), op2result
Lettuce and SRP are instead returning:
op1result, txOp1result, txOp2result, op2result
Flattening the exec results into the overall closePipeline results is confusing if you are executing multiple txs in pipeline. Also, it loses the case where exec itself returns null due to a watched variable being modified.
