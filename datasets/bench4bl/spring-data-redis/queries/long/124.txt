In RedisMessageListenerContainer.SubscriptionTask class, the run() function gets a new JedisConnection from the underlying Jedis pool (assuming using Jedis) but after the subscription ends it doesn't return the connection back to the pool, causing future subscriptionTask to block on getConnection().
To reproduce the bug:
1. Create a RedisMessageListenerContainer based on a Jedis pool. 
2. Call addListener on the container.
3. Call RemoveListener to remove the subscribed listener.
repeat 2 and 3
Once the pool is exhausted, the future subscription task will block for ever.
