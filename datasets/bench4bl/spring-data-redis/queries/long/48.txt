It would be nice if the following key operations from RedisCommand are also available in the KeyBound interface (operating on the bound key) and in the ValueOperations/HashOperations/ListOperations/SetOperations/ValueOperations/ZSetOperations interfaces (with key as argument, probably introduce a new interface here):
del, exists, expire, expireAt, persist, ttl, type
This would make the code more fluent to write.
