If you do something to cancel RMLC.SubscriptionTask (stop RMLC, remove the last listener, or call removeMessageListener(null, empty list)) immediately after starting the RMLC, it's possible that cancel will execute before connection.getSubscription() returns a non-null value.  This means that cancel will return w/out calling unsubscribe or, more importantly, closing the connection.
This can often be reproduced by removing the sleeps from SubscriptionConnectionTests.
