The AtomicInteger/Long classes expect the Connection.exec() classes to return null if a watched value has been modified.  As of 0.2, SRP does not distinguish b/w actual transaction failures and a null multi-bulk reply returned from exec.  
Need to see if this has been fixed in an upgrade and file issue with SRP if not.
