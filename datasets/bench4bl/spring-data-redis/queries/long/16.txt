DATAKV-40 brought support for database index selection to the connection factories.
Unfortunately, JedisConnectionFactory/JredisConnectionFactory.setDatabase() limit the index range to 0..15, and while this is the default configuration if redis server, one may (we actually do!) configure redis with more databases (or less).
Please remove the upper bound, SELECT will report an error anyways if the database index is not valid.
