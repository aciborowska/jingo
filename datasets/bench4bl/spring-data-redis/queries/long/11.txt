RedisAtomicLong a = new RedisAtomicInteger("a:a", this.jedisConnectionFactory, 0);
jedisConnectionFactory is @Autowired. When performing this: a.getAndIncrement(), I got error saying "redis.clients.jedis.exceptions.JedisDataException: ERR value is not an integer or out of range".
If I perform like this: 
JedisConnection con = this.jedisConnectionFactory.getConnection();
con.incr("a:a".getBytes());
There were no errors. I just checked source but got nothing. I'm confusing now. Maybe it's CASUtils's fault.
And in RedisAtomicLong.class:
public RedisAtomicLong(String redisCounter, RedisOperations<String, Long> operations, long initialValue) {	  
	this.key = redisCounter;
        this.operations = operations.opsForValue();
	this.operations.set(redisCounter, initialValue);
}
I think maybe it's better to add this.generalOps = operations; otherwise this.generalOps is null, if we perform getAndIncrement() just right after using this constructor to instantiate an object, we get a nullException Error.
