In JedisConnection:103-105 the database is selected only if dbIndex > 0.
The problem is, if a connection pool is used and a database > 0 has been selected for a Jedis connection and it is later being requested  from JedisConnectionFactory with dbIndex == 0, then it will not execute select(0) and thus still be connected to the other database.
Select(dbIndex) needs to be executed every time.
