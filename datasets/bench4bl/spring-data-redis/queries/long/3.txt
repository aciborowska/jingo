Invoking RedisTemplate.keys() will cause a ClassCastException:
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.util.ArrayList cannot be cast to java.util.Set
at org.springframework.data.keyvalue.redis.core.RedisTemplate.keys(RedisTemplate.java:548)
This is because that line tries to cast the return value of SerializationUtils.deserialize(rawKeys, keySerializer) to Set<K> but it is in fact an ArrayList which is because "rawKeys" is a Collection so that in SerializationUtils:66 a List instance is explicitly requested.
Fix: the inner class in RedisTemplate.keys() needs to return the Set that is already returned by RedisConnection.keys().
