I'm using Spring 4.1.x and am integrating spring-data-redis 1.7.1. I noticed that it requires a number of Spring 4.2.x components while the documentation doesn't state this requirement. I'm not sure if another version of spring-data-redis is required. In any case, it makes sense to either update the documentation or downgrade the requirement in the pom.xml
