Support for configuring the database was brought to the RedisConnectionFactory implementations in M3. 
I have two minor improvements to be added to the connection factories:
(1) Add a getter for the database index: int getDatabase()
(2) Fix setDatabase() JavaDoc, it still states that the index must be 0..15
