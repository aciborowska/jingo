I came across some strange behaviour. After changing the key serializer at RedisTemplate, ValueOperations still uses the old key serializer. 
This is because of caching ValueOperations (and all other XXXOperations) inside RedisTemplate (see line 77-81 @ RedisTemplate). Due to the fact that all serializers are mapped to internal fields at the ValueOperations constructor changes of serializer at RedisTemplate (not matter which one) afterwards have no effect.
Is that intentional?
