There are 2 problems:
   1.
      If there are null values in a collection returned by RedisConnection, these values are removed from the result when we deserialize them.
      For example if we do:
      hmget key field1 field2 field3 and there's no value for field2.
      RedisConnection will return 
Unknown macro: {a, null, c} 
 but RedisTemplate (after deserialization) will return 
Unknown macro: {a, c} 
.
      It is not correct because we don't know which field is null.
   2.
      If RedisConnection return a null collection (for example when we are in a pipeline or in a transaction), there is a NullPointerException in the deserialize method.
