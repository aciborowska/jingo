BoundKeyOperationsTest.testRename() causes an infinite loop when run with Lettuce.  This is due to the fact that LettuceConnection returns null if no statements were executed in the transaction (as is the case when attempting to rename a key that doesn't yet exist.)  This causes an infinite loop in https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-redis/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/redis/support/collections/CollectionUtils.java#L71
