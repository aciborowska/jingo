There are a lot of threads (800+) created during a run of the full redis test-suite. This is because of improper resource clean-up (connections / connection pools not closed) which keeps a loot of threads around. This led to a JVM crash during test-runs on some systems when building against Java 7 or Java 8 - Java 6 works fine.
We should revise the resource handling in the tests and fix it accordingly.
