The RedisKeyValueAdapter creates an exception during shutdown:






2016-05-03 12:07:02.343  WARN 94337 --- [       Thread-6] o.s.b.f.support.DisposableBeanAdapter    : Invocation of destroy method failed on bean with name 'redisKeyValueAdapter': com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisException: Connection is closed







This is because RedisKeyValueAdapter closes the connection factory before the message listener containers are shut down:






	public void destroy() throws Exception {




 




		if (redisOps instanceof RedisTemplate) {




			RedisConnectionFactory connectionFactory = ((RedisTemplate<?, ?>) redisOps).getConnectionFactory();




			if (connectionFactory instanceof DisposableBean) {




				((DisposableBean) connectionFactory).destroy();




			}




		}




 




		this.expirationListener.destroy();




		this.messageListenerContainer.destroy();




	}







Closing the RedisConnectionFactory seems not necessary as the bean is managed by the container itself.
