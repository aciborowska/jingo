When doing OSGi testing in Spring Integration I've encountered the following






An Import-Package could not be resolved. Caused by missing constraint in bundle <org.springframework.data.redis_0.0.0>




             constraint: <Import-Package: org.apache.commons.beanutils; version="1.8.5">

Should probably be optional
