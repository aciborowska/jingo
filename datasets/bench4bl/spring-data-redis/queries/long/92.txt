In MessageListenerAdapter class, it says "the adapter will simply act as a pass-through." if the delegate object is a MessageListener instance. So I think, if the delegate object is a MessageListener instance, the MessageListenerAdapter will pass the unparsed Message to a MessageListener. Otherwise, parse the Message object and use invokeListenerMethod to dispatch the message to other handlers which don't implement the MessageListener interface.
However, a delegate object has been invoked twice as it's a MessageLisnter instance. Is this a correct scenario or forget to add an else block in onMessage method? thanks.
