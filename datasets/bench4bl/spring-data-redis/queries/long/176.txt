When given timeout in list operations is less than a second, Spring-data rounds it to 0. Zero means "block indefinitely" in redis.
Probably, spring should never round to zero. Correct behaviour would be something like this:
0 ms => 0s 
100 ms => 1 s
1000 ms => 1 s
1010 ms => 1 s
1900 ms => 2 s
In other words, for anything lower than 1 sec, but not 0, round to 1 sec. For everything else - use TimeUnit#toSeconds
