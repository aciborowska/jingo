Currently in ZSet operations, to get the score of the all members, we have to get each member's score individually.
Is there plan to support underlying redis's style zrangeByScoreWithScores() or zrangeByScoreWithScores().
The optional [WITHSCORES] parameter in redis is a good feature to and should be supported.
