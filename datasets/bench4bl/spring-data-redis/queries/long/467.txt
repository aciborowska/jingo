With a 3-node redis cluster, all masters, I've set 100 keys via mset, which seems to have worked correctly. Note: all keys do not slot to the same cluster member. Calling JedisClusterConnection.mGet with all 100 keys returns 3 results. It's hard to tell from debugging but I think the problem is in ClusterCommandExecutor.executeMuliKeyCommand, where a Map of RedisClusterNode to Future<T> is collected and processed. I believe it's discarding the multiple futures per host here by putting them in a Map with the same key, so that the only result we end up with is the last for each cluster member.
