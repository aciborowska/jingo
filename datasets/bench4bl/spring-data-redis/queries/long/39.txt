At the moment, ValueOperations.multiGet() receives and returns a Collection.
I think it makes much more sense to use Lists, because only if one specifies a well-ordered list of keys and receives a well-ordered list of values, does this method make sense.
This is only a small change since the underlying RedisStringCommands.mGet() already uses Array/List.
