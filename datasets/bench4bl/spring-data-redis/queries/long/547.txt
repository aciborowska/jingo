When creating a valid query method in Spring Data Redis without any criteria, for example:






Game findFirstByOrderByStartDesc();







We don't get an error stating that Ordering/Sorting is not supported for Redis, but instead we receive a NPE in the following class:






org.springframework.data.redis.repository.query.RedisQueryCreator#complete
