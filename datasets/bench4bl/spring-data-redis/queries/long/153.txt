The tests using null keys/values in JedisConnectionIntegrationTests cause issues when using a pool, as Jedis does not flush the OutputStream and the Connection is then reused.  We should consider removing the Connection from the pool on NPEs or maybe any error instead of just IOException and JedisConnectionException.
