There are several instances where the code writes to System.err or System.out
This is not generally useful in library code.
A better way needs to be found to report the information, if it is actually needed.
Locations are:
org/apache/commons/crypto/NativeCodeLoader.java
197:            e.printStackTrace(System.err);
229:            System.err.println(e);
org/apache/commons/crypto/utils/Utils.java
76:            System.err.println("Could not load '"
