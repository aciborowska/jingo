According the discussion in commons-dev, we will remove the log dependence of common-logging.
About the logging of native library failure, users of CRYPTO could get the information about whether native is enabled or native failure reason from org.apache.commons.crypto.utils.NativeCodeLoader#isNativeCodeLoaded() or org.apache.commons.crypto.cipher.Openssl#loadingFailureReason(), they could log these information in their system if they need.
At the same time, I think we can add an option for "native only" (Currently, when loading native failed, we log native failure error and use JCE implementation as fallback directly), the property in configuration may like "ENABLE_FALLBACK_ON_NATIVE_FAILED", if user disable the option, it could throw an exception when loading native failed.
