The Utils class reads properties from a properties file if it exists, and adds them to the set of System properties.
There are several problems with this:

there's no way of knowing exactly when the properties will be processed, because it depends when the Utils class is first used
generally it's a bad idea to update System properties.
updates to System properties require additional privileges, so the behaviour of the code will depend on the environment in which it is run.
the code catches Throwable, which is not allowed.

If there is a use case for supporting a properties file, it should be processed at a predictable stage in the code, should be done before command-line parameters are processed, and should not require updating System properties.
