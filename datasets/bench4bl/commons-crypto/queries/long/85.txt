The CryptoCipher.ENCRYPT_MODE and DECRYPT_MODE constants don't seem to serve any purpose.
They should be dropped and the javax.crypto.Cipher constants used instead.
Alternatively, replace them with an enum, which would allow the compiler to check the values.
Note: the values currently have to be checked by both JceCipher and OpensslCipher. Since JceCipher uses the Cipher constant that check would disappear if the CryptoCipher constant were dropped.
