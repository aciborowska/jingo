Makefile.common defines the following:
JAVA  := "$$JAVA_HOME/bin/java"
JAVAC := "$$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac"
JAVAH := "$$JAVA_HOME/bin/javah"
This results in the the following being used at run-time:
"$JAVA_HOME/bin/java"
etc
This is OK for shells that support $NAME as a variable reference; Windows for one does not.
The variables should be resolved at definition time.
