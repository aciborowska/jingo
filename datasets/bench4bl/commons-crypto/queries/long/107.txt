UnsatisfiedLinkError can be returned by System.loadLibrary and System.load.
The code needs to catch this.
It would also be useful to save the exception and provide a means to access it when loading fails.
It's also rather difficult to unit test the code as the class can only be loaded once per run. Moving the bulk of the static block code into a package-protected method would help here.
