Stream has such two Ctor:



// denoted as (a)

public CryptoInputStream(InputStream in, CryptoCipher cipher,

            int bufferSize, Key key, AlgorithmParameterSpec params)



// denoted as (b)

public CryptoInputStream(CipherTransformation transformation,

            Properties props, InputStream in, Key key,

            AlgorithmParameterSpec params)



if use Ctor (b), client user don't have to construct a cipher.  make sense. 
But, in Ctor (a), the cipher argument is create outside Ctor, then it is initialized in CryptoInputStream's Ctor. The cipherâ€™s construction is scattered. It is a bit confusing.
Ctor (a) seem only used internally.  It would be better to hide Ctor (a) for user.
In future, we can consider this:



// don't pass key and iv param, the cipher should be initialized outside

// similar to JDK, and more scalable to support GCM, CCM modes.

CryptoInputStream(InputStream in, CryptoCipher cipher,  int bufferSize)



right now, we just hide Ctor (a) for user.
