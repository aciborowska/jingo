As a general rule, code should never catch Throwable or Error, only Exception.
Sometimes it is necessary to catch more than just Exception, but if so, the code must be careful to rethrow certain errors, e.g.
ThreadDeath
VirtualMachineError
There may be some others
If the throwable is not logged, then it's vital to ensure that only the appropriate ones are swallowed.
But it is better to be explicit and only catch errors which are safe to handle.
