Looks like exception.c/.h are not actually used.
They don't appear to be compiled by the Makefile, and I cannot find any references to the methods in the main native sources.
Also the terror(int) method does not look like it would work on Windows anyway.
Both MacOSX and Windows build and test OK without the files.
