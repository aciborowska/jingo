The CryptoCipherFactory.getInstance method calls getCipherClasses which splits the string containing the class name(s) and then creates an instance of each (if possible) using ReflectionUtils.getClassByName.
However the getInstance method stops processing on the first successful class, so any subsequent entries are not used.
This is wasteful; the call to ReflectionUtils.getClassByName should only be done if it is going to be used.
