The clean target currently consist of:



clean:

	rm -rf $(TARGET)

	rm -rf $(COMMONS_CRYPTO_OUT)



This removes some input files that it needs and anyway COMMONS_CRYPTO_OUT is under TARGET
It should only drop the files it actually creates.
For example:



clean:

	rm -rf $(TARGET)/jni-classes

	rm -rf $(COMMONS_CRYPTO_OUT)
