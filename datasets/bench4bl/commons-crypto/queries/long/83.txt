The method Utils.getRandomDevPath is only used from OsCryptoRandom and should probably be moved there.
Likewise the default value constant
COMMONS_CRYPTO_SECURE_RANDOM_DEVICE_FILE_PATH_DEFAULT
does not really make much sense except to the OsCryptoRandom class.
Note: property key names do need to be centrally defined to avoid duplication.
