The NativeCodeLoader.getVersion() method seems badly named, as it has nothing to do with the native code that has been loaded.
It only relates to the version of the Java code in the jar.
I would expect the method to return the version details from the library itself.
If there is a need to return the Java code version, it should be done from a method in another class, e.g. Utils or Crypto. Note: also the extraction should be done once, e.g. using IODH or using a synchronised/volatile lock.
