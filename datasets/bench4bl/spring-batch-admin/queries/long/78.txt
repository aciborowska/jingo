After an execution of mycom.myJob  I can see the job in the Jobs Tab. If I click on that job I get 'There are no job instances for this job.'  on the Job Instances Page
If I run the  same job  but using '-'  instead of '.' in the jobName ie mycom-myJob  then I can see the job Instances as expected.
