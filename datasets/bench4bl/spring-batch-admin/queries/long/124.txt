When the number of job executions pass 1000, a comma is inserted in the number that is placed on the JSON document (jobs.json). This causes the JSON to be unparseable.
A workaround we used for this issue was overriding the jobs.ftl file in our project and adding quotes around the execution count:
"executionCount" : "$
{job.executionCount}
",
