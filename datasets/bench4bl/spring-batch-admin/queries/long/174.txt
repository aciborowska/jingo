To reproduce:
1. Create more than 20 job executions in the job repository.
2. From spring batch admin web application, select Executions.
3. Click Next page.
An error screen will show up with exception.
The root cause of this issue is in the spring batch, and is reported as BATCH-2087.
Please refer to
https://jira.springsource.org/browse/BATCH-2087
for the reproduce procedure and root cause, and stack trace as well.
As a workaround, we can avoid use table alias prefix for the sortKey in JdbcSearchableJobExecutionDao and JdbcSearchableStepExecutionDao.
