When I use the UI to navigate to an execution I get an info message about not being able to load the execution context.  After tracing through the code I find that SimpleJobServiceFactoryBean creates an JdbcExectutionContextDao but never sets the serializer for that DAO.  As a result, when the UI accesses the execution it fails because it can't deserialize the context.
I have spring batch admin in a tomcat server and when I restart I get this error accessing old jobs.  This seems to prevent the UI from abandoning or stopping these jobs and makes the UI somewhat ineffectual for job control.
