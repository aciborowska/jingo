It seems that the same problem reported on BATCH-1619 appears again.
When attempting to access the executions page of the sample admin batch web app, I revcieve the following exception:
Exception type: class org.springframework.jdbc.BadSqlGrammarException
Exception message: Request processing failed; nested exception is org.springframework.jdbc.BadSqlGrammarException: StatementCallback; bad SQL grammar [SELECT * FROM ( SELECT E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID, E.START_TIME, E.END_TIME, E.STATUS, E.EXIT_CODE, E.EXIT_MESSAGE, E.CREATE_TIME, E.LAST_UPDATED, E.VERSION, I.JOB_INSTANCE_ID, I.JOB_NAME, ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS ROW_NUMBER FROM (SELECT E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID, E.START_TIME, E.END_TIME, E.STATUS, E.EXIT_CODE, E.EXIT_MESSAGE, E.CREATE_TIME, E.LAST_UPDATED, E.VERSION, I.JOB_INSTANCE_ID, I.JOB_NAME FROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION E, BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE I WHERE E.JOB_INSTANCE_ID=I.JOB_INSTANCE_ID ORDER BY JOB_EXECUTION_ID DESC) AS TMP_ORDERED) AS TMP_SUB WHERE TMP_SUB.ROW_NUMBER <= 20]; nested exception is java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Column 'E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID' is either not in any table in the FROM list or appears within a join specification and is outside the scope of the join specification or appears in a HAVING clause and is not in the GROUP BY list. If this is a CREATE or ALTER TABLE statement then 'E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID' is not a column in the target table.
The last causedBy is the following:
Caused by: ERROR 42X04: Column 'E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID' is either not in any table in the FROM list or appears within a join specification and is outside the scope of the join specification or appears in a HAVING clause and is not in the GROUP BY list.
