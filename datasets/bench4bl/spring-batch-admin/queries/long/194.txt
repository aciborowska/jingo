For a job with a step that has a partitioner configured, the individual sub-steps are not displayed.
On the details page of a JobExecution (/jobs/executions/123) only the partitioning step (e.g., uploadData) is displayed and not the individual steps that are executed by the partitioner (e.g., uploadData:a, uploadData:b ...). In the database, the individual steps are persisted correctly, but they are not shown in the spring batch admin interface.
This was not the case in version 1.3.0.M1. This problem has been introduced as part of the change for BATCHADM-177.
