When integrating spring-batch-admin with spring-integration version 2.1.0-RELEASE, we are getting XSD version issue.
org.springframework.beans.factory.parsing.BeanDefinitionParsingException:Configuration problem: You cannot use prior versions of Spring Integration schemas with Spring Integration 2.1. Please upgrade your schema declarations or use versionless aliases (e.g. spring-integration.xsd).
Offending resource: URL [zip:D:/SpringBatchFramework/spring-batch-ear/EarContent/APP-INF/lib/spring-batch-admin-manager-1.2.1.RELEASE.jar!/META-INF/spring/batch/bootstrap/integration/file-context.xml]
As suggested, if we update the config files with version free declaration of XSD files, these issues will be resolved.
