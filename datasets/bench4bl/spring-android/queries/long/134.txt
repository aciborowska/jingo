I noticed that if you specify the targetSDKversion in AndroidManifest.xml file higher than 15, facebook client example does not work. Login process fails. I haven't tested it by with targetSdkVersion below 15 since I need to use latest target in my project. Example works fine with targetSdkVersion=7
Seems some redirection issue with httpclient/RESTemplate in higher version of SDK.
Just in case,I am using
facebook social version = 1.0.3.RELEASE
maven-compiler-version = 3.1
targetSdkVersion in AndroidManifest.xml = 17
On some more debugging it turns out that facebook connection creation fails.
Connection<Facebook> connection = connectionFactory.createConnection(accessGrant);
