Can you update your build xml to modify the component.version property.
It is actually setted to 2.0 and should be to 3.0 dev or 2.1 dev ??
Futhermore, the Manifest file is not automatically generated from build.xml 
properties.
I attach a copy of the build.xml and the Manifest files that I modified to 
automatically update the release number.
I let you to choose which number to use in the build.xml.
Here are diffs that I done from Cygwin because I can't access to the CVS 
Repository from my office 
diff MANIFEST.MF :
