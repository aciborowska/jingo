When I build under JDK 1.5 on MacOSX, I get a bunch of warnings.  Almost all of
them are a result of some APIs moving over to using varargs.  Here is an example
of some of the warnings.  The fixes in just about all cases was to cast a null
to either (Method[]) or (Object[]).  in one place a temporary array new String[]
{ ... } had to be changed to new Object[] { ... }
