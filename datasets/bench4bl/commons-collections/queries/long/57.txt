findbugs 0.6.0 suggested that these classes had inner classes which could be
made static
    CursorableLinkedList.java
    DefaultMapBag.java
    ExtendedProperties.java
    StaticBucketMap.java
The attached patch file patches these classes in that way. After patching the
unit test passed okay.
I'm assuming the unit tests passing is proof enough that these changes are okay.
