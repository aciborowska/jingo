The patch should be:
private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException,
ClassNotFoundException {
	in.defaultReadObject();
	int size = in.readInt();

buffer = new Object[size];
+	buffer = new Object[size + 1];     
	for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) 
{
		buffer[i] = in.readObject();
	}
	head = 0;
	tail = size;
}

Setting tail = size - 1; just caused another bug (ie you couldn't get the last
element in the buffer). This is because tail is supposed to point to the next
unused cell in the buffer array. By creating the buffer to be size + 1, tail
will be set to a valid cell within buffer that is empty (but the cell before it
has an element in it), and the class works properly.
