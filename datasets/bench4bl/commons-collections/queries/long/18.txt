The method ListOrderedSet.decorate(List list) "decorates" the list, implying 
that it leaves the underlying list un-modified.  But this is just not true - it 
requires a modifiable List so it can remove duplicates.  It should at least 
warn about this - so you don't have to look in the code to see how it works and 
see why it fails when using an unmodifiable list (such as given by 
java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList()).
Actually it'd be good to have a variant that worked with unmodifiable lists.
