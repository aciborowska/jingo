LazyCollections.lazyList.get grows wrong when called with i == (size() -1).
If the list has 3 elements and LazyCollections.lazyList.get(2) is called then 
size of the list will grow to size == 4 because within bounds check says:
if(index < (this.listImpl.size()-1) {
Should be:
if(index < this.listImpl.size()) {
