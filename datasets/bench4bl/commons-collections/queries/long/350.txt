MapUtils.getNumber calls "logInfo" on a ParseException and it produces output on the System.out, instead of just returning "null" as the documentation states.
Since the expected behavior is to return null, not print to System.out.  I recommend we remove the call to logInfo and/or remove the System.out.println inside it.
At minimum, if that's not agreed upon, the "side-effect" of writing to System.out should be documented.
I'm happy to offer code for either of these fixes.
