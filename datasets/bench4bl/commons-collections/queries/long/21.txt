TestMap.tearDown() overrides TestCase.tearDown(). The original method throws an
Exception, however the redeclared method doesn't. This means that methods which
override TestMap.tearDown() cannot throw an Exception. In my case, I'm creating
and removing a test database in the setUp() and tearDown() so an Exception could
easily be thrown.
I realise that TestMap isn't part of Collections' public API, however I thought
I'd mention this in case other people want to reuse your excellent testing code.
