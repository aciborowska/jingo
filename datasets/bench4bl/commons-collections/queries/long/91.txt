The CollectionWrapper inner class (part of CollectionUtils) should implement 
Serializable.  This would allow the creation of serializable lists in the event 
that the user needs this functionality.  Making this change would assume that 
all the objects contained in the list were serializable (not a big deal IMO.)
I discovered this problem when using ListUtils.lazyList() method.  The 
resulting list is not serializable and I need it to be.
