When calling ListUtils.predicatedList(List,Predicate), the underlying class used
to create the predicated collection throws an IllegalArgumentException when it
encounters an item that failed evaluation.  This is not the documented behavior
for ListUtils, and it makes that method unusable. 
It probably effects the other predicated collections available in the other
Utils classes.
