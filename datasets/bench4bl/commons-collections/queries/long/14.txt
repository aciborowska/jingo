I just upgraded to version 3.1 and noticed some errors in my application. The 
cause is the method putAll(Map map) I used to call on a MultiHashMap to copy to 
content of one to another. That method is not defined in MultiHashMap any more, 
so HashMap.putAll(Map map) is used. The result of that is a MultiHashMap that 
contains ONE value per key and the value itself is a Collection.
Here is some test code I would expect to work, but it fails:
public class MultiHashMapTest extends TestCase
{
    public void testIt()
    {
        MultiMap original = new MultiHashMap();
        original.put("key", "object1");
        original.put("key", "object2");

        MultiMap copy = new MultiHashMap();
        copy.putAll(original);

        assertEquals(original.values().size(), copy.values().size());
        assertTrue(copy.containsValue("object1"));
        assertTrue(copy.containsValue("object2"));
    }
}
