The attached file patches build.xml to use 'TestAllPackages' instead of
'TestAll' for the value of 'test.entry'. This results in a greater number of
tests being run.
project.xml also uses 'TestAll' but there this patch does not fix that becuase I
am not using maven.
(I find this situation a bit odd because Stephen Colebourne mentioned that some
bugs had been detected in o.a.c.collections.observed package a few days ago by
some tests and as far as I can see those tests would not have run without this
change. Is the use of ant deprecated or am I just not seeing something obvious
or customary?)
