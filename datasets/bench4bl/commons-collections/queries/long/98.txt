The code for BlockingBuffer throws BufferUnderflowException when a
InterruptedException is thrown.  But, the original InterruptedException is not
included or wrapped by the new BufferUnderflowException.  This makes it
difficult to determine if the thread was truly interrupted.
I believe the commons project has support for wrapping exception (to support
older JVMs).  This would be very helpful to support.
For instance, line 141 of the 3.0 version of BlockingBuffer.
Thanks!
