Migrating from collections-generic to collections4 we encountered a type problem with PredicateUtils. When you look at the method anyPredicate(), the signature with array is typed with "Predicate<? super T>" whereas the signature with Collection is typed "? extends Predicate<T>", so the both methods are not equivalent.
We think both methods should have the same types, so it would not break compatibility with a lot of legacy code.
