In general Predicated collections and maps should probably be created before a 
data structure has any contents.  Maybe this is just an artifact of the way I 
use PredicatedList, but, nevertheless, I think all of the PredicatedXXX 
classes need fuller JavaDoc - possibly pointing to an anchor in the 
package.html for the functors package that talks about some scenarios for 
using PredicatedXXX classes.  Right now we don't have a good in JavaDoc 
explanation of the various ways to apply a Predicate to a collection.
(I'm on a Javadoc kick, sorry.)
