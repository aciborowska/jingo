When decorating either CaseInsensitiveMap or IdentityMap (and I believe this will impact any java.util.TreeMap built with a non-.equals() Comparator), ListOrderedMap responds inconsistently with the underlying map.  The ordering seems to be operating off .equals() rather than the actual contents of the underlying map.
