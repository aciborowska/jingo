1.  The remove(Object) methods in the keySet and entrySet correctly remove null 
keys, but incorrectly return false after they do so.
2.  The retainAll(Collection) and removeAll(Collection) methods in the 
collection views do not properly modify the map's modCount, and thus will never 
cause a ConcurrentModificationException.
