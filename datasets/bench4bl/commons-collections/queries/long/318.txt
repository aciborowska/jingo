CollectionUtils.size(Object object) has impossible null check:

    public static int size(Object object) {
        if (object == null) {
            return 0;
        }
...
        } else if (object == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unsupported object type: null");
...


The Javadoc specifically says that null is allowed, so I think the object == null clause needs to be removed - it can never be true, and is just confusing.
