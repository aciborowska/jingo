ArrayIterator & ObjectArrayIterator both have methods to set the array separately from the ctor.
However the method does not allow the same flexibility as the ctor, as it does not allow the start or end indexes to be set.
Is there really a use-case for these setters? If not, all the fields apart from index could be made final, which would make thread safety (and testing) easier.
