I switched from SoftRefHashMap to ReferenceMap and I noticed that the purge
method as become private and is called in many places in the source code, but
the documentation for the method states that it is called only for write operations.
I must be sure that the stale mappings are removed for read operations too
(ex:size) and though currently the implementation calls purge() for all read
methods as well this may change in the future.
I think that calling purge on all [relevant] public methods is the right
approach to preserve a coherent state.
