This method, just calls itself. As BoundedCollection extends Collection, it would seem to me that this method should be removed:
    /**

Factory method to create an unmodifiable bounded collection.
     *
@param coll  the <code>BoundedCollection</code> to decorate, must not be null
@return a new unmodifiable bounded collection
@throws IllegalArgumentException if bag is null
     */
    public static <E> BoundedCollection<E> unmodifiableBoundedCollection(BoundedCollection<E> coll) 
{
        return unmodifiableBoundedCollection(coll);
    }
