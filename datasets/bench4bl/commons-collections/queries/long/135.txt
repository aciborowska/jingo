TransformerUtils says that a null defaultTransformer will return null; this is
consistent with the switchTransformer tests under TestTransformerUtils. 
However, the SwitchTransformer constructor's javadoc says that a null
defaultTransformer means nop, which is incorrect.  Not that it matters, but NOP
would have been more intuitive IMHO, but what's done is done and passing
NOPTransformer.INSTANCE or TransformerUtils.nopTransformer() is no big deal.
