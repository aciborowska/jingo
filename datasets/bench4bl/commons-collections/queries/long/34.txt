Hi,
Just tried building jakarta-commons/collections from CVS (12/5), and it doesn't
compile with Sun's 'javac' for linux:
$ java -version
java version "1.2.2"
Classic VM (build JDK-1.2.2_007, green threads, nojit)
$ ant clean ; ant
....
build-java:
[mkdir] Created dir:
/home/jeff/apache/jakarta/jakarta-commons/collections/dist/classes
[javac] Compiling 26 source files to
/home/jeff/apache/jakarta/jakarta-commons/collections/dist/classes
[javac]
/home/jeff/apache/jakarta/jakarta-commons/collections/src/java/org/apache/commons/collections/FastTreeMap.java:325:
Inner type Entry in class java.util.TreeMap not accessible from class
org.apache.commons.collections.FastTreeMap.
[javac]                 Entry e = (Entry) i.next();
[javac]                 ^
[javac]
....
BUILD FAILED
However, it does work if I set build.compiler=jikes. It also works if I use
jdk1.3 'javac'. Possibly a bug in javac?
Anyway, just thought I'd bring this to people's attention, as the STATUS.html
file states it needs "JDK1.2 or later".
thanks,
