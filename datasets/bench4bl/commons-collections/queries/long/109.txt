Hi,
there is a bug in CollectionUtils. If you pass in a Collection object which is 
not an instance of List to the CollectionUtils.index() methods, the method 
doesn't work: it just returns the given Collection instead of the i-th value in 
the Collection.
I've already reported this (including a patch) to the commons-dev mailinglist, 
but there was no reaction, that's why I'm trying it this way.
Here is the patch (if possible, I will also add an attachment including this 
patch)
regards,
Maarten
