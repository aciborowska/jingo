The constructor AbstractHashedMap(Map map) calls the public non-final method putAll() from the same class.
This is likely to cause problems if the method is ever overridden, as the parent may not have been completely initialised when the sub-class method is invoked. 
Possible solution: extract the code into a common private method. Or make the method final.
