The keySet() and values() views for the 
org.apache.commons.collections.map.ReferenceMap class will throw a 
NoSuchElementException in their toArray(Object[]) methods if any keys or values 
have been reclaimed by the garbage collector and purge() has not been invoked.  
The toArray(Object[]) implementation inherited from 
java.util.AbstractCollection uses size()based iteration rather than hasNext()
based iteration.  This is inappropriate because the size of the map can change 
during iteration.  The problem is exacerbated by the fact that neither the 
KeySet nor Values classes purge stale elements from the list in their size() 
methods.
The attached test case reliably reproduces this exception with Sun's 1.3.1_07 
and 1.4.2 Win2K Hotspot VMs.
The attached diff is a proposed fix for this issue.
