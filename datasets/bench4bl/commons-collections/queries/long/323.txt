The constructor CaseInsensitiveMap(int initialCapacity) throws an IllegalArgumentException if "the initial capacity is less than one". This is inconsistent with the standard Java HashMap constructor HashMap(int initialCapacity), which throws an if IllegalArgumentException if "the initial capacity is negative".
Thus:
new HashMap(0) ==> no exception
new CaseInsensitiveMap(0) ==> IllegalArgumentException.
This inconsistency is confusing.
Actions:

Change Javadoc (this shouldn't be a problem in practice since surely there is no code around depending on the fact that the constructor throws an IllegalArgumentException )
Change code.
