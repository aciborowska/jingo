The values() collection of MultiHashMap isn't backed by the map; changes to the 
map are not reflected in a values() collection, and changes to the values() 
collection are not reflected in the map.  
Though MultiHashMap deliberately violates the Map contract in other ways, there 
seems to be no legimate reason for it to violate the values() contract; since 
values() can be implemented according to contract, it probably should be.
