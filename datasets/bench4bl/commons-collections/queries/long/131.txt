I just "fixed" LRUMap, which was not promoting get(Object) operations correctly.
However, now if you perform a get(Object) within an iteration of the 
keySet(), it will keep promoting values to the top and producing an
infinite loop.  This needs to be fixed, by making the collection throw a
ConcurrentModificationException, or by fixing the behaviour in some other way.
