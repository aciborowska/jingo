All classes in package "org.apache.commons.collections.functors" that advertise that they have singleton instance actually cannot guarantee that.  Because of serialization support multiple instances of those classes can exist at runtime.
Following classes are making this false claim:

CloneTransformer
ExceptionClosure
ExceptionFactory
ExceptionPredicate
ExceptionTransformer
FalsePredicate
NOPClosure
NOPTransformer
NotNullPredicate
NullPredicate
StringValueTransformer
TruePredicate
