Salut. 
Just called javadoc to create the java documentation and wondered about
some warnings, though everything seemed to be at the right place:
Tag @link: can't find removeLRU(LinkEntry) in
org.apache.commons.collections.map.LRUMap
Tag @link: can't find moveToMRU(LinkEntry) in
org.apache.commons.collections.map.LRUMap
"LinkEntry" is a static class in AbstractLinkedMap, LRUMap derives from
AbstractLinkedMap. Why javadoc does not know about "LinkEntry" then, while
java itself does?
The solution comes from the javadoc-API:
"Nested classes must be specified as outer.inner, not simply inner, for all forms."
(http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javadoc.html#@see)
That is the reason, why javadoc spews warnings, when 
{@link
#removeLRU(LinkEntry)}
 is used. 
The correct code will look like this then:

{@link #removeLRU(AbstractLinkedMap.LinkEntry)}

Actually i have found this only in collections.map.LRUMap, its really a minor
thing. But even Eclipse gave me the "wrong" code...
Thanks for the collections, we use them intensily here 
Ciao.
