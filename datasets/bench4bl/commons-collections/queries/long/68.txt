I confirm a bug highlighted by GNU Classpath internal checkings concerning
FastArrayList. It uses two different paths for modifying a list and accessing it
in FastArrayList$ListIter.remove.
On 2005-04-30 SVN snapshot the line which causes problem is at
org.apache.commons.collections.FastArrayList$ListIter.remove
(FastArrayList.java:1308)
because previousIndex() is used on an iterator which has not followed the
modification introduced by a call to List.remove.
This bug is not detected by Sun's JDK.
