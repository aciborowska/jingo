ExtendedProperties.isInitialized() is always false.  The only code that sets it
is in a private init() function that is never called.  Some other apps (Torque)
have depended on isInitialized being set to true after a load but apparently the
Torque devs never realized it wasn't.
I'll attach a patch to correct this.  The patch removes the private, never used,
init() function and sets isInitialized on either a load() or addProperty().
