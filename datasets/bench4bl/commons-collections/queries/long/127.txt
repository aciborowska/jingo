It seems TestReference*Map fail to remove completely the strong references in  
testPurgeValues because some optimization may be done for local variables by a  
JIT compiler. It may be seen with CVS head of the kaffe VM. I suggest to modify  
the testcases using the attached patch. It makes sure that no optimized local  
variables are still on the stack. The bug is present in the head of SVN tree 
(2005-04-30). It is fully reproduceable on kaffe VM (2005-04-30) with JIT3/x86.
