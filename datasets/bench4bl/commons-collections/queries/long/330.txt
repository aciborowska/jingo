Even if the access to a LRUMap is synced and the remove method of the iterator is used that has been returned from the keySet of the LRUMap, it is possible to get a ConcurrentModificationException. This does not happen for remove of the iterators returned by the entrySet or values of the LRUMap. See currently not executed unit test in TestLRUMap (marked as TODO for COLLECTION-3).
