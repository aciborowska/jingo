In the method "AbstractHashMap#doReadObject", the method call "threshold =
calculateThreshold(data.length, loadFactor);" is after the "put(key, value);".
The "put" method uses the threshold to check the capacity of the data array.
In this checking, the threshold is zero, leading to a resize of the data array.
At each serialization/deserialization the size of the data array doubles.
