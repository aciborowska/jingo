It would be a new static method to CollectionUtils class. It would retur 
boolean because add() method from Collection returns a boolean. It would had 
only a line:
public static boolean addNotNull(Collection c, Object o) {
   return (o != null)? c.add(o): false;
}
Of course if c was null, it will throw a NullPointerException. 
Aparently it is possible use a PredicatedCollection with NotNullPredicate. But 
it will trhow a IllegalArgumentException if o was null. It is not interesting.
