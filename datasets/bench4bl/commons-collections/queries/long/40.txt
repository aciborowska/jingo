The default load method for commons.collections.ExtendedProperties currently 
loads properties using the default JVM encoding.  The default load() method 
should use "8859_1" encoding.
Rationale:
1) consistency: java.util.Properties.load() method always uses "8859_1"
2) properties resources are always 8859_1, by convention.
2) On edbcic machines, particularly IBM mainframes, the default encoding is 
Cp1047 (ebcdic), but properties files are always ASCII (ISO8859-1)
3) This bug causes many Apache tools, such as Velocity, which uses 
commons.collections, to fail on non-ascii machines, since they distribute 
properties resources which are (correctly) in 8859-1.
