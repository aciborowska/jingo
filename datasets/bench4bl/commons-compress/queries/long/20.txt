TarEntry defines equals(TarEntry) method which does not override Object.equals() - is this intended?
If so, maybe the method should be called something different such as isSame() to avoid confusion.
BZip2Compressor and ZipArchive return a pointer to a private byte array, thus allowing external code to modfy the contents of the final array.
They should return a copy.
BZip2OutputStream line 1302:   m_block[ m_zptr[ ( lo + hi ) >> 1 ] + d + 1 ] );
Findbugs says:

The code computes the average of two integers using either division or signed right shift, and then uses the result as the index of an array. If the values being averaged are very large, this can overflow (resulting in the computation of a negative average). Assuming that the result is intended to be nonnegative, you can use an unsigned right shift instead. In other words, rather that using (low+high)/2, use (low+high) >>> 1 
TarArchive line 74 may fail to close zInputStream
The classes ZipShort, ZipLong and AsiExtraField implement Cloneable but do not define or use the clone method.
