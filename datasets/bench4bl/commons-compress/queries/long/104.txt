In the maven repository at http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/commons/commons-compress/1.0/ (and mirrors), the SHA1 file for each uploaded file looks like this (shown is commons-compress-1.0.pom.sha1):
commons-compress-1.0.pom: 3259 80A0 9DBB D0C1 08EC  E8E7 733B 462B 00E6 F2A8
This file is in the wrong format for maven and ivy to parse, causing them not to be able to download and use commons-compress.
The file should contain only the sha1 hash, with no spaces, as
325980a09dbbd0c108ece8e7733b462b00e6f2a8
Please fix the sha1 key for all files and re-upload.
