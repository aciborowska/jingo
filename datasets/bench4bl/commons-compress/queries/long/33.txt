There is a bug in the read() method of sandbox' compress TarInputStream, which
will be triggered only when bytes greater than 127 are being read because of a
bad implicit cast from "byte" to "int" (values >= 128 result in negative int
values, because "byte" is signed). I discovered this when applying a
DataInputStream, which makes heavy use of InputStream.read().
Possible Fix:
Change the "return" line from the TarInputStream.read() function from
  return (int)m_oneBuf[ 0 ];
to
  return (int) (m_oneBuf[0] & 0xFF);
Best regards,
