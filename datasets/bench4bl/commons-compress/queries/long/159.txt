ChangeSetPerformer's perform function takes an ArchiveInputStream as an argument and thus frequently runs into issues described under heading 'ZipArchiveInputStream vs ZipFile' at http://commons.apache.org/compress/zip.html 
Personally for a simple local solution I've added a slightly modified performZip function taking a ZipFile argument in place of the ArchiveInputStream argument:
diff perform performZip
1c1
<     public ChangeSetResults perform(ArchiveInputStream in, ArchiveOutputStream out)
—
>     public ChangeSetResults performZip(ZipFile zf, ArchiveOutputStream out)
17,18c17,18
<         ArchiveEntry entry = null;
<         while ((entry = in.getNextEntry()) != null) {
—
>         ArrayList<ZipArchiveEntry> entries = Collections.list(zf.getEntriesInPhysicalOrder());
>         for (ZipArchiveEntry entry : entries) {
46c46
<                 copyStream(in, out, entry);
—
>                 copyStream(zf.getInputStream(entry), out, entry);
A permanent fix may require some re-design, the perform(ArchiveInputStream in, ArchiveOutputStream out) abstraction may be overly general.
