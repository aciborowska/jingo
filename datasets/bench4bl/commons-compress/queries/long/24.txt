The currently used TarIn/Out-Stream implementations in trunk are very old. The newer implementation from the ant project fix many bugs.
For example the getNextEntry() method doesn't skip over datafields correctly. Size isn't set correctly etc.
The old compress tar-code should be updated with newer ant-code. This also blocks features like the proposed ChangeSet.
