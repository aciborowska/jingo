CpioArchiveEntry has the following code:



        default:

            // FIXME: testCpioUnarchive fails if I change the line to

            // actually throw the excpetion

            new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown mode (full mode: " + mode

                    + ", masked mode: " + (mode & S_IFMT));

        }



As the comment says, rejecting invalid modes causes test failures.
These appear to be caused by the code

{bq}
        this.cpioEntry.setMode(0);
in the method CpioArchiveOutputStream.finish()
Is a mode of 0 allowed? If so, then setMode needs to allow it, otherwise the method call needs to change to something else.
