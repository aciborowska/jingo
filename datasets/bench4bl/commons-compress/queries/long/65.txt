The tar header format does not have a "magic" number at the start, so in general it is impossible to tell if an input file is a tar file without reading a lot more data.
The current match() implementation assumes the first 8 bytes contain  "test1.xml", which is obviously a hack for testing purposes.
If more bytes are read from the input, it might be possible to implement a working match() method:
The file must be at least 512 bytes long.
The following offsets have contents that could be checked:
Offset   len
148 	8 	Checksum for header block
156 	1 	Link indicator (file type) - '0'-'6' or null
Other possible checks are:

numeric fields must be octal
filename fields must end in trailing nulls (but can a filename contain a null?)
