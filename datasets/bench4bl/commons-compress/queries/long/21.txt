CompressUtils#compareByteArrays() looks wrong.
The Javadoc says that it compares two byte arrays, however the arrays are treated differently:

public static boolean compareByteArrays(byte[] source, byte[] match) {
        int i = 0;
        while(source.length < i || i < match.length ) {
            if(source[i] != match[i]) {
                return false;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return true;
    }


The code will keep checking bytes from match[] until there is a mismatch with source[].
If source[] is shorther than match[] then ArrayOutOfBoundsException will be generated.
If source[] is longer than match[], then trailing bytes in source[] will be ignored.
Neither behaviour seems particularly useful...
The method does not appear to be used, so perhaps it should just be deleted?
