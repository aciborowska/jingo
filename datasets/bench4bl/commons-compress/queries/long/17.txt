The TarArchive*putStream and Tar*putStream (e.g. TarInputStream/TarOutputStream) javadocs say nothing about which specific TAR format(s) they support.
They merely use the phrase "UNIX tar archive" which is WAY too generic of a statement.
Here are some discussions on the various TAR formats:

I HIGHLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE POSIX.1-2001 SPECIFICATION, SINCE IT SOLVES SO MANY ISSUES (e.g. it supports unlimited path lengths and file sizes).
Corollary, once you decide which TAR formats to support, this needs to be added to the javadocs.  Make sure that the javadocs discuss all limitations for whatever format(s) are supported (especially on pathlengths, file sizes, character sets, etc).  Also make sure and include a hyperlink to a webpage that describes the format standards.
