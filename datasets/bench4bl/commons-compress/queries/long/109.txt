The tar implementation does not currently support Pax extended or global headers; they are treated as normal files.
See http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/pax.html for details.
Pax headers have a different linkType (typeflag) of 'g' or 'x', so can easily be detected.
It would be quite a bit of work to process all the possible headers, so perhaps it would be worth providing an initial implementation that just ignores them?
This should probably be an optional setting.
