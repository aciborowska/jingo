I made a TAR file which contains a file entry where the file is 10 GB in size.
When I attempt to extract the file using TarInputStream, it fails with the following stack trace:
	java.io.IOException: unexpected EOF with 24064 bytes unread
		at org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.tar.TarInputStream.read(TarInputStream.java:348)
		at org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.tar.TarInputStream.copyEntryContents(TarInputStream.java:388)
So, TarInputStream does not seem to support large (> 8 GB?) files.
Here is something else to note: I created that TAR file using TarOutputStream , which did not complain when asked to write a 10 GB file into the TAR file, so I assume that TarOutputStream has no file size limits?  That, or does it silently create corrupted TAR files (which would be the worst situation of all...)?
