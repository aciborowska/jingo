ZipArchiveInputStream.skip uses the condition (skipped != value) to detect when it has skipped enough. 
It would be safer to use (skipped < value) in case skipped somehow exceeds value.
Also, the inherited Javadoc says that skip(value) may skip fewer than value bytes - AFAICT this is precisely the potential error that this method was written to solve.
