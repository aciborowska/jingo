ArchiveStreamFactory.createArchiveInputStream() should throw an Exception if archiverName is not recognised - at present it returns null, which is not particularly helpful.
The method sig says it throws ArchiveException; however it could also throw IllegalArgumentException.
Likewise for createArchiveOutputStream()
