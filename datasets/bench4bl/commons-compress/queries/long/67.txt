ZipArchiveInputStream fails to call setSize() when reading archives created by ZipArchiveOutputStream
I'm not exactly sure where the problem is - looks to be something to do with:



getNextZipEntry(){

...

if (!hasDataDescriptor) {

// calls setSize()

} else {

// does not call setSize()

}



Maybe the DataDescriptor is not being processed, or maybe there is no descriptor and the flag is set wrongly.
