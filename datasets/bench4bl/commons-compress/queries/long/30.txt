Hi There,
Hope all is going well.
The commons sandbox compress bzip2 example compress and uncompress utilities are
currently broken as the CBzip2Input/Output/Stream classes expect the leading 2
bytes of the BZip2 file to be stripped/added outside of the CBZip2xxxStream classes.
This currently means the compress example creates a data file bzip2 can't
understand and the uncompress example throws a null pointer exception.
The attached patch fixes this.
Cheers,
Marcus
