Reflection handles the checked exceptions for Constructor.newInstance() appropriately for:
public ArchiveInputStream createArchiveInputStream( final String archiverName, final InputStream out ) throws ArchiveException 
{...}

However, the other method:

public ArchiveInputStream createArchiveInputStream( final InputStream input ) throws IOException {...}

is not implemented to handle checked constructor exceptions since all Exception catches are not handled. It looks as though this method was not completed. This method should handle exceptions similar to its counterpart.
