The .gz format allows concatenating multiple .gz files as is. A decompressor should decompress the resulting multimember file as if it were a single .gz file.
GzipCompressorInputStream is a wrapper for java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream which doesn't support concatenated .gz files. Only the first .gz member is decompressed and the rest of the compressed data is silently ignored.
