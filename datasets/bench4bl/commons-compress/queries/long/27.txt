BZip2CompressorInputStream.reportCRCError() merely writes an error message to System.err; it should really throw an IOException as indicated in the method signature.
The IOException message should probably show the expected and actual CRCs.
Or at least the method should set a flag that can be tested by the caller.
The code says it does this because "previous versions of the class did" - however this does not apply, as there are no previous versions released.
