When working on the Testcases i figured out that a deletion from an Ar Archive is not as successful as it look at first glance.
For example: my bla.ar file contains test1.xml and test2.xml. I delete test2.xml
The "getNextEntry" Method just delivers test1.xml. Looks correct.
But checking the result file at commandline brings the following:
$> ar -t /tmp/dir26673/bla.ar
test1.xml
test2.xml
vi shows me that there is still the test2.xml entry in the archive,
even when getNextEntry returns null.
Deleting test2.xml and adding test.txt afterward brings the following:
$> ar -t /tmp/dir24825/bla.ar
test.txt
ar: /tmp/dir24825/bla.ar: Inappropriate file type or format
