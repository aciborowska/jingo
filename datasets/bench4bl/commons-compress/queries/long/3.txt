When the method JarArchiveInputStream.getNextEntry() is called after the final archive entry was already returned, an Exception is thrown. This is due to the request to the super class ZipArchiveInputStream.getNextEntry() returning null which denotes the archive is at the end. However that null is used to attempt to try to create a new JarArchiveEntry(null) instance. It is here where the exception is thrown. I suggest doing a quick null check then return null if the archive has been fully traversed.
