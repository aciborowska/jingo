After file upload listener is executed, status code 302 is returned instead of 200. As a result, a redirect occurs and an additional full GET request is triggered. There should be only one partial request with 200 status code returned.
I have pushed a SWF-1482-primefaces project to github and sent a pull request: https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-webflow-issues/pull/3
The list of modified/added files when compared to SWF-0000-primefaces:
web.xml - added PrimeFaces file upload filter;
pom.xml - changed the version of PrimeFaces to 3.2, added commons-fileupload and commons-io dependencies;
JSF and XML files under myflow were modified;
FileUploadBean.java was added.
