When decorating a text input with a dijit.form.TimeTextBox on a page with multiple TimeTextBox decorations, the first field is decorated fine if the 'widgetAttrs' property is omitted from the decoration, but subsequent TimeTextBoxes do not get decorated properly if their decorations are missing a 'widgetAttrs' property.  The subsequent decorations will use the 'name' attribute of the first decorated input as the 'name' attribute for their own elements.  The proof is in the attached test case HTML file.
