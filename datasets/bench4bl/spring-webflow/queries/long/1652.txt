Hi, i've upgraded the version of SWF on my project, to check if this bug(https://jira.spring.io/browse/SWF-1638) was fixed, and i've ended up finding a new bug.
When i try to do a transition of states, the system gives me "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/faces/component/CompositeComponentStackManager".
Seems that this version of SWF is looking for some specific dependencies of Mojarra, and i'm using MyFaces 2.1.15.
