This is arguably an enhancement request rather than a bug, but I feel it is exceedingly rare for any reflection-based method lookup to actually want to locate only methods matching the exact class specified per the behavior of java.lang.Class.getMethod.  The easiest way I see to fix this is to use spring-binding's ClassMethodKey object to create the Method in the cache.
