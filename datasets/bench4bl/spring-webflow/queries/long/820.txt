When the original exception is thrown it is wraped with "ognl.MethodFailedException" and then with "ActionExecutionException". Then "TransitionExecutingFlowExecutionExceptionHandler" tries to get the cause. In case of "ognl.MethodFailedException" should be used "getReason" method.
Also I found another trouble in "TransitionExecutingFlowExecutionExceptionHandler.getTargetStateResolver". If some bad-styled "getCause" exception method will return "this", then we get stack overflow.
