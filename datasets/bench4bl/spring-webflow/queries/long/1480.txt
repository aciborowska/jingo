Partial rendering problem when integrating Web Flow with Richfaces 4.
As described here (http://community.jboss.org/message/610573#610573) , it appears FlowPartialViewContext.getRenderIds() returns an immutable collection , but reference states this collection should be mutable : 
     /**

<p class="changed_added_2_0">Return a
<code>Collection</code> of client identifiers from the current request
with the request parameter name 
{@link #PARTIAL_RENDER_PARAM_NAME}
.
If there is no such request parameter, return an empty <code>Collection</code>.
These client identifiers are used to identify components that
will be processed during the <code>render</code> phase of the
request processing lifecycle.  The returned <code>Collection</code> is
mutable.</p>
     *
@throws IllegalStateException if this method is called after
this instance has been released

     */
    public abstract Collection<String> getRenderIds();
