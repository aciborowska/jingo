Due to one of IE's many lovely quirks in the way it handles select dropdowns, rendering a select as part of an Ajax response into a modal dialog results in the dropdown not maintaining the set selected option for any selection beyond the first entry.
"You can actually reproduce this using the swf-booking-faces application.  Go to the Hotel Search page in IE and change the default page size from 5 to 10.  Do a search and then hit the Change Search Criteria link so the modal dialog comes up.  It doesn't have the changed selection in the drop down - it's set back to 5.  Do it in Firefox, and it works."
