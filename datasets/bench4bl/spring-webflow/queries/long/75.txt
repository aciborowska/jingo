The redirect: prefix isn't currently usable from an end-state (as it attempts to do a conversation redirect - which is not supported from a end-state) [it is resulting in a NPE].
Achieving a context relative redirect from an end-state using the externalRedirect: prefix is possible, but the syntax is not very nice.
The suggestion is to use the redirect: prefix from an end-state to perform a context relative redirect after flow completion.
