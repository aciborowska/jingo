There are cases when a user action may want to handle the http response manually, for example write directly to the response or call methods such as externalContext.requestExternalRedirect(...)
I assume that the user should then call externalContext.recordResponseComplete() to notify the SWF engine that the response was handled.
In these cases the View state should take into account whether recordResponseComplete has been called so that it does not try to handle the response itself. Specifically the resume( ) method should do someting like:
if (!stateExited && context.getExternalContext( ).isResponseAllowed( ) && context.getExternalContext( ).isResponseComplete()) {
 ....
}
What is missing is the last check: context.getExternalContext( ).isResponseComplete( )
Also, I noticed that FlowHandlerAdapter executes the requested redirects without checking if response.isCommited(). Shouldn't this check be present as well, just in case?
