Hi,
flow location registered via addFlowLocation methods without attributes map, such as in:






@Bean




public FlowDefinitionRegistry flowRegistry(final FlowBuilderServices flowBuilderServices) {




    return getFlowDefinitionRegistryBuilder()




        .setFlowBuilderServices(flowBuilderServices)




        .addFlowLocation("/WEB-INF/flows/my-flow.xml")




        .build();




}






creates FlowDefinitionRegistryBuilder.FlowLocation with attributes set to Collections.emptyMap() which is unmodifiable.
When FlowDefinitionRegistryBuilder's updateFlowAttributes tries to add development/true entry into that map UnsupportedOperationException is thrown.
Fix is simple: instead of Collections.emptyMap() create a new concrete map.
As a workaround one can specify a concrete map as an argument to the FlowDefinitionRegistryBuilder.addFlowLocation method.
