The BaseFlowServiceLocator.createConversionService method makes the user supplied conversion service the parent of a generic conversion service containing the standard web flow converters. As a result it's impossible to override these standard web flow converters by setting a conversion service on the BaseFlowServiceLocator with the custom converter registered.
The user supplied conversion service should take precedence over the default.
