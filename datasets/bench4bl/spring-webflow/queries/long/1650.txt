Thanks for fixing the MyFaces detection issue in SWF-1641, but the fix does not work  I had no chance for testing the 2.4.1.RELEASE solution, because the fix and release date where at the same day. 
In the org/springframework/faces/webflow/FlowRenderKit.java line 47 the check was enhanced to 
if (!JsfRuntimeInformation.isMyFacesPresent() && !JsfRuntimeInformation.isMyFacesInUse()) {
But the MyFaces case needs to evaluate to true only, if both requirements are fulfilled. When running with an inactive MyFaces implementation (which was the original issue) the first expression evaluates to false. Because of the && the whole expression is short-circuited and evaluated to false, which causes the MyFaces implementation to load. Correct would have been using
if (!(JsfRuntimeInformation.isMyFacesPresent() && JsfRuntimeInformation.isMyFacesInUse())) {
This will first evaluate if MyFaces is present AND running and afterwards negating the result to jump into the correct block of the if statement.
