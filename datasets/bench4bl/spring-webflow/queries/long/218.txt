Adding a Listener to the flowExecutionFactory have two different behaviours if the SWF is integrated with JSF or not. In the second case (with JSF) the methods are executed only during entering the first state and no further (even though the flowin' of the states executes normally). 
The configuration used to test this behavour adopts a ClientContinuationFlowExecutionRepository, a  FlowExecutionImplFactory, a StaticFlowExecutionListenerLoader and a dummy listener inheriting from the FlowExecutionListenerAdapter.
It's important to remark that this bug have the side effect of making impossible the use of the OpenSessionInFlowListener Patch (with consequent problems of LazyLoading if also Hibernate is used)
