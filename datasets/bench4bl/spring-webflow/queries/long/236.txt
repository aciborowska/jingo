've run into an issue similar to SWF-153
The problem is that while exposing parameters to a render request (in PortletFlowController, line 221 in 1.0) with response.setRenderParameters(redirect.getExecution Input()); a map passed to response.setRenderParameters has kays beeing strings and values also beeing string.
Unfortunatelly, response.setRenderParameters expect a map of keys beeing strings and values beeing ARRAYS of strings.
So, after trying to pass a redirect parameter a portlet container will fail (in case of pluto it is a IllegalArgumentException).
I've created a simple flow with which we can test the issue described:
Code:
<start-state idref="page1"/>
<view-state id="page1" view="/test/page1.jsp" >
		<transition on="next" to="testAend"/>
</view-state>
<view-state id="testAend" view="flowRedirect:testB?paramName=testValue" />
