A number of small (mostly really small) grammar / formatting / code errors in the reference documentation, and the javadoc FormAction class.  Not worth listing them all, so see attached patch.
This includes the documentation correction for SWF-693.
Some of these seem so small that I am afraid they might just be personal preference on my part...my apologies if that is the case.
