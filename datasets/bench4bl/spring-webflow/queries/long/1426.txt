I got this primefaces button configured in pageOne.xhtml:






    <p:commandButton type="submit" value="Next" action="next" />






And my flow configuration is like this:






    <view-state id="pageOne">




	<transition on="next" to="pageTwo" />




    </view-state>




Â 




    <view-state id="pageTwo" />






The view transition works nicely in FireFox, Chrome, and Safari, but it fails in IE8.
