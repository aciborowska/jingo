It could be quite useful to be able to resolve messages in a MessageSource from EL expressions in a JSF view.  Simple support for this could be added through a JSF VariableResolver (or ELResolver for JSF 1.2).  Providing a nice way to handle parameters for the message would require a little more thought, as it would be nice to have a better alternative to JSF's use of the <f:param> tag for this purpose.  Such support may require a custom JSF tag in order to provide maximum benefit and ease-of-use.
