In my project, using SWF with JSF, flow execution state is stored client side, using ClientContinuationFlowExecutionRepository.
When simply a JSF ActionListener is executed, the flowExecutionKey is not serialized correctly, the "_flowExecutionKey" hidden form field has a value of  something like "_c1_korg.springframework.webflow.execution.repository.continuation.SerializedFlowExecutionContinuation@190388". This produces a "java.io.StreamCorruptedException" in the following request.
A workaround would be to call "markNeedsSave()" on the FlowExecutionHolder in the "restoreFlowExecution" method of "FlowPhaseListener":
In the "if(argumentExtractor.isFlowExecutionKeyPresent(context))" section, replace:
	FlowExecutionHolderUtils.setFlowExecutionHolder(new FlowExecutionHolder(flowExecutionKey, flowExecution),
			facesContext);
By:
	FlowExecutionHolder holder = new FlowExecutionHolder(flowExecutionKey, flowExecution);
	FlowExecutionHolderUtils.setFlowExecutionHolder(holder, facesContext);
	holder.markNeedsSave();
This works for me. However, is there an existing solution for this problem?
