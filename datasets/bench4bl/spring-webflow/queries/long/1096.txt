This can be reproduced with both the swf-booking-mvc and swf-booking-faces sample applications. Steps to reproduce:
1. Disable JavaScript
2. Start to book a hotel. Don't enter any data and press Proceed. This will render the same page with the validation errors. (No issue yet, as can be seen when you would use the back button; this will take you back to the previous step. However, don't do this just now)
3. Again, just press Proceed. The screen rerenders as expected with the same validation errors. However, try and press the back button now: you will now get a browser warning that it's about to rePOST our form data. Apparently the last 'Proceed' action did not result in a redirect after POST. 
AFAIK, this is a bug and a redirect should be sent from the server. If this is not the case, I would really like to know the rationale for this behavior and see it documented.
