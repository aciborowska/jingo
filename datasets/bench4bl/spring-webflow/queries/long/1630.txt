Combination of SWF 2.4.0.RC1 with JSF 2.2.4 and MyFaces Trinidad 2.0.1 doesn't function because JsfViewFactory.getViewStateViewRoot() calls static method FlowResponseStateManager.hasState() but FlowResponseStateManager.saveState() isn't called because Trinidad's render kit uses CoreResponseStateManager.
As dirty workaround I have tested an own StateManager (extends FlowStateManager) which stores a dummy Object[2] in view scope with key FACES_VIEW_STATE in its method writeState(). This functions but is really a dirty hack.
