On Page 68 of the Reference manual
There are lots of sentences that are hard to parse but this section was too much.
5.6.2 Configuring the Web Flow system
"The artifacts defined faces-config.xml use Spring to locate the Web Flow system."
looks like an "in the" was omitted
The artifacts defined in the faces-config.xml use Spring to locate the Web Flow system.
Same section next paragraph. I am not sure what it was supposed to say but my guess is as follows.
"In this example inside webflow-config.xml resides the configuration of the Web Flow system the JSF artifacts
will delegate to."
Might be possible to parse it it said,
"In this example, the configuration of the JSF artifacts, to which the Web Flow system will delegate, resides inside webflow-config.xml."
I hope that this is what was intended. 
Here are a few commas ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please distribute them throughout the manual.
Look for sentences and phrases that start with "if", If", "in" and "In". Other places are short of commas but this would be a start.
English is a bitch of a language without proper punctuation. We just string words and phrases together and use punctuation to help guide the reader. Leave out the punctuation and it is anyone's guess as to what goes with what.
Keep up the good work.
