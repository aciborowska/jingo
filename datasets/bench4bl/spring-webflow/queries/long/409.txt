If an action is marked as scope="flow" there is an error when it is accessed by the flow execution.
org.springframework.webflow.engine.builder.FlowArtifactLookupException: Unable to obtain a Action flow artifact with id 'testController': make sure there is a valid [interface org.springframework.webflow.execution.Action] exported with this id; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'testController': Scope 'flow' is not active for the current thread; consider defining a scoped proxy for this bean if you intend to refer to it from a singleton; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalStateException: No flow execution context is bound to this thread
	org.springframework.webflow.engine.builder.xml.LocalFlowServiceLocator.getBean(LocalFlowServiceLocator.java:221)
	org.springframework.webflow.engine.builder.xml.LocalFlowServiceLocator.getAction(LocalFlowServiceLocator.java:124)

P.S. I am using JSF (so no FlowExecutor).
