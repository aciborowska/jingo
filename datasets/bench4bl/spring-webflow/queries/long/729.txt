I'm looking in Spring WebFlow 2.0.1 AbstractMvcView and in
private MappingResults bind(Object model)
when it declares a mapper it never sets the conversion service on it. This causes problems because my custom converter is never used. It looks like formatter registry is the only way to convert when using spring mvc.
