For example, a java.util.HashMap instance that has to be assigned to a java.util.Map argument is incorrectly considered for conversion while the source type is assignable to the target type. To fix this a test has to be added to DefaultConversionService that returns a NoOpConvertor is the target type is assignable from the source type. A patch for spring-binding that implements this fix is attached.
