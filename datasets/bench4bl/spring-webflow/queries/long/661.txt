This is against 2.0.0-RELEASE
With the new model auto binding/validation, as it is right now, it is impossible to handle a String->Number typeMismatch, as the NumberFormatException is never handled, bypassing any binding handling you might have. I have temporarily fixed this by creating a wrapping formatterregistry which catches the NumberFormatException and rethrows as an InvalidFormatException. 
The correct solution would be to actually catch NumberFormatException and rethrowing it as an InvalidFormatException.
