i mentioned this in the forums, but i figure it should be filed as a bug.
http://forum.springframework.org/viewtopic.php?t=5848#23203
to summarize, if an exception is thrown in the flow, the spring Errors object is not bound to BindingActionForm which means that your views will throw an exception if they try to access the form.
this is a problem if you try to handle the exception through the struts exception handlers and then return back to the original form.
since the binding of Errors to BindingActionForm occurs in a FlowListener, some possible solutions might be:
1. change this so the binding occurs in a finally block instead of in a listener
2. add a new type of flow event that gets called regardless of whether an exception is thrown, like requestEnded or something... then having the Errors->BindingActionForm stuff listen for this type of event.
#2 might be generally useful
