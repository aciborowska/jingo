From WebFlow 2.0.8, WebFlow added RichFaces integration. I believe there is an issue when working with RichFaces' Rich datatables.
In the RichFaces distrib, there is a file called extended-data-table.js. You can find it under richfaces-ui/org/richfaces/renderkit/html/scripts
At line 582, you can find this code:
var headerChildChildren = headerChild.childElements();
if (headerChildChildren == null || headerChildChildren.size() == 0)
{

      continue;

}

if (this.enableContextMenu) 
{

      var menuImage = headerChildChildren[7];

      Utils.DOM.Event.removeListeners(menuImage);

      Utils.DOM.Event.observe(menuImage,'click',this.menuImageMouseDown);

}
;
var sepSpan = headerChildChildren[2];
As you can see, Rich-Faces parses the JavaScript DOM in a way that it always expects nodes to appear at the exact same position.
Let us now consider the file Spring-Dojo.js (that is part of Spring JavaScript, included in the WebFlow project). I have attached that file.
At line 300, we currently do this:
response = response.replace(matchAll, '');
In order to work with Rich-Faces, it should be replaced by:
response = response.replace(matchAll, '<script></script>');  
I have attached a patch.
