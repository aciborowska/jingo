In 2.0.5, a Web Flow / Spring MVC View's "action state" (holding the user event and data binding results) is stored in flash scope after event processing to support re-rendering binding error state, even after a redirect [which does not occur in a servlet environment by default but always occurs in a Portlet environment].  Currently, this state is lingering around in flashScope even when the view has no errors and the flow succesfully transitions to the next view.  While this does not cause side effects, it is incorrect behavior none-the-less.  The view action state should only be stored in flash scope when there are binding errors...
