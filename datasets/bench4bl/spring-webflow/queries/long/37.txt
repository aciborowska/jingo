AbstractAction.afterPropertiesSet() does not throw Exception thus making it impossible for subclasses to throw exceptions for bean misconfigurations.
I'm using afterPropertiesSet() in my Action (subclass of FormAction) to make sure that the properties are set properly.  My convention is to throw an exception if there is a required property missing so that the container will complain.  Now, when I try to declare a throws clause in the overriding method, the compiler complains.
