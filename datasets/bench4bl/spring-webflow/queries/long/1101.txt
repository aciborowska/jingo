SWF 2.0.6 added support for maintaining the Jsf view state across redirects, in order to restore the view's correct state after transitions with no target (event handler). (see SWF-964). There seems to be an omission in that fix, since the JSF view state is now maintained even when the view-state is exited and then re-entered. This will happen, for example, after a transition which has the same view-state as target state.
As a workaround, the user may clear the viewRootHolder from the flash scope before the transition.
		<transition on="goToSameView" to="thisView">
			<set name="flashScope.flowViewRootHolder" value="null"></set>
		</transition>
