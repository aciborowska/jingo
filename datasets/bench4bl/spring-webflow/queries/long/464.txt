This means

Adding spring-webflow-1.0-config.xsd and spring-webflow-1.0.xsd to the spring-webflow-2.0.jar
Fully supporting the spring-webflow 1.x syntax in version 2.x, so users 1.x flows can run unchanged on the 2.x engine.
Adding 1.0 config namespace handlers / parsers

1.x flows should then run on 2.x with no change necessary in most cases.  Only 1.x flows that install custom API elements such as view-state or end-state view-selectors will require definite migration effort.
