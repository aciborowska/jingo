When using a single FlowExecutionManager for a web app, createFlowExecution is broken.  The flow is supplied as a parameter, which is then ignored to get the preconfigure instance flow (which is null...)
protected FlowExecution createFlowExecution(Flow flow) {
    return new FlowExecutionImpl(getFlow(), 
        getListeners(), getTransactionSynchronizer());
}
Should use the flow supplied as parameter instead of getFlow().
Hmmm....seems like the latest round of changes in preparation for PR3 introduced a lot of little bugs (this is my 3rd or 4th issue in the past day..all just little mistakes like this)  I still love SWF of course and appreciate all the hard work, but I'd like to see a bit more stability in CVS
