LabeledEnum is unusabled in Java 1.5+ because it extends Comparable without a null generic type. In Java 5 enums automatically implement Comparable of their own type thus causing it to be impossible to implement LabeledEnum. This is really fine with me but I think a Java 1.5+ version of this concept should exist as it seems silly to have to implement my own enum interface and conversion service for this type of functionality.
