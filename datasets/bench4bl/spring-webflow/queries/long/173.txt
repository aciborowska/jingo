I'm not 100% sure what the behavior should be, but it seems to me that a flow registry produced by an AbstractFlowRegistryFactoryBean should only be populated one time, upon initialization.  As it is in 1.0 RC3, every time getObject() is called on the factory bean, doPopulate(getFlowRegistry()) is called.  If there are multiple references to the flow registry within a Spring application context (as there often are), then the registry will get populated multiple times.
I have subclassed AbstractFlowRegistryFactoryBean and only want the doPopulate() method to get called one time.
If a populate-on-initialization is the correct behavior, then to fix it, you just need to change the getObject() to simply return the flow registry and add a call to doPopulate() in the afterPropertiesSet() method.  I'll attach a patch that does this.
