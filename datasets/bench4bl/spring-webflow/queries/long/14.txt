When i execute two chained action states where the second action bean fires an event with id that is missing the message in the thrown NoMatchingTransitionException refers to the first action instead of the second one. Definitely a minor thing but still annoying.
Consider this:
<webflow id="applicationFlow" start-state="action0">
	<action-state id="action0">
		<action bean="applicationAction" method="returnNext"/>
		<transition on="next" to="action1"/>
	</action-state>
	<action-state id="action1">
		<action bean="applicationAction" method="returnNext"/>
		<transition on="success" to="end"/>
	</action-state>
	<end-state id="end" view="end"/>
</webflow>
    public Event returnNext(RequestContext ctx)
    {
        return new Event(this, "next");
    }

executing this flow gives this exception message:
org.springframework.webflow.NoMatchingTransitionException: No transition was matched to the event(s) signaled by the 1 action(s) that executed in this action state 'action0' of flow 'applicationFlow'; transitions must be defined to handle action result outcomes â€“ possible flow configuration error? Note: the eventIds signaled were: 'array<String>['next']', while the supported set of transitional criteria for this action state is 'array<TransitionCriteria>['next']'
The correct message should refer to satate 'action1' and the TransitionCriteria array printed at the end of the message should contain 'success'.
