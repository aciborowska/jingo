Conversion services are not called during binding when using MvcViewFactoryCreator to integrate with Spring MVC. I'm not sure if this is a bug, or it is deliberate behaviour that might need better documentation somewhere.
For example, with the following configuration:
	<webflow:flow-builder-services id="flowBuilderServices"
		view-factory-creator="mvcViewFactoryCreator"
		conversion-service="conversionService" />
	<bean id="conversionService" class="example.example.CustomConversionService"></bean>		
	<bean id="mvcViewFactoryCreator" class="org.springframework.webflow.mvc.builder.MvcViewFactoryCreator">
		<property name="viewResolvers" ref="tilesViewResolver"/>
	</bean>
	<bean id="tilesViewResolver" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.UrlBasedViewResolver">
		<property name="viewClass" value="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.tiles2.TilesView"/>
	</bean>
I would have expected that my conversion service in bean conversionService is used when binding, but it is not. And there actually seem to be two reasons why the conversion service is not used. 
One reason is that AbstractMvcView.bind() creates a new DefaultMapper instance to do the mapping, but does not call setConversionService() on the DefaultMapper instance. This means that DefaultMapper.conversionService will always be null; it does not have access to a conversion service.
However even if DefaultMapper did have a conversion service available to it, I am not convinced that the individual mappings (DefaultMapping objects) would use the conversion service. When DefaultMapping.map() is called, it first checks whether DefaultMapping.typeConverter is null â€“ if null it uses the conversion service, if not null it uses typeConverter. As far as I can tell typeConverter will never be null though, and if so the conversion service will never be used. DefaultMapping.typeConverter is set by AbstractMvcView.addDefaultMapping() for every mapping, and the value it sets it to is a FormatterBackedMappingConversionExecutor instance backed by a DefaultFormatterRegistry instance that seems to created, well, by default.
It could that that the intention is that we use formatters instead of conversion services. If so, that should be documented.
