Facelets is missing in the ivy.xml yet we have Facelets support, should probably be optional
Should the JSF RI be provided?
Any other missing optional dependencies that aren't listed.

This was reported last week but a fix didn't make RC1. It's important to list optional dependencies for documentation purposes and complete ness.
Work with Ben on this to make sure our ivys are correct.
