If an exception occurs in the first state of a webflow which is an action state, then the JsfFlowPhaseListener throws a null pointer exception because it sees null flow execution key. However, if the first state is a view state, and exception occurs during a transition from the first state, there is no error - the phase listener sees a non-null flow execution key.
The exception occurs on the following line:
else {
	// remove the conversation from the repository
	Serializable conversationId = holder.getFlowExecutionKey().getConversationId();
	if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) 
{
		logger.debug("Removing conversation in repository with id '" + conversationId + "'");
	}
	repository.invalidateConversation(conversationId);
}
