If Spring has a problem creating an action bean (bad property being set or whatever), a flow that tries to use that action will log only a FlowArtifactLookupException with the mesage "Chain exhausted looking for flow with id: XXX". This is because the chain lookup class doesn't make a distinction between erorrs when it tries to call the flow artifact locators in the chain. It just swallows and ingnores all errors. It should ignore only bean not found errors...
