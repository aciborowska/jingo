invokeValidatorDefaultValidateMethod calls validate on Validator instances without checking if the validator actually supports the given model. 
The ambiguity in naming the model that led to this being an issue for me can (and probably should) be avoided but since the supports(clazz) method exists, it would be nice if it got used.
