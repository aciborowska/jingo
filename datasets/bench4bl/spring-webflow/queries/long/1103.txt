Using Spring Web Flow/Ajax to refesh a single Tile....  works fine in Firefox, but in IE7 the whole page is refreshed - what happens is:
1) I click on the link.
2) The browser requests the fragment specified.
3) The server responds with just the content of the single associated tile.
4) The browser requests the whole page.
When using Firefox, step 4 does not happen - it replaces <div>s in my document with <div>s with matching ids from the response, which is exactly what I expect. IE7 is failing to replace the divs, and instead requests the entire page (it resends  the same request without the 'fragments' parameter.)
This problem is apparent in the swf-booking-mvc sample application for version 2.0.6. It was OK in version 2.0.5. (NB remember to clear out your IE cache when switching between the two, otherwise the javascript files get cached.)
One way to observe the problem is by using a proxy (such as Fiddler), so you can see what requests are being made.
