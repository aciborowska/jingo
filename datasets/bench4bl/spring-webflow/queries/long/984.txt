Reproducible test case:

Register a custom converter...e.g. StringToBundle
Use it for a list binding... each to support a list of checkboxes binding to a List<Bundle> property on a model.
That will fail, saying it will not know how to converter from String to List.  It should be able to recognize it can apply the custom converter to each list element.
Current workaround is to fallback to default converter for string->type, which limits to per-type specification of conversion logic instead of per-field.
Also, for introspection of generic metadata to work properly you must enable "useSpringBeanBinding" when setting up the mvc view system (MvcViewFactoryCreator) as bean wrapper is the only EL-like system that supports this at present.
