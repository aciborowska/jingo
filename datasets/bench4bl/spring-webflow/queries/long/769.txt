Despite bind="false" on a global "cancel" transition, the flow remains in the same view. When the transition is moved to the view state the cancel takes place.
This is an excerpt from the flow:
	<view-state id="edit" model="account">
		<transition on="next" to="beneficiaries"/>
	</view-state>
	<global-transitions>
		<transition on="cancel" to="endCancel" bind="false"/>
	</global-transitions>
This is used in conjunction with a facelets view.
