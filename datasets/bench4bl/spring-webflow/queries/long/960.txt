The "Smoking" field of the BookingDetails form does not bind the 'on' value correctly when decorated.  With JavaScript turned on, Dojo submits a value "on" when the field is selected.  The backing Boolean converter cannot convert this "on" text value to a Boolean result.  With JavaScript off, the default radio button field submits "true" which binds correctly.
This may be a regression since the upgrade to Dojo 1.2, since the decoration is configured to submit a 'true' value and it appears to be submitting 'on' anyway.
The right fix is most likely enhancing the StringToBoolean converter to be able to convert on/off as well as true/false.  We should also look to upgrade to the latest Dojo 1.2 maintenance release if this is in fact a Dojo bug.
