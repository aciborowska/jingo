After clicking "Find Hotels" in the booking-faces sample, the resulting response (which contains XML) doesn't have a Content-Type header. As a result the redirect works in some situations but not all. In particular it doesn't work in MSIE and it doesn't work if the app is fronted by Apache httpd which adds a stock text/html content-type (apparently browsers won't recognize this as XML).
