Currently transitioning to other states such as action-states to perfrom actions, then transitioning back to the original view-state triggers default redirect+after+post and snapshotting behavior.  In an ajax environment this leads to the server sending a redirect back to the same view, when generally a partial re-rendering of the same view is desired instead.  In non ajax environments, the redirect+after+post behavior s correct, however the additional snapshotting is not needed.
Handling for this case should be revised where:

transitioning back to the originating view-state in the same request does NOT trigger a redirect response for an Ajax request.  Instead, the view should re-render in the same request: either the same view, or one or more fragments.
transitioning back to the originating-view-state in the same request SHOULD result in a redirect+after+post for a non-ajax request.
transitioning back to the originating view-state should NOT result in another flow execution key being assigned and a new snapshot being created. Rather, the current executing snapshot should simply be updated on pause.
