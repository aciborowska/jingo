The sample booking-faces in it's config file webmvc-config.xml uses the following schema
http://www.springframework.org/schema/faces/spring-faces.xsd
This file doesn't exist and it causes validation failures in Eclipse, on the line <faces:resources />
Tried to use 
http://www.springframework.org/schema/faces/spring-faces-2.0.xsd
instead, but then the application doesn't start up properly.
