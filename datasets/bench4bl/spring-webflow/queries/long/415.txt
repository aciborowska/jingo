The 2.0 schema on the website (http://www.springframework.org/schema/.....) contains what appears to be the 1.0 schema contents.  (I haven't done a detailed comparison).  It definitely is different from the schema that's packaged in the 2.0-m2 JAR.  (JAR has "flow-executor", website has "executor").
By the way, what's up with all the "flow" prefixes in the element names?  Isn't that what we have XML namespaces for?
