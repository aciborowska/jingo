FlowFacesUtils always creates its own FlowExecutionImplFactory if it can't find one with a secret name in the ApplicationContext.  It is created with the default constructor so it doesn't get any execution-attributes.  FlowFacesUtils doesn't really look hard enough because there is a FlowExecutorImpl in the context and this has its own FlowExecutionImplFactory with the attributes configured in flow:execution-attributes.  In the non-JSF world I think this is what is used to create a FlowExecution, but in JSF the work is done by the PhaseListener.
A quick fix would be to look a bit harder for the FlowExecutionImplFactory  and use the one that is buried in the FlowExecutorImpl.  It might be better to somehow make the PhaseListener use the same logic / factory as the non-JSF case.
