The method handleReponse of Spring.RemotingHandler creates a span element where temporarly store the content of response. The span is marked with visibility:hidden. Why not use display:none instead?
//line 296 of Spring-Dojo.js  (release 2.0.5)
var tempSpan = dojo.doc.createElement("span");
tempSpan.id="ajaxResponse";
tempSpan.style.visibility= "hidden";
The use of visibility: hidden causes a complete redraw of page with a white flash in firefox 2 and 3 for every Spring.RemotingHandler call (e.g a fragment update) if the page contains a dojox.grid.Grid (perhaps this could happen in another situations?).
