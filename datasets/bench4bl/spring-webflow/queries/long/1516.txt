Using the form taglib "http://www.springframework.org/tags/form" I can display
object validation errors in Spring MVC with
   <form:errors/>
i.e. with no path element.
When used with Webflow, this no longer works.
Using this tag causes getGlobalErrors() to be called.
Spring webflow's implementation of this method in BindingModel looks for a Message with a status of null.
However object validation errors created with Hibernate Validator hava a status of "" and are not matched.
