Hi,
On a reload of the same page, the FlowPhaseListener uses method isDifferent(ViewString viewId, UIViewRoot viewRoot) to check if we are on the same page. 
In case of facelets usage, that method receives a viewId of the form "/mypage.xhtml" (both for the viewId param and in the viewRoot param). Then the method will check "/mypages" against "/mypages.xhtml" and therefore return true. This forces the creation of a new UIViewRoot tree.
Thanks in advance,
