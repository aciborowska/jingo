After a submit with p:commandButton with ajax="false" and validation error, all values in fields are cleared.
Using the same example with mojarra 2.2.6 the behavior is correct! All the values remain after a submit with ajax="false".
I have isolated the test so starting with JSF first, then adding PrimeFaces, then adding Spring, and finally adding SWF, the problem becomes only when SWF is incorporated!!
I try it with h:commandButton instead of p:commandButton and the problem persist!
What I can't understand is why downgrading to Mojarra 2.2.6 the problem dissapears! Can be something broken in SWF when working with Mojarra 2.2.7 and 2.2.8!
The environment used is:JDK 1.7.0_25, Tomcat 7.0.40, Primefaces 4.0, SWF 2.3.3, Spring 3.2.8, JSF 2.2.8
