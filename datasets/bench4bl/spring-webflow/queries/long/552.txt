When the flow is started, null is given as the attribute map, making it impossible for FlowExecutionListeners to change the input map.  Also, this makes it impossible to test flows that have required input mappings.
The null input map also breaks a logging message (NullPointerException).  I'm attaching a patch (one single line) that fixes these.
