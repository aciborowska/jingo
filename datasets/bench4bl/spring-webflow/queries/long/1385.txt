When using the default-servlet-handler element from Spring 3.0.4 and later (and thus mapping the DispatcherServlet to the default servlet), servletRelative redirects on an end state do not work as expected.  
For example, if I have an end state in the "rewards/newReward" flow defined like so:
	<end-state id="rewardConfirmed" view="externalRedirect:servletRelative:/rewards/1" />
This will not redirect to /rewards/1 as expected.  Instead, it redirects to /rewards/newReward/rewards/1.
It's worth  noting that as a workaround, a contextRelative redirect works fine.
