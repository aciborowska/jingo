SWF rc2 is uploaded to the maven repo, which is great. However allmost all dependencies are declared with scope "compile" so all of these dependencies are included when I build a war file.
My suggestion is: replace the dependencies on all of the spring components by 1 on spring-2.0m5 with scope "provided". The clover dep should be scoped "test". 
According to the SWF wiki the only real dependency of SWF are on spring-binding and ognl. These can be kept in scope "compile". The rest can be scoped "provided".
Saves us from excluding a whole bunch of jars in our poms.
