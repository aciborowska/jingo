This is a bug in DefaultFlowUrlHandler; in the case of a servlet mapping like *.htm, the servlet path is populated and the path info is null.  The method that extracts the flow id from the servlet path correctly strips the file extension.  However, the method that generates a new flow url to perform a flow redirect does not append the extension back.  This means the servlet would never be mapped when the redirect is sent.
