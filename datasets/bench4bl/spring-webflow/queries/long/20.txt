The next exception are throwed when match transition was not found:
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 1
        at org.springframework.web.flow.ActionState.doEnter(ActionState.java:372)
        at org.springframework.web.flow.State.enter(State.java:164)
        at org.springframework.web.flow.Transition.execute(Transition.java:248)
The problem is that this exception is throwed due to the log message construction and inside the catch block of NoMatchingTransitionException. Then the NoMatchingTransitionException isn't throwed.
