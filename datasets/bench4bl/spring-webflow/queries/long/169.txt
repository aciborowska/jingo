Hi,
The attributes "then" and "else" of the "if" element in the decision-state are of type IDREF (instead od CDATA).
Indeed, according to the documentation in the dtd, these attributes can be expressions evaluated at runtime against the request context (e.g. then="$
{flowScope.previousViewState}
").
