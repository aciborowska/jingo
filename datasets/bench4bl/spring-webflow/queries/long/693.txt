The example provided for using a Flow Request URL Handler incorrectly shows a flowExecutor being passed in as a constructor-arg:
http://static.springframework.org/spring-webflow/docs/2.0.x/reference/html/ch14s03.html#upgrade-guide-java-url-handler
According the CHANGELOG for 2.0.0, this behaviour was changed as follows:
"  - Removing the FlowController and FlowHandlerAdapter constructors that accepted a FlowExecutor argument in favor of a default constructor with a flowExecutor property.  
    This was done for simplicity reasons for their typical use as Spring beans.
    Please note this change requires a minor update to pre 2.0.0 Web Flow + MVC configurations."
Therefore the documentation should be upgraded to reflect this.
