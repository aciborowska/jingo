Hello,
We are using Spring2.5.3+SWF2.0RC1 under jdk5/weblogic 10.
WE are defing our flows as follow:
<webflow:flow-registry id="flowRegistry" flow-builder-services="flowBuilderServices" >	
		<webflow:flow-location-pattern value="classpath:modules/*/flows/.xml"/>
</webflow:flow-registry>
Our xml file flows are packaged under WEB-INF/classes. Using Tomcat application runs perfectly.
Using weblogic 10, war file is splitted in several jars at deployement time in a working folder.
org.springframework.util.ResourceUtils.getFile(URI, String) then compares computed URI protocol-> zip but expects a file protocol.
This leads to a FileNotFoundException.
Clearly, we think this is a Spring issue more or less related in SPR-994, but coming from a different use case.
Thanks to have a look.
