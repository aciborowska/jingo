ScopeSearchingPropertyAccessor causes a NPE if it's elected to access a property the first time the expression is evaluated and can't recover the property the following times. 
Attached there is a project to reproduce the error:

If we start the application and the first request is /webflow-tests/scopeSearchingProps?test=kk, subsequents requests to /webflow-test/scopeSearchinProps throw a NPE
If we start the application and the first request is /webflow-tests/scopeSearchingProps, subsequents requests to /webflow-test/scopeSearchinProps work fine
