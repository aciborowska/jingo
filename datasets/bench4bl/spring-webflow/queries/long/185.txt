What if a render action, executed on refresh, manipulates e.g. flow scope. That change should remain for the span of flow scope since the semantics of the scope types should be fixed.
Currently FlowExecutorImpl.refresh is not calling executionRepository.putFlowExecution(), which should probably happen to make sure any modifications done to the FlowExecution during the refresh are saved.
Alternatively we should just disallow the change: refresh is supposed to be idempotent, so it should not have any impact on the flow execution at all. So maybe the FlowExecutionImpl.refresh should just setup a read-only RequestControlContext...Makes sense I guess.
