Section 11.4
"The faces:flow-builder-services tag also several other defaults appropriate for a JSF environment. "
I think there is a verb missing in the above sentence. Perhaps it should say something like:
"The faces:flow-builder-services tag also configures several other defaults appropriate for a JSF environment. "
