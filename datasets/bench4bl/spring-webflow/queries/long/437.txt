The first attempt at updating form action URL's with the new flow execution URL as a result of processing an AJAX request is too optimistic.  It assumes that all forms on a page always correspond to the same flow execution instance, but this is incorrect.  For example, when one form is rendered in initial page rendering, and then the ajax request renders a new form into an inline popup control, the two forms should have distinct form action URL's because they represent the flow in two different states.
