There is a bug in the FlowExecutionImplStateRestorer.restoreState() method:
It's using an inner helper class FlowSessionFlowDefinitionLocator to lookup the FlowDefinition objects for all the FlowSessions in the restored flow execution. This process is non-trivial because of the inline flow stuff, 
which are 'containing flow local'.  This restoration will fail if top-level root flow A spawns top-level subflow B which spawns 
inline subflow B-0. I don't see how the FlowDefinition of B-0 will be found by the FlowSessionFlowDefinitionLocator...
