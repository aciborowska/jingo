This pertains to Spring Web Flow in the Sandbox.
org.springframework.web.flow.action.MultiAction
has a setter/getter for the property "delegate" which by default is set to "this"
However, getDelegate() always returns "this".  If someone sets the delegate property, it will be ignored.  getDelegate() should return "delegate".
