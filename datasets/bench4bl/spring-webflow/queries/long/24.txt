The two assertion functions in AbstractFlowExecutionTests seem to have broken recently (version 1.11?).  There is a type mismatch now - the methods assertActiveFlowEquals and assertCurrentStateEquals expect IDs, but the implementations are now asserting against the flow and state objects directly.  ...getFlow() should be ...getFlow().getId() and so on...
