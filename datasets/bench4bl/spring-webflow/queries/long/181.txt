I am having a problem with end states and the way that FlowPhaseListener handles them.  When entering an end state, the end() method in AbstractConversationManager's ConversationProxy is called to attempt to unlock the current FlowExecutionLock.  This fails because there is never any lock acquired on the flow execution, which makes the ReentrantLock code in concurrent throw an Error about illegal lock usage.  Looking at the code, it appears that FlowPhaseListener does not have the exact same functionality that the FlowExecutorImpl for Struts/Spring MVC does (it does not perform any locking/unlocking).  As a result, when my code enters an end state, a stack trace (illegal lock usage) occurs and my application cannot proceed.
I am providing a patch that has addressed this issue.
