In order to remove the burden of needing to manually track and post back the flowExecutionKey from JSF developers, a new approach of storing the flowExecutionKey in the UIViewRoot's attributeMap was implemented.  Since the attributeMap gets repopulated during the RESTORE_VIEW phase of the JSF lifecycle, the restoration of the FlowExecution was moved to after the RESTORE_VIEW phase.  This causes any value bindings that need a reference to the FlowExecution to fail when they are evaluated during the RESTORE_VIEW phase.  Using the binding attribute of a component to bind the component instance to a bean stored within SWF's scopes will cause such a failure.
