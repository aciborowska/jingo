The ConversationContainer.conversations is not Threadsafe, we come across an issue in Jboss eap 6.2 session replication. While one thread is calling getConversation and the other thread is calling removeConversation, ConcurrentModificationException will occur.
Suggest to fix it by 






	public ConversationContainer(int maxConversations, String sessionKey) {




		this.maxConversations = maxConversations;




		this.sessionKey = sessionKey;




		this.conversations =  Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<ContainedConversation>());




	}
