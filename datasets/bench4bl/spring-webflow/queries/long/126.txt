If you try to validate the portlet.xml file in the Spring Web Flow 1.0 RC1 samples (phonebook-portlet) it will not validate.  Here is the error as reported by the XMLBuddy eclipse plugin.
The content of element 'portlet' is not complete. One of '
{"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/portlet/portlet-app_1_0.xsd":supported-locale, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/portlet/portlet-app_1_0.xsd":resource-bundle, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/portlet/portlet-app_1_0.xsd":portlet-info}
' is expected.	
Specifically, at least one portal (uPortal 2.5.2) will fail to render this portlet without this fix.  Adding in a simple <portlet-info> tag with a contained <title> tag fixed the validation problem and allows it to run in uPortal.
It is important to realize this is not a bug in any portal, the portlet.xml schema requires an element that is missing.  Some portals may more lenient then others in accepting portlet.xml code that does not validate.
