The swf-booking-mvc demo bundled with SWF 2.0 M3 has a search form in the page that does not work. There is not a form action declared in the JSP:
<form:form modelAttribute="searchCriteria">
Thus, the form action is rendered by the JSP tag as:
<form id="searchCriteria" method="post" action="/swf-booking-mvc/flow/main/main.jsp">
The action that's rendered is incorrect. If the action is manually changed (through DOM manipulation) to the URL of the displayed page:
http://localhost:8160/swf-booking-mvc/spring/executions/main/{workflow_id)
... then submitting the form works fine. This is reproducible with the SWF 2.0 M3 distro. I didn't try regression testing, but can if desired.
