The web.xml for the jsf-booking sample does not include configuration for spring-js. Also the webflow modules are not included in the war built by ant; notwithstanding the fact that the xhtml files do refer to the sf:xxx tags. 
To fix this, the following should be added to web.xml (and the ivy file updated).
 	<!-- Serves static resource content from .jar files such as spring-faces.jar -->
	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>Resources Servlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>org.springframework.js.resource.ResourceServlet</servlet-class>
		<load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>
	</servlet>
	<!-- Map all /resources requests to the Resource Servlet for handling -->
	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>Resources Servlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/resources/*</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>
Also: note that the following comment inside web.xml
	<!-- Just here so the JSF implementation can initialize, not used at runtime -->
is not applicable for the jsf-booking sample, because the faces servlet is used at runtime.
