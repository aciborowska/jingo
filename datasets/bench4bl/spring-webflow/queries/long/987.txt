This can result in generic converters failing because they don't have the targetClass context to perform a suitable conversion.  This issue was detected when the StringToEnum converter failed when use in conjunction with the BeanWrapperExpressionParser.  The conversion executors adapted as property editors need to be configured with a suitable targetClass context to resolve this issue.
