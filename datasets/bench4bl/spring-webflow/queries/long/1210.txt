We are using JPA and flow managed persistence with spring web flow. On pages that use entities which have properties that are lazily-loaded, with each call of the page one db connection is aquired and not released.
This quickly leads to db-blocking because connections are not released. 
If we change the properties to eager loading everything works fine.
Looking at the code of JpaFlowExecutionListener and HibernateFlowExecutionListener we see that the later one does disconnect the hibernate session on each call of "paused" while the JpaFlowExecutionListener does not do that.
