SWF-1622 is about JSF 2.0 backward compatibility broken. I would like to explicitly point out the the backward compatibility with JSF 2.1 is broken as well.
From source code (Jsf2FlowFacesContext.java) I can see that the class javax.faces.lifecycle.ClientWindow is used there. This class was introduced in JSF 2.2 (http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/faces/lifecycle/ClientWindow.html). So using SWF 2.3.3.RELEASE with JSF 2.1 gives following exception






java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.faces.lifecycle.ClientWindow
