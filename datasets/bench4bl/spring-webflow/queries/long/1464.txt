The reference guide references an old version of the XSD for configuring webflow:
http://static.springsource.org/spring-webflow/docs/2.3.x/reference/html/ch10s02.html
should read:
http://www.springframework.org/schema/webflow-config/spring-webflow-config-2.3.xsd
This may cause confusion for those following the reference and hoping to take advantage of the new validator facility in SWF 2.3.0.
