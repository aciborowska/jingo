It is not possible to bind values from managed beans to JSF UI components for a view that is assigned to an end-state. At least, this known limitation should be documented. However, the sellitem-jsf example shows that it is possible to access the values via the plain $ style jsp binding. According to http://forum.springframework.org/showpost.php?p=112174&postcount=61 it should be possible to create a solution by adding a special case to DelegatingFlowVariableResolver.
