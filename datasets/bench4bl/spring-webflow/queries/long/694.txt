See this thread: http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=54519.  Basically, need additional documentation to describe how to include multiple flow.xml's especially in the case where you are using an abstract parent xml.
Additional, I found this bug on page 82 of the 2.0.1 documentation...it should contain a return as follows:
	private Flow createEditRequestSubflow() {
		Flow mockEditRequestFlow = new Flow("requestEdit");
		mockEditRequestFlow.setInputMapper(new Mapper() {
			public MappingResults map(Object source, Object target) 
{
				// assert that 1L was passed in as input
				assertEquals(1L, ((AttributeMap) source).get("requestId"));
				return null;
			}
		});
		new EndState(mockEditRequestFlow, "requestSaved");
		return mockEditRequestFlow; //<<<<<<<<<<< This is missing
	}
