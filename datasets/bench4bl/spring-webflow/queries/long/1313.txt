In the tag <sf:commandLink/>, the "disabled" attribute is not working. When disabled is set to "true", the link is still enabled.
It seems that the problem also happens with <sf:commandButton />.

This might be easy to fix. This tag corresponds to the class org.springframework.faces.ui.ProgressiveUICommand. 
Inside of it, there is a method called getDisabled(). I believe this is not correct, disabled is a Boolean so the corresponding method should be called isDisabled.
This tag is very close to the one that comes with JSF's reference implementation. This one is called <h:commandLink/>. The tag corresponding to this class is called javax.faces.component.html.HtmlCommandButton. 
Inside this class, the corresponding method is indeed called isDisabled().
