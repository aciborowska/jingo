During the Apply Request Values, Process Validations, Update Model Values, and Invoke
Application phases of the request processing lifecycle, messages can be queued via the FacesContext.
The JSF 1.2 Spec (Section 6.1.5) requires that messages are returned in the order in which they were added.
SWF does not meet this requirement.
After a flow execution the messages contained in MessageContext are stored within flash scope.
The implementation of DefaultMessageContext is not preserving the order of source messages. It uses a simple HashMap when creating the serializable messages in createMessagesMemento().
As a result the restored messages from flash scope are disordered in the following flow execution.
