The actions of existing HTML forms are updated to reflect the correct flow execution URL as part of Ajax response handling, but the algorithm is overly eager in that it simply updates all form elements on the page.  This is undesirable for example if trying to display a new view state in a modal dialog.  If the existing form element is updated to point to the same flow execution snapshot as the new form in the dialog, closing the dialog and attempting to process actions on the original form will fail because the flow execution is restored in an incorrect state.
