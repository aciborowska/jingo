Hi,
we have heavy problems with IE6 and IE8 in a Webflow and Primefaces environment. 
Based on the booking-faces example we set up a project and build up a flow which represents a wizard with 2 views. If we press the "Next"-button on the first page (a p:commandbutton), we move to the second view. But this works only in Firefox, in IE the page does a reload.
The same problem can be seen in the actual booking-faces example: 

build and deploy booking-faces
start with IE
start ...experience
search for hotels => nothing happens
use Firefox: search result is shown...

I will file this bug as primefaces bug too,
