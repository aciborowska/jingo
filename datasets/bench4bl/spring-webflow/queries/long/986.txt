Use case:
a. checkbox binding to List<Capabilities>, selectable from availableCapabilities.
b. registered StringToCapability converter which renders capabilitiy's name as a string
c. even though converter is registered, the value for a checkbox element is the value of Capability.toString(), which is not correct
The bug seems to be in the fact that MVCViews' BindingModel does not implement BindingResult and specifically the findEditor method used by BindStatus.
