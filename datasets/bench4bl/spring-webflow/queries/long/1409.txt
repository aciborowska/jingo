=>Indeed JSF 2 and 1.2 are supported but JSF 2 is not supported in combination with Portlets. We could update the documentation to be more explicit about that.

I will be doing my own testing, but wanted to make sure that Portlet API 2.0 and JSF 2.0 integration is supported to use Spring Webflow.
This section needs to be updated. Would you mind opening a ticket in JIRA for that? 
=>Portlet API 2.0 is now a required dependency. Hence claiming JSR-168 support is arguably confusing. On the other hand changing that to JSR-286 isn't quite the answer either. Again see this issue not only for work that needs to be done in Web Flow but also highlighting the fact JSF Ajax components need to issue Portlet resource requests.
