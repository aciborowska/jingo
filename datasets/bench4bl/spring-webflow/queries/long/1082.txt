SelectionTrackingActionListener tries to inspect current UIComponent if it is child component of a parent UIComponent which uses SelectionAware. When I try to use SWF 2.0.5 together with JBoss's Gravel JSF components there are cases when parent component of UIComponent which signals current ActionEvent is NULL. In such a case we simply get NPE in trackSelection method.
A simple null check like below will suffice to get rid of this little bug:
private void trackSelection(UIComponent component) {
             // Find parent component with a SelectionAware model if it exists
            UIComponent currentComponent = component;
            while (currentComponent.getParent() != null && !(currentComponent.getParent() instanceof UIViewRoot)) {
...
}
