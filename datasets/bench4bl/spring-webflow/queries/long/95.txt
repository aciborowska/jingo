Is there any reason why the current implementation of the JSF Navigation handler for SWF (org.springframework.webflow.executor.jsf.FlowNavigationHandler) actually tries to interpret an action outcome of 'null' as event id (which causes the application to throw up an java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The event id is required: please set this event's id to a non-blank string identifier) instead of falling back to the default JSF behaviour of remaining on the same view for those cases?
I patched this myself and it didn't break anything for weeks now, so I guess its a save way to go.
