This seems to be a known issue but I could not find an Issue here in Jira. 
A note in the booking-faces example in /WEB-INF/flows/main/reviewHotels.xhtml points to it:
<h:dataTable id="hotels" styleClass="summary" value="#
{hotels}
" var="h" rendered="#
{hotels.rowCount > 0}
">
        <h:column>
                <f:facet name="header">
                        <!-- @TODO - Ajax won't work here until JSF RI fixes bug in UIData.invokeOnComponent - scheduled for 1.2_09 -->
                        <sf:commandLink id="sortByNameLink" ajaxEnabled="true" action="sort" value="Name">
                                <f:param name="sortBy" value="name" />
                        </sf:commandLink>
                </f:facet>
                #
{h.name}
        </h:column>
[...]
The above mentioned release is now available. Its changelogs in fact point to some fixes on invokeOnComponent.  
But wehen I tried to replace the jsf-api and jsf-ri jars that came with spring webflow 2.0.3, nothing changes. 
The AJAX call is answered with a single script tag which updates the form action, and that's all..
So what is the status of this?
Is the JSF-RI fix still not working / was it another issue that was fixed?
Are there additional webflow changes needed?
