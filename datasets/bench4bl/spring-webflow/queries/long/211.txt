If you call the FlowExecutionContinuationGroup.add method multiple times with the same continuationId, the internal continuations and continuationIds data structures will get out of sync.
This situation will occur with flow refreshes since the FlowExecutorImpl does not generate a new key for a refresh, so it will effectively call the add method with a key that is already in the continuation group.
