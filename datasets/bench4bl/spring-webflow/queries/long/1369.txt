Hello there,
We have an environment with WebFlow 2.0.9, Security 3.0.1, and Spring core 3.0.0 versions.  I had to come up with a workaround to configure the SecurityFlowExecutionListener.
It seems Security 3 has refactored into different packages and is not reverse compatible with code written against Security 2 like the WebFlow 2.0.9 SecurityFlowExecutionListener.  I pulled the code (from spring-webflow-2.0.9.CI-380) and recompiled into a different class called SecurityThreeFlowExecutionListener (attached) in my own project.  I then configured this in the context and everything works great:
	<webflow:flow-executor id="flowExecutor">
		<webflow:flow-execution-listeners>
			<webflow:listener ref="securityFlowExecutionListener" />
		</webflow:flow-execution-listeners>
	</webflow:flow-executor>
	<!-- Installs a listener to apply Spring Security authorities -->
	<!-- This uses a temporary bridge between Flow 2 and Security 3 -->
	<!-- <bean id="securityFlowExecutionListener" class="org.springframework.webflow.security.SecurityFlowExecutionListener" /> -->
	<bean id="securityFlowExecutionListener" class="com.mattscompany.security.SecurityThreeFlowExecutionListener" /> 
The main change was to import from the new Security 3 packages, but I also commented out a ConfigAttributeDefinition reference from the decide method that I could not find in Security 3 which has not impacted me.
I looked through to see if this was already addressed in Flow 3 but did not find anything.
Thanks,
Matt
