An almost identical issue was recently fixed by Juergen for Spring core 2.0.1 / 1.2.9: SPR-2258
Usage of InheritableThreadLocal in ExternalContextHolder is the same thing. Instead of duplicating the reasons why you should (almost) never use InheritableThreadLocal in a J2EE environment, I'll just point you to SPR-2258.
I'm not asking to unconditionally remove this, just make it configurable with a safe default.
