In webflow reference it states that we can use <input name="mode" value="'embedded'"/> in a subflow definition to prevent the POST-REDIRECT-GET (e.g. in a popup). However this attribute is never verified by the implementation on subflows.
The only way to start a flow in embedded mode is to provide the ?mode=embedded request parameter at flow start. In this case, the whole flow will be in "embedded" mode, instead of only the required subflow.
