I have a global transition for an exception and an action that throws an exception from on-entry of the first view state. A transition is actually attempted but results in a null pointer exception in AbstractFlowExecutionRepository.getConversation where the execution key is null. If on-entry is changed to on-render the problem does not occur.
I will attach a sample flow definition and server output.
