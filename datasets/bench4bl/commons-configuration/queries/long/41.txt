I am using Commons Configuration 1.1.
Saving 'FielConfiguration's the configuration files will be overwritten every time.
Bad if you have formatted them with descriptions and comments ... but this is
not so important.
Not so good is, that in the class:
PropertiesConfiguration:
'\n' is used as "line separator" and not the "System.getProperty("line.separator")".
So, on Windows systems the configuration files are badly readable.
XMLConfiguration:
The encoding is not looped though to the encoding in the XML head declaration.
Every time "UTF-8" is set (<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>)
I would prefer that my encoding (setEncoding()) is reflected in the XML document.
Is there a reason that it is implemented like you do?
Attached are patches which would resolve the problems (if you want):
