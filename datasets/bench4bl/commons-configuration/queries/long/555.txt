if I give this in the configuration:
<test xml:space="preserve"> a b c </test>
It does not seem to preserve the whitespace on the current node.  However, if I do
<space xml:space="preserve>
   <test> a b c </test>
</space>
it does preserve it. I would like to be able to turn on whitespace preservation on the current node without changing the path to my node.
I tested my values by printing out values retrieved from getList() method.
