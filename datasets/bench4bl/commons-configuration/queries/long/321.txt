The getKeys(String prefix) implementation of AbstractHierarchicalConfiguration doesn't return anything if the prefix used is the key of an existing property. The iterator returned should at least contain the key used as the prefix.
Here is the test method for TestHierarchicalConfiguration, currently the first assertion fails:

public void testGetKeysWithKeyAsPrefix()
{
    Iterator<?> it = config.getKeys("order.key1");
    assertTrue("no key found", it.hasNext());
    assertEquals("1st key", "order.key1", it.next());
    assertFalse("more keys than expected", it.hasNext());
}
