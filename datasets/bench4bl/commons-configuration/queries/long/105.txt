We use XMLConfiguration to store our application user preferences.
the preferences are persisted in a FileManager, which delivers the files using
the HTTP protocol.
As each user has its own preferences, the URL we use to get the preferences is :
http://server/ContentAcces?id=<the_id>&session=<session_id>
As the code of setUrl in AbstractFileConfiguration is : 
 public void setURL(URL url)
    {
        setBasePath(ConfigurationUtils.getBasePath(url));
        setFileName(ConfigurationUtils.getFileName(url));
    }

the request parameters of the URL are not stored in the URL, and when getUrl is
called, null is returned, because the composed URL (http://server/ContentAcces)
cannot be opened.
