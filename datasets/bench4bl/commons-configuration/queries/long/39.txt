The current javadoc for 1.1 version of Configuration is as follows:

A reloading strategy that will reload the configuration every time its underlying file is changed. The file 
is not reloaded more than once every 5 seconds by default, this time can be changed by setting the 
refresh delay. This strategy only works with FileConfiguration instances.

I was under the false impression that a thread would be created which would periodically wake up every 
5 seconds and poll the property file to see if it has changed or not. If the file has changed then it would 
be reloaded. However this is not the case. After diving into the code, you need to call one of the get*() 
methods (i.e. getInt(), getLong(), etc...) before the file is checked.
Finally, it would be nice to have some kind of callback mechanism to notify listeners that implement a 
well known interface defined in the configuration API that the file has changed.
Thanks for all your hard work!
