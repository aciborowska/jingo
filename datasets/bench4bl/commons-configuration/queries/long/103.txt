Invoking subset() on an XMLConfiguration causes the underlying hierarchy to 
change.  For example, using the database example on the webpage, performing 
the following and then serializing the XMLConfiguration file will show the 
structure has been altered:
XMLConfiguration xmlConfig = new XMLConfiguration(databaseDotXmlUrl);
xmlConfig.subset("tables.table(0");
xmlConfig.save("C:/AlteredDatabase.xml");
Not sure this was the intent of the method... actually the method returns a 
new HierarchicalConfiguration object but this method has undesired side effect 
on the original configuration.
