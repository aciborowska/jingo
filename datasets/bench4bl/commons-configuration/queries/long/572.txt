We altered our code to use CombinedConfiguration in a more dynamic way and immediately started to see large memory usage. Looking for a potential leak, we realised we were missing a clear() when the config objects were done with.
Even with this call in, the leak persisted. It seems that whilst the clear() method cleans up the object, it doesn't clear the listener list as well. This leaves around stale references which then never become GC.
Will attach the patch we found worked at curing this
