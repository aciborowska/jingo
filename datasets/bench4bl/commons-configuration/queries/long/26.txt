in AbstractConfiguration.resolveContainerStore (javadoc):

Returns an object from the store described by the key. If the value is a
List object, replace it with the first object in the list.

but what if getProperty returns a List because this is the type of the property? 
 this code will silently grab the first elemen. I don't understand why. Probably 
the reason is that some class extending AbstractConfiguration returns List for 
properties. In this case I think the better approach is to have that class 
return the first element instead, rather than returning the List and letting 
AbstractConfiguration (which is used by many other implementations, including 
outside of the configuration package) handle it
