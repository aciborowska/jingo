The webpage at
https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/dependency-info.html
documents the following maven dependency snippet for version 2.0-beta1, but it does not work since this version has not actually been published to the maven repos:
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons-configuration2</artifactId>
  <version>2.0-beta1</version>
</dependency>
Please consider either correctly publish the jars as documented, or remove this documentation from the website, as it is misleading to users.
