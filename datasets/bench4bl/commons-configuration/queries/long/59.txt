This appeared to be fixed in 1.0 (COM-1431) but reappears in 1.1
With the new XMLConfiguration, which is hierarchical, properties with a dot in
their name apparently can be loaded, but the get methods don't find them.
For example:
<config>
    <test>
        <myservice-1.0>URL to my service 1.0</myservice-1.0>
        <myservice-1.1>URL to my service 1.1</myservice-1.1>
    </test>
</config>
I modified my configuration files to split dotted properties, for example:
<some.property>some value</some.property>
to
<some><property>some value</property></some>
This way we don't have to change our code and calls to
getString("some.property") continue to work.
The problem is that for some properties like myservice-1.0, splitting would
produce invalid xml:
<myservice-1><0>URL to my service 1.0</0></myservice-1>
so my clients are broken.
So now we have to change our config files and code, or continue using
Configuration 1.0
