I use a Configuration Factory to create a Composite Configuration which points
to properties files in subdirectories. If these properties files use the include
statement to include other files, these files are expected at the root directory
instead of the directory of the properties files. 
eg:
config/config.xml (points to properties files below)
config/module1/module1.properties
config/module1/extra.properties
config/module2/module2.properties
If I want to include extra.properties in module1.properties, then I need to
write include=module1/extra.properties, which is ackward
