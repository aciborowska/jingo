When creating a SubsetConfiguration object, e.g.
conf = new SubsetConfiguration(parentConf, "myprefixwithadot.");
calls to conf.getProperty("prop") result in a call to
parent.conf(conf.getPrefix() + "prop") as expected.
However, a key iterator obtained by calling conf.getKeys() will only iterate
over keys starting with (conf.getPrefix() + "."). In the example, this will be
"myprefixwithadot..". There should not be a dot appended. 
The error is probably caused by line #283 in AbstractConfiguration.java
return key.startsWith(prefix + ".") || key.equals(prefix);
