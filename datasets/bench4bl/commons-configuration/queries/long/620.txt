The first and third code examples on the File-based Configurations page (howto_filebased.xml) are invalid. Both example create a FileBasedConfigurationBuilder with a Type parameter of Configuration:



FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<Configuration> builder =

    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<Configuration>(PropertiesConfiguration.class)

. . .



However, the Configuration Type parameter is not within bounds of the FileBasedConfigurationBuilder class since the parameter must extend FileBasedConfiguration:



public class FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<T extends  FileBasedConfiguration> extends BasicConfigurationBuilder<T>



Thus the examples need to be changed to:



FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<FileBasedConfiguration> builder =

            new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<FileBasedConfiguration>(PropertiesConfiguration.class)

. . .



I will attach a patch with the necessary corrections.
