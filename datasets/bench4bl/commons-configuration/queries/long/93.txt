FileChangedReloadingStrategy throws a NullPointerException if used with a
FileConfiguration loaded from a JAR. This is due to the null value returned by
AbstractFileConfiguration.getFile() in this case. I suggest to change the
strategy to silently ignore this case and behave like an
InvariantReloadingStrategy if the file doesn't exist.
