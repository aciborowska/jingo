When used in an EJB application deployed on Sun app server 8.1 (platform edition
8.1 build b28-beta), ConfigurationFactory throws a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
org.apache.commons.configuration.Configuration.
Sun includes Digester in at least one of the jars included with the platform,
appserv-rt.jar, so presumably Digester is being loaded by the System
classloader.  This makes Digester unable to find classes loaded by the EJB
classloader (in this case, classes in configuration-1.0.jar) unless Digester's
useContextClassLoader variable is set to true.
This patch modifies ConfigurationFactory to set useContextClassLoader to true on
the digester.
