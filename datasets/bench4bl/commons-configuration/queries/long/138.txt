A problem with correct handling of attributes in
HierarchicalConfigurationConverter caused the method testAllConfiguration() in
TestConfigurationFactory to fail if the file "test.xml" was included in the
configuration definition file.
The associated patch solves this problem. In testAllConfiguration() also a few
more asserts have been added to verify that properties have been processed
correctly.
