The attached test case succeeds in commons configuration 1.7 but fails in 1.8 and 1.9. It does succeed on trunk again, probably due to the "use properties directly" changes in SystemProperties.
As 2.0 is not yet released, it would be nice to get a 1.9.1 that is 1.9 + this bug fixed.
(The test uses the old junit framework style to be drop in compatible with 1.7, 1.8 and 1.9).
