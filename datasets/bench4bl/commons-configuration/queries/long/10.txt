According to the PropertiesConfiguration docs, multiple items are separated by
commas, and commas within a single item are escaped with a (single) backslash.
So a property "first item, second\,item" should contain two elements: "first
item" and "second,item". In the current version this doesn't work any more;
instead two backslashes are required to escape a comma.
Here is a test case for reproducing this bug:

Store this in a text file test.properties:
test = first item, second\,item
testdouble = first item, second,item

// Execute this code to reproduce the bug:
org.apache.commons.configuration.PropertiesConfiguration pc =
new org.apache.commons.configuration.PropertiesConfiguration();
pc.load(new java.io.FileInputStream("test.properties"));
// should return "2" and "second,item" but returns "3" and "second" instead
System.out.println(pc.getList("test").size());
System.out.println(pc.getList("test").get(1));
System.out.println(pc.getList("testdouble").size());
System.out.println(pc.getList("testdouble").get(1));
This behavior was tested against the latest nightly build (20040317).
