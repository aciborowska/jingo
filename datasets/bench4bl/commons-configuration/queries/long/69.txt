Hi
   I am using the 1.0 version with all other required jar like
Java 1.3
commons-collections-3.0.jar
commons-lang-2.0.jar
IDE - WSAD 5.12
When i tried to code following way which is given in example on the apache site
itself 
PropertiesConfiguration config = new PropertiesConfiguration("usergui.properties");
config.setReloadingStrategy(new FileChangedReloadingStrategy());
String[] colors = config.getStringArray("colors.pie");
for (int i=0;i<colors.length;i++)
System.out.println(colors[i]);
I am getting compile time error 
FileChangedReloadingStrategy cannot be resolved or is not a type
if i comment out above line then its getting compiled and run propely.
is it something i am missing or jar which i downloaded is not complete.
Thanks
Prashant
