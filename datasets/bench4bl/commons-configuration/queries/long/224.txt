When the property object is a List or an Array, BaseConfiguration.getProperty() returns a reference to the object contained in the store.
This means that changing that object, changes the content of the properties store without an explicit setProperty() or addProperty(). 
Also any change to the object in the store will change the object that the code has reference to, but the user is not aware that the property has changed unless he has added a ConfigurationListener.
Attached a patch to make the object returned by BaseConfiguration.getProperty() a clone of store content, to avoid side effects when changing Collection properties.
