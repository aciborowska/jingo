I had some trouble creating a ReloadingStrategy implementation (based on a JMX
reload request) : 
reloadingRequired() is called several times AFTER first returning 'true' and
before reloadingPerformed() is called. In fact, reloading process requires
access to getProperty() that itself (re)enters reload. If reloadingRequired()
doens't return false at this time, a infinite recursice loop starts.
Perhaps it is a reload() bug, that may use a boolean flag to mark
processing-reload and avoid such infinite loop in the Thread runing he reload.
