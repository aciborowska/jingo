I just found out that the actual CVS head does not contain all changes of the
latest sandbox commits. I think there was one commit, which added the class
ConfigurationXMLDocument, a corresponding test class, an enhancement of the
examples page and some smaller fixes. Obviously these changes have been lost
when moving from sandbox to proper.
With CVS view I found out that ConfigurationXMLDocument is now in the attic of
CVS, in head it is missing. The same is true for the test case
TestConfigurationXMLDocument.java. In examples.xml the last chapter about
ConfigurationXMLDocument is missing; the version, which is in the attic of the
sandbox contains this section.
Some other incosistencies that occurred to me are in the conf directory. Some of
the test configuration files for ConfigurationFactory had been modified to get
rid off the unnecessary className attribute. The actual CVS versions have this
attribute again. Here the versions in the sandbox attic are more actual.
I don't know if more changes have been lost in the move, these are the ones I
found out. If the idea is correct that they all belong to one commit, you may be
able to restore all from the CVS log.
