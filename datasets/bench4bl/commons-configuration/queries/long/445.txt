when creating a CombinedConfiguration with an overridecombiner I get into trouble when I need to generate a xml file from te resulting view. It seems that the viewNodes which are created do not handle the parent of the attributes correctly. 
So when saving this configuration the attributes get lost and attached to the rootnode.
I made a unit test and will attach the following files :

component1.xml
component1_spec.xml
AttributeTest.java
log output
