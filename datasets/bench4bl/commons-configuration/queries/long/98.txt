The method getProperties(Configuration) in the ConfigurationConverter class is
not covered by our tests, and guess what, it is broken  The javadoc for this
method states that multivalue keys are collapsed by Configuration.getString, but
getString returns only the first element of the list. That means the resulting
Properties is incomplete, list objects in the initial Configuration are not
stored as a comma separated value in the Properties as documented.
