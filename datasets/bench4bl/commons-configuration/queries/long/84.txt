Copying an XMLConfiguration using the ConfigurationUtils.copy() method does 
not work if there are repeated keys.  The end result is an XMLConfiguration 
with a majority of its properties missing because only the first property 
value for a repeated key is copied to the configuration.
This can be repeated by taking the example database tables XML file on the 
Jakarta Commons Configuration webpage, loading the configuration into an XML 
configuration, creating a new XMLConfiguration using the empty constructor, 
copying the first to the second using the ConfigurationUtils.copy() method, 
and then perform the property queries as described on the webpage.  For 
example, calling getProperty() for 'tables.table(2).name' will fail on the new 
configuration after the original configuration is copied.
This copying is the basis of my entire implementation because I want to be 
able to copy an XMLConfiguration without having to go to the operating system 
and reload a copy from disc.
