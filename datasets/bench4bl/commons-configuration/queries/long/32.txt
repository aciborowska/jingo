If an XML configuration contains a property with a '<' character or an attribute
property with a quote '"', the value is not properly escaped with < or "
in the saved configuration, resulting in an error the next time the
configuration is loaded.
For example:
conf.setProperty("foo", "1<2");
conf.setProperty("foo[@bar]", "1\"2");
conf.save();
will generate the following file:
<configuration>
    <foo bar="1"2">1<2</foo>
<configuration>
