clearXmlProperty in XMLConfiguration stops on the first element found and
doesn't examine the whole tree, that means calling clearXmlProperty on a list
property only remove the first element. For example, given the following
configuration file:
<configuration>
    <key>value1</key>
    <key>value2</key>
</configuration>
calling conf.clearProperty("key") and saving the configuration will generate the
following file instead of an empty configuration:
<configuration>
    <key>value2</key>
</configuration>
