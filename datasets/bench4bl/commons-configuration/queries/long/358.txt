With the following ini file

property.1 = g1
property.2 : g2
[section]
property.1 = l1

HierarchicalINIConfiguration properly creates two sections: null and "section".  However, the subsets from this configuration do not have the expected property names.
The global subset contains the following name=value pairs:
property..1=g1
property..2=g2
section.property..1=l1
The "section" subset contains the following name=value pairs:
property..1=g1
I expected the global subset to contain:
property.1=g1
property.2=g2
I expected the "section" subset to contain:
property.1 = l1
