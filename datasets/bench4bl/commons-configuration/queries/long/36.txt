If called with a prefix string that contains indices, the implementation of
getKeys(String) inherited from AbstractConfiguration fails to find keys with the
passed in prefix. So the returned iterator is empty.
This patch provides a specific implementation of this method for
HierarchicalConfiguration that solves this problem.
