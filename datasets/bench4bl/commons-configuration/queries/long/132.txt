I am seeing behavior in the HierarchicalConfigurationXMLReader class (v 1.5 
2004/07/05 09:54:17) where XML Comments are inappropriately stored as text 
nodes.   
When using ConfigurationXMLDocument (ConfigurationXMLDocument.java,v 1.6 
2004/06/24 14:01:03) to write the configuration back out to a file, the 
original XML comments are written out as concatenated text nodes. 
Here are the steps for recreation:
1) Read in this configuration using the hierarchicalXml designator:
<config>
    <!-- Settings for the Wizard, now externalized via Perl. -->
    <Wizard>
        <!-- Location of perl binary. -->
        <PerlPath>C:/cygwin/bin/perl</PerlPath>
        <!-- Perl script and arguments for the wizard. -->
        <WizardScript>C:/foo/wizard.pl</WizardScript>
    </Wizard>
</config>
2) Pass the HierarchicalXMLConfiguration instance to ConfigurationXMLDocument 
to write() to a file:
ConfigurationXMLDocument configDoc = new ConfigurationXMLDocument(config);
Writer out = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(outputFile));
configDoc.write(out);
3) The resulting XML (written out by Dom4J) demonstrates that all comments were 
read in and concatenated into text nodes:
<config>Settings for the Wizard, now externalized via Perl.  
  <Wizard>Location of perl binary. Perl script and arguments for the wizard.
    <PerlPath>C:/cygwin/bin/perl</PerlPath>
    <WizardScript>C:/foo/wizard.pl</WizardScript>
  </Wizard>
</config>
