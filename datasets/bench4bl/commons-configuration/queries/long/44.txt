This is a report from the Turbine developer list.
Commons configuration 1.1 logs failed JNDI lookups at ERROR level. I use the
composite configuration as follows
<configuration>
  <jndi prefix="java:comp/env"/>
  <properties fileName="WEB-INF/conf/TurbineResources.properties"/>
</configuration>
This configuration is described in the configuration-howto of Turbine.
The expected behaviour is that the entries in the JNDI context overwrite those
in the properties file. That, in turn, means, that usually only a few
configuration keys will exist in the JNDI context.
In the current version of commons-configuration (1.1) this means an error entry
in the log with every access to a not overridden configuration key (which are
the majority).
Could you please reduce the log level for this or return to the behaviour of
version 1.0 not to log this at all?
