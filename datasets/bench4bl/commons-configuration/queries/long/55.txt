I tried these properties with Configuration 1.1 stable (a
PropertiesConfiguration in a CompositeConfiguration, but that shouldn't matter)
z=1,2,3,$
{x}
,7,8
x=4,$
{y}
y=5,6
If queried using getStringArray("z") etc. this results in:
e.g. something like
String[] z = config.getStringArray("z");
for (int i = 0; i < z.length; i++) {
  System.out.println(z[i].toString());
}
1
2
3
[4, [5, 6]]
7
8
Note brackets and nesting!
I guess it would be better to flatten such multivalued keys without
brackets,commas and spaces e.g. the result should look like (note: this is
already formated a bit)
x = 4,5,6
y = 5,6
z = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
Also note that commons-configuration-src-20050926.zip nightly build behaves
different, here the result was (also preformated):
x = [4, 5]
y = [5, 6]
z = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]
Looks as if only the first value is taken when interpolating...
â€”
Besides interpolate should get called for each getter.
a = $
{b}
b = 5

One would expect config.getInt("a") == 5 instead of throwing an exception
because ${b}
 is no valid int. Of course, you can workaround by using
.getString("a") and converting manually, but this defeats the added value of all
different getters.
