This dependency:
    <!-- Fake dependency to test loading configuration files from a JAR -->
    <dependency>
      <id>resources</id>
      <version>1.0</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
kills Maven 2 because of the transitive nature of Maven2.  Maven2 if it has a dependency on a project 
gets all its dependencies as well.  So resources of course doesn't exist and fails.   Now, currently the 
Maven2 POM is created FROM the maven1 POM.  
http://www.ibiblio.org/maven2/commons-configuration/commons-configuration/1.1/commons-
configuration-1.1.pom
We need to either add a Maven2 pom, or just create a fake resources.jar, but in the commons-
configuration groupId.
