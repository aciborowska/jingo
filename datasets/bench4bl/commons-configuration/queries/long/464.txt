This is a website issue, so apologies if I'm reporting in the wrong place.
The link provided on the downloads page is 
{mirror}/commons/configuration/binaries/commons-configuration-1.7.zip whereas the actual filename has a '-bin' suffix: {mirror}
/commons/configuration/binaries/commons-configuration-1.7-bin.zip .  Can be worked around by amending the URL in the browser.
