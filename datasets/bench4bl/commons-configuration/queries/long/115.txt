In the howto sections of the configuration documentation there are still some
inconsistencies caused by lost files during the move from sandbox to proper.
This patch updates the documentation. In the XML howto document some examples
for configuration definition files used the className attribute. The patch
replaces this by the hierarchicalDom4J element. The ConfigurationFactory howto
contained the section about HierarchicalConfiguration. I removed this because it
is doublicate (also contained in the XML howto where I think it belongs).
