This bug applies when an application allows both manual editing of its 
configuration files, and  manipulation of the configuration via software. When 
saving the configuration file after changing, its file structure - file, 
section and line comments - will all be lost. Next time a human tries to edit 
the configuration file, all property documentation will be lost.
I have created a fix for this problem, applicable to PropertiesConfiguration 
and XMLPropertiesConfiguration. The fix allows these classes to preserve a 
list of comment lines preceding each property line. By default, comments are 
not preserved; in case the comment preservation is required, it should be 
enabled prior to loading the configuration file using:
AbstractFileConfiguration.setDefaultPreserveComments(true);
The fix is implemented and tested, attached as a patch file to this bug.
