The set returned from INIConfiguration.getSections() does not include the global section.  As an example,  with the following file
default = ok
dotted.var1 = default
[]
dotted.var1 = empty
var2 = empty
[section1]
dotted.var1 = foo
var2 = doodle
calling INIConfiguration.getSections()  produces a Set with elements "" and "section1".  I expected a Set with elements null,"", and "section1"
