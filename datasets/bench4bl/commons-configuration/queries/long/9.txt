When a .properties file is parsed, we only look at the last character to check
if the value is spread over several lines, but this is not sufficient. As
specified by the javadoc for java.util.Properties:
"Note that it is not  sufficient to only examine the character preceding a line
terminator sequence to see if the line terminator is escaped; there must be an
odd number of contiguous backslashes for the line terminator to be escaped.
Since the input is processed from left to right, a non-zero even number of 2n
contiguous backslashes before a line terminator (or elsewhere) encodes n
backslashes after escape processing."
Currently this file:
key1=abc
key2=xyz
is parsed as a file containing a single property:
key1 -> abc\key2=xyz
It should be parsed as a configuration containing two properties:
key1 -> abc\
key2 -> xyz
