Not sure whether this is a bug, but at least it's an issue where the
documentation differs from the actul behavior:
The CompositeConfiguration javadoc states:
"If you add Configuration1, and then Configuration2, any properties shared will
mean that Configuration1 will be returned.... If Configuration1 doesn't have the
property, then Configuration2 will be checked."
So this would mean, if a use getList or getStringArray I only get the list
elements from conf1 but not those from conf2, if the requested property is
contained in both. In reality, however, I get a combined list of the values
specified in conf1 + conf2 + any others.
I think it would be better to behave according to the documentation and to
return only the elements from the first matching configuration + any dynamically
added elements from the InMemoryConfiguration.
So, is this a bug, and will it be fixed?
