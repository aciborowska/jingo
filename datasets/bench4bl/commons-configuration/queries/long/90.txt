When I call org.apache.commons.configuration.XMLConfiguration.setProperty to 
set property, I find the relevant element in XML Document is set twice. For 
example, to call setProperty("name1", "value1") will obtain the node like 
<name1>value1value1</name1>
the value "value1" appear twice.
I find that when I call setProperty, addXMLProperty is called before 
setXMLProperty. When I comment "setXmlProperty(name, value);"(about line 347 in 
XMLConfiguration), the problem is disappeared.
