XMLConfiguration has some issues with comma (or the currently set delimiter
character) delimited lists:
1) If an XML element contains the delimiter character, it will not be splitted
into a list element, but is taken as one property whose value contains the
delimiter character.
2) If an XML element contains an escaped delimiter character, the corresponding
property's value will be the exact string, including the escaping character.
3) If properties are set whose values contain escaped delimiters, no escaping is
performed when saving the configuration into a file. Thus when it is loaded the
next time, those properties are now list properties.
