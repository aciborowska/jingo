Empty "dict" elements are not handled properly.   During printing of a configuration, configuration nodes that have no children and no value are assumed to be "strings" (see XMLPropertyListConfiguration.java:printValue()'s last "else" clause).   <dict/> is parsed in such a way (see startElement() and endElement() of that same file) that it ends up creating a configuration node with no children and no value.  Thus printing out a parsed property list will print <string>null</string> everywhere an empty dictionary was in the input.
