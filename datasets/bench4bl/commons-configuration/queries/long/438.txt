A JNDIConfiguration logs an exception when it's prefix does not exist and getKeys() is called. This is for instance the case when a JNDIConfiguration is used in a DefaultConfigurationBuilder. It does not log an exception when a key does not exist when using getProperty() (that was fixed in issue #44). This seems like an inconsistency to me. Attached patch fixes the problem by ignoring the NameNotFoundException.
