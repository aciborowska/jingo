Thomas,
you are right, the conversions between a base path, a file name, and a File are not always consistent. How did you load the configuration (this determines, which internal fields are set)?
I would recommend to work with URLs, i.e. the method getURL(). A file-based configuration's URL is always defined.
If you like, you can open a Jira ticket for this problem.
Thanks.

The file is loaded in this way:
_productConf = new ProductConfiguration();
_productConf.load(FileTools.getPathForList(_propductPathList).getPath());
means the load method gets an String and not an File.
