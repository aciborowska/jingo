After loading an INI file with HierarchicalINIConfiguration, getList() and getStringArray() alaways return 1-size sets even if the parameter is in the right form in the file. To reproduce one only need to create a small INI file with the following content :
key=val1,val2,val3
The following code returns a 1-sized list :



HierarchicalINIConfiguration c = new HierarchicalINIConfiguration();

c.load("test.ini");

List<?> l = c.getList("val");



=> l = ["val1,val2,val3"] instead of ["val1","val2","val3"]
I tried to change the list delimiter, but it didn't work. Maybe it's expected, but I haven't found anything in the doc.
