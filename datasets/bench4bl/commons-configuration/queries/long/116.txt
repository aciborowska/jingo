The setXmlProperty method in XMLConfiguration splits the key on the node
delimiter, that's the dot character, before diving into the DOM document to set
the property. It means that if the key specifies an attribute property
(foo[@bar]), the attribute name can't contain a node delimiter otherwise it'll
be truncated. For example:
setXmlProperty("foo[@bar.man]", "value");
will result in the creation of the following element:
<foo ba="value"/>
