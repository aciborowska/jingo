When I attempt to run the project.xml for any kind of jar-dependent goal on an
empty project I get the following error message:
Attempting to download maven-tasks-plugin-1.1.0.jar.
WARNING: Failed to download maven-tasks-plugin-1.1.0.jar.
Attempting to download maven-findbugs-plugin-0.7.2.jar.
WARNING: Failed to download maven-findbugs-plugin-0.7.2.jar.
The build cannot continue because of the following unsatisfied dependencies:

http://maven-plugins.sourceforge.net/maven-tasks-plugin/)

Examining the project.xml I can see that the dependencies for the SF.net maven
plugins are point to the wrong place: they should poing to the SF.net
maven-plugins repository at <http://maven-plugins.sf.net/maven>. See patch.
