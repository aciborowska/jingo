PropertiesConfiguration doesn't unescape unicode characters in the keys of the
properties. java.util.Properties does :
"Characters not in Latin1, and certain special characters, can be represented in
keys and elements using escape sequences similar to those used for character and
string literals (see ยง3.3  and ยง3.10.6  of the Java Language Specification)."
