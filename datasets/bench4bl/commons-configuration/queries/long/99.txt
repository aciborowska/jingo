When I use a string which is a directory to create a PropertiesConfiguration, no
exception is thrown.  However, the configuration is unusable as it has no
properties.
For example, I do
<code>
PropertiesConfiguration temp = 
	new PropertiesConfiguration("c:/baddirectory");
</code>
I get the expected
<code>
org.apache.commons.configuration.ConfigurationException: Cannot locate 
configuration source baddirectory 
</code>
However, when I do
PropertiesConfiguration temp2 = new 
PropertiesConfiguration("c:/windows");
I don't get any exception.  The difference between "baddirectory" and "windows"
is that the former doesn't exist and the latter does.
