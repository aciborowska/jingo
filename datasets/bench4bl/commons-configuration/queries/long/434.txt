Hi!
I am developing an application using Commons Configuration API.
And I got this problem.
In the ini file like this:
[Environment]
Application Type=any
Class Path=C:\Program Files\jar\manage.jar;C:\Program Files\jar\guiLauncher.jar;C:\Program Files\jar\appStart.jar;%USERPROFILE%;
I changed the value of 'Application Type' from 'any' to 'gui' by using class HierarchicalINIConfiguration.
The value was successfully modified, but instead the value of 'Class Path' was cut in the middle.
It is reduced like this :  'Class Path=C:\Program Files\jar\manage.jar'
In my opinion, the Configuration System regards the contents after ';' as comments, which disappeared from the file.
Is this a kind of bug? Or is there a way to show all the contents after ';' properly?
I appreciate if you give comments on this.
Thank you.
