I expect that 

    URL url = Test.class.getResource( "/Test.xml");	

    XMLConfiguration config = new XMLConfiguration();

    config.read( url.openStream());



Would read the XML file.  However it will throw a NPE at line 967

 private void load(InputSource source) throws ConfigurationException

    {

        try

        {

            URL sourceURL = locator.getSourceURL(); // <- NPE here

            if (sourceURL != null)

            {

                source.setSystemId(sourceURL.toString());

            }



I believe that testing for locator == null first will solve the problem as the rest of the code in the method does not appear to use it.
