If the property referred to from a variable contains multiple values, the
interpolation method returns all of these values. This leads to a string
representation of the list with the properties, which in most cases won't be
desired.
Because the interpolation method is called only by getString() and for
interpolating single elements of a String[] only a single value should be
returned, i.e. in case of a multi-valued property the first value (which is
consistent with the behavior of other scalar getter methods).
