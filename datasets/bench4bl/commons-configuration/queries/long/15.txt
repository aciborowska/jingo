When using ConfigurationFactory with a config.xml file that contans multiple 
properties files one can iterate through is and get each Configuration. You can 
then use one of these (Typecasting it to the proper type) directly. However, 
when for instance trying to do saveProperty with the PropertiesConfiguration it 
uses the fileName property instead of the basePath (which contains the absolute 
reference) from its superclass. This results in the file being created at 
whatever the current path is, instead of where it actually got the file in the 
first place. Propesed fix is :
    /**

Save the configuration to the file specified by the fileName attribute.
     */
    public void save() throws ConfigurationException
    {
//        save(fileName);
          save(getBasePath());
    }
