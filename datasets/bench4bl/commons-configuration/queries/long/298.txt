I'm using XMLConfiguration/XMLBeanDeclaration to construct a simple bean from an XML file. 
The bean gets filled with garbage.
A complete test case is available at: http://claywiki.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/claywiki-backyard/src/testcases/commons/config/
The same test case works with commons-configuration that is currently (2007-10-04) in trunk.
Thanks,
