BeanHelper.setDefaultBeanFactory() sets a private static field.
This is thread-hostile, because different threads cannot safely use different factories.
It's also not thread-safe, as the variable is not guaranteed to be published safely.
Should either make the variable volatile, or synchronize both getter and setter.
