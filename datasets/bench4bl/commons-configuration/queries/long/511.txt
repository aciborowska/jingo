I noticed the problem when a registered MBean method is invoked over JMX (=RMI) and it calls ConfigurationUtils.locate("some.properties").
The classloader is not able to find the resource then.
A possible fix would be to change
ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
to
ClassLoader loader = ConfigurationUtils.class.getClassLoader();
in method locateFromClasspath. But i am not sure what other Effects that would have since I have no insight into commons-configuration.
Tested with 1.6, 1.8, 1.9.
