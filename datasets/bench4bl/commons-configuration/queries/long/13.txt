I found that usign ConfigurationFactory, XMLConfiguration can't recognize a
specific encoding in XML declaration because of calling method 
"load(Reader in)" anytime, so I can use only one encoding depend on OS through
all xml files.
After finding this problem, I modified implementation to create
org.w3c.dom.Document by calling 
"DocumentBuilder#parse(new InputSource(Inputstrem in))" to avoid characters
garbled (gobbledygook), and then I confirmed to be recoginzed encoding.
I suggest to correct methods which inner class FileConfigurationDelegate in 
XMLConfiguration change to override "load(Inputstrem in)", and 
call "XMLConfiguration.this.load(Inputstrem in);", and method 
"load(InputStream in)" in XMLConfiguration change to call 
"DocumentBuilder#parse(new InputSource(Inputstrem in))".
