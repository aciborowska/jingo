It appears at least some of the user guide documentation is out of sync with the latest 2.1 version. For example, the following:
https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/userguide/howto_basicfeatures.html#Customizing_interpolation
As I understand it, StrLookup is no longer used. Also, the page refers to the  static registerGlobalLookup() method of ConfigurationInterpolator. But this method does not exist.
