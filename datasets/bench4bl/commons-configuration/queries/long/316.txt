When using the XMLConfiguration(HierarchicalConfiguration) constructor for copying an XMLConfiguration e.g. originally read from the XML string <e a="v">example</e>, the "example" text can still be retrieved from the copy using getString(""). When saving the copy to an XML file, however, the text is not written; the resulting XML string is just <configuration a="v"/>. I will attach sample code that illustrates this.
Whether it is intended that the name of the top-level element gets lost as well, I don't know (but that is not my focus here).
