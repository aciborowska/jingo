Hi,
when converting a Configuration object into a Properties object no variable
interpolation takes place. E.g. you have a PropertiesConfiguration with:
foo=bar
interpolated=$
{foo}

If you dump the Properties object or use .getProperty("interpolated") you will
get "${foo}
" instead of "bar".
If you convert the Configuration one would expect the real/interpolated values
for use with a legacy method (or just any JDK method that just takes Properties).
But as the converter uses Configuration.getList(key) that doesn't interpolate
(why does getList not interpolate?) this doesn't happen. Probably one could just
use getStringArray() instead as this method does interpolate.
Is there a reason for AbstractConfiguration.getStringArray() working differently
compared to getList() with regard to variable interpolation? At least a Javadoc
note would be good, or did one just forget to call "interpolate" in both?
Moreover it would be logical if getProperties() & related methods would allow to
specify a separator char as ", " is nice to print but is more difficult to parse
than just ",". Actually the AbstractConfiguration.setDelimiter() functionality
would make it reasonable to allow the user to modify the default also when
converting vice versa.
