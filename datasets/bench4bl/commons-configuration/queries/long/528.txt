ConfigurationInterpolator class does not load if security manager is enabled because its static initializer instantiate EnvironmentLookup which instantiate EnvironmentConfiguration which use System.getenv()in its constructor. But System.getenv() can fail if RuntimePermission("getenv.*") is not granted.
Notice this "bug" is annoying to catch because a NoClassDefFoundError is thrown when classloading ConfigurationInterpolator without the good AccessControlException showing the real source of the problem.
