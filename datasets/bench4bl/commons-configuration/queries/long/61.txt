JNDIConfiguration seems not to work with ConfigurationFactory when used in the
<additional> section. The union configuration feature of ConfigurationFactory is
implemented by calling getKeys() on a Configuration object, iterating through
the keys, and calling getProperty() for each.
JNDIConfiguration.getKeys() obviously always returns an empty iterator in my
tests though the Configuration object is not empty (getString() returns values
for some keys). I am not sure whether this is a bug in JNDIConfiguration or a
shortcomming of the JNDI implementation used for testing.
Another point is that JNDIConfiguration.getProperty() always throws a not
supported error. This would also blow ConfigurationFactory if getKeys() returned
a valid iterator. I don't understand why this error is thrown. In my opinion
this is a violation of the contract defined by the Configuration interface (the
same is true for some other methods).
Attached is an extension to the unit test of ConfigurationFactory that
demonstrates the problem.
