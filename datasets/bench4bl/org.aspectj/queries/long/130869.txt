Ok, so I'm on the bleeding edge of aspect design here... but I have a generic aspect of the form public abstract aspect MyAspect { declare warning : T.somePC() : "a match"; } and Bar is defined as: public abstract aspect Bar { public abstract pointcut somePC(); } (yes, what that enables is indeed unbelievably cool). We fail (perhaps unsurprisingly) when compiling the generic aspect because we can't find the pointcut somePC in T. We should of course be looking in the upper bound when searching for a pointcut in a type variable...
