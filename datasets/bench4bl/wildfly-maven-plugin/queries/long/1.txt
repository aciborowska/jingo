Currently with the start goal the process is destroyed when maven exits. There should be an option to keep the process running after maven starts.
Some consideration needs to be given to what to do with the console output. The plugin would own the thread which consumes the console output. It's likely not a good option for the process to inherit the I/O streams from maven process. Something will need to be done otherwise buffer overflow errors may be seen.
