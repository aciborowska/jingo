The run goal no longer works because an attempt is made to read the type of the server before the server is started. In the AbstractDeployment.execute() method an attempt is made to determine if the server is a domain server. At this point the run goal has not started the server therefore the client can't communicate with the server.
One option is to add a new isManagedDomain() method that the run goal can override. Either way a better error messages should be used when the server is potentially not running.






Current Error Message
