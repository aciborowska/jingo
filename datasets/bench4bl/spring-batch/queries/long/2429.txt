I have a job that has multiple steps and each step references a job (child jobs if you like). If I stop this job the child step in the child job gets set to a status of STOPPED as does the child job. The parent job gets set to a status of STOPPED but the parent job step that references the child job that was executing gets set to a status of COMPLETE - and this is the issue I believe. If I restart the parent job it does not restart correctly as it thinks the step that contained the child job that was STOPPED is set to COMPLETE and so it skips over it and goes to the next step. The parent job eventually completes ok but it has not processed all the data as the STOPPED child job was not restarted by the parent job and consequently all the processing has not taken place. In my case many transactions were not processed on restart.
