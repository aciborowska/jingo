In Spring Batch reference manual under this link: http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/spring-batch-docs/reference/html-single/index.html#d0e2802
in section 3.11 there is a sentence:
For this scenario, Spring Batch provides the ItemTransformer interface:
  public interface ItemProcessor<I, O> {
  O process(I item) throws Exception;
}
An ItemTransformer is very simple, given one object, transorm it and return another.
As you see, first it talkes about ItemTransformer, but then it prints ItemProcessor interface code, and then it again talks about ItemTransformer.
