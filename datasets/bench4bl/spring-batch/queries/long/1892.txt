Logically, a step should be considered complete after call to footer callback is complete. And step execution listener should come into picture after that. 
 step execution listener beforeStep -> header call back writeHeader -> step -> footer call back writeFooter -> step execution listener afterStep
However, afterStep is getting called before writeFooter call.
