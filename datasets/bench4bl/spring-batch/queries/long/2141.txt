org.springframework.batch.item.data.RepositoryItemReader.jumpToItem() is called for each partition and initiates the processing of the first page by calling results = doPageRead(); but doesn't increment the page attribute which means that page 0 is processed twice. The fix is simply to have page++ after the call to doPageRead();
