An empty <*-exception-classes/> list does not override parent's list.  This probably applies to other lists (listeners, streams, ...) as well.  This prevents a step or job from being about to inherit from a parent and remove its registered exception classes.
For example, the following results in step "B" having java.lang.Exception registered as skippable even though it specifies <skippable-exception-classes/> with merge="false" (the default).






<step id="A">




    <tasklet>




        <chunk>




            <skippable-exception-classes>




                java.lang.Exception




            </skippable-exception-classes>




        </chunk>




    </tasklet>




</step>




Â 




<step id="B" parent="A">




    <tasklet>




        <chunk>




            <skippable-exception-classes/>




        </chunk>




    </tasklet>




</step>
