Section "6.9.2.1. JdbcPagingItemReader" of the reference manual refers to a class called "org.springframework.batch.item.database.support.SimpleDelegatingPagingQueryProvider". This class doesn't exist: it looks like SqlPagingQueryProviderFactoryBean is meant instead (probably renamed before 2.0.0.RELEASE).
