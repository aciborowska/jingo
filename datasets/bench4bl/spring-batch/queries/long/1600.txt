Mode execution restarting is not stopped with mode execution stop:
The error is this line from the file:

Class: org.springframework.batch.core.launch.support. CommandLineJobRunner
method: private List<JobExecution> getJobExecutionsWithStatusGreaterThan(String jobIdentifier, BatchStatus minStatus){}.
line: 344: JobExecution jobExecution = jobExecutions.get(jobExecutions.size() - 1);

Possible fix:

line: 344: JobExecution jobExecution = jobExecutions.get(0);
