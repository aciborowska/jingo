I cloned the Batch source from Git.  When building (as per readme.md file) with Maven 3.0.3 I was unable to locate FoundryLogic.vpp:vpp:2.2.1.  I searched both Maven Central (http://mvnrepository.com/) and Sonatypes repository (https://repository.sonatype.org/) and it did not appear to be available in any public repository.
I was however able to locate it manually and put it in my repository.
