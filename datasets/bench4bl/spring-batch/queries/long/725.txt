Hello. 
I can see the description of DelegatingItemReader in Appendix A( List of ItemReaders) as following
http://static.springframework.org/spring-batch/spring-batch-docs/reference/html/apa.html#d0e4963
"Extends AbstractMethodInvokingDelegator, which enables dynamically calling of a custom method of the injected object. Provides a convenient API for dynamic method invocation shielding subclasses from the low-level details and exception handling."
I guess this description is about ItemReaderAdapter, not DelegatingItemReader. (AggregateItemReader doesn't extend AbstractMethodInvokingDelegator)
