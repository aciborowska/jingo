Very quick (<1ms) jobs are generated with non-unique parameters by "JobLauncherTestUtils.getUniqueJobParameters()" and multiple executions are found by "JdbcJobExecutionDao.getLastJobExecution(...)".
A unit test testing a quick running step with "JobLauncherTestUtils.launchStep(...)" was failing due to this issue.
I amended an existing unit test to demonstrate the issue and then made changes to "JobLauncherTestUtils.getUniqueJobParameters()" (to instead use system time in nanoseconds instead of milliseconds) and "JdbcJobExecutionDao.getLastJobExecution(...)" (to use JOB_EXECUTION_ID instead of CREATE_TIME) to address these.
A pull request will follow.
