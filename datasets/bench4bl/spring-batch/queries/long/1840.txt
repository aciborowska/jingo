When org.springframework.batch.core.step.AbstractStep fails to persist the step execution to the job repository, the step execution is set to status 'UNKNOWN'. The framework continues with the other steps of the job as if nothing happened. We ran into this issue in production: the datasource connection pool was configured insiffuciently to handle the number of parallel running batch jobs. If the step execution status was originally COMPLETED than it's probably no big deal that it's changed to UNKNOWN and the job continues with remaining steps. However in our case the steps had FAILED, and because the step execution could not be persisted to the job repository, the status was changed to UNKNOWN which causes the job to continue instead of fail.
