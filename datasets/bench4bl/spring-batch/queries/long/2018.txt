TransactionAwareBufferedWriter binds a StringBuffer to the current transaction:
TransactionSynchronizationManager.bindResource(bufferKey, new StringBuffer());
The bufferKey is computed as BUFFER_KEY_PREFIX + "." + hashCode();
The hashCode of the TransactionAwareBufferedWriter is not guaranteed to be unique, so it's possible 2 writers end up writing to the same StringBuffer.
