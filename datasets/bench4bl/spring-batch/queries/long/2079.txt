There appears to be a regression of the bug addressed in BATCH-1848.  Specifically, I am writing a query that joins several tables.  Putting a table alias prefix on the configured value for "sortKeys" causes a failure at JdbcPagingItemReader.PagingRowMapper.mapRow (JdbcPagingItemReader line 345).  Using the fix suggested in BATCH-1848 would have avoided this problem.
