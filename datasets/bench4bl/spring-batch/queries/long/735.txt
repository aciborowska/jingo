The getting-started page on the spring batch home page needs to be updated:
http://static.springframework.org/spring-batch/getting-started.html
The first option it gives people is without maven, using the 'with-dependencies' release (which is almost always buggy), followed by the 'use maven' option, which tells them to still use the same 'with-dependencies' release before (which they shouldn't)
I propose we update to have the maven option be first, with the 'no dependency' zip, followed by the 'with dependency' without maven.
