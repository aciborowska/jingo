In the example code in chapter 6 (http://static.springframework.org/spring-batch/reference/html/readersAndWriters.html) this is part of the example for the fixed length file tokenizer -
  <bean id="fixedLengthLineTokenizer"
        class="org.springframework.batch.io.file.transform.FixedLengthTokenizer">
    <property name="names" value="ISIN, Quantity, Price, Customer" />
    <property name="columns" value="1-12, 13-15, 16-20, 21-29" />
  </bean>
If you follow this example (leaving a space after the comma for each of the property names) then you are not able to use the field set readers with the name value as Spring takes the whole section between the commas. For example:
fs.readString("Quantity") would nor work whereas the same thing with a space appended to the front - fs.readString(" Quantity")
Just thought it should be made clear in the documentation as it took an amount of degugging to realise why it wouldn't recognise my list of names.
Also as an aside org.springframework.batch.io.file.transform.FixedLengthTokenizer doesn't exist it is org.springframework.batch.item.file.transform.FixedLengthTokenizer
