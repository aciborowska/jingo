In SkipLimitStepFactoryBean the code that sets the BackOffPolicy seems to be unreachable.
It is only set if the retryPolicy!=null. The retryPolicy will however never be null, as an if test prior to this test sets the retryPolicy if it is null.
In effect this is how the code works:
if(retryPolicy==null){
//set retryPolicy
}
if(retryPolicy==null && backOffPolicy!=null){
//set backofpolicy
}
In 2.0 the FaultTolerantStepFactoryBean the retryPolicy==null is taken out of the last if-statement.

I have attached a patch that makes the if statement equal to that in FaultTolerantStepFactoryBean. Not sure why the retryPolicy==null was there in the first place, so this is something the original author might want to look into before the patch is applied. Just to make sure that it doesn't interfere with some logic that was not obvious to me.
