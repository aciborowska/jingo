With 2.2 being the current version and JDK 8 released, one should be able to compile with a 1.8 JDK. 
Main issue was ASM throwing an ISE when encountering a system annotation w/ bytecode version 52 such as Target.class

Upgrade spring from 3.2.0 to 3.2.7 (ASM handling changes for 1.8)
Preseve ordering of reacheable elements (plucked from ef0823)
Added the PooledEmbeddedDataSource to address the issue outlined in SPR-11372 (plucked from b27823)
