[ERROR] /home/robo/work/sb/spring-batch/spring-batch-infrastructure/src/main/java/org/springframework/batch/item/database/ExtendedConnectionDataSourceProxy.java:[83,7] error: ExtendedConnectionDataSourceProxy is not abstract and does not override abstract method getParentLogger() in CommonDataSource
