I'm facing an issue similar to BATCH-2266, but for JobScope instead.
Caused by: org.springframework.aop.framework.AopConfigException: Could not generate CGLIB subclass of class [class $Proxy278]: Common causes of this problem include using a final class or a non-visible class; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot subclass final class class $Proxy278
The bean is annotated with @JobScope.
Looking at the commits from BATCH-2266, this fix was only for StepScope.  Do you think that the same fix is necessary for JobScope ?
