The reader keeps moving  the result set cursor while returning items from the buffer (after rollback). This means after next commit the buffer is cleared and some items from the chunk following the rollbacked chunk are skipped e.g.
read -> 1
commit
read -> 2
rollback
read ->2
commit
read -> 4 // 3 was skipped during re-reading 2
