Missing dependency / repository breaks build on fresh checkout
Thomas says:
I added the repo http://s3.amazonaws.com/maven.springframework.org/external and it worked
But we aren't supposed to depend on that repo.  Everything we need should be in http://repository.springsource.com/maven/bundles/*.  Maybe it's just for S3 deployment?
