Interfaces mentioned in summary and their implementations should be under the step package - they are just as relevant to TaskletSteps or ChunkedSteps as they are to ItemOrientedSteps
I'm also confused as to what the StepExecutionSynchronizer, et al. and StepInterruptionPolicy et al. are doing there. These seem like general step concerns, not item-related step concerns.
