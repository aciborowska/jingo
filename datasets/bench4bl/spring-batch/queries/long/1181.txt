The namespace's <step/> element always assumes it is creating a TaskletStep so it tries to set properties such as transactionManager and jobRepository.  However, the <step/> should be flexible enough to handle any implementation of Step so that if a user defines their own Step they can use it with the namespace to construct a FlowJob.
In order to resolve this issue, properties need to be removed from the <step/> element and moved to an inner element.  The new <step/> structure will be as follows:
<step>
    <tasklet>
        <chunk-tasklet/>
    </tasklet>
</step>
Where:
The <chunk-tasklet/> is the new name of what used to be <tasklet/>.  It is used to create a Chunk-Oriented TaskletStep.
The new <tasklet/> contains the properties that used to be on <step/>.  It is used to create a TaskletStep and it has a ref= that can reference a Tasklet implementation.
The <step/> contains only id=, parent=, abstract=, and flow transitions.  It can be used with any Step implementation.
