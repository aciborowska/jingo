StepInstance has lost weight over time to the point where I think it's mere existence needs to be questioned. 
Currently the only information StepInstance essentially provides is the step name. The execution count and last execution can be seen as convenience values that can be retrieved by different means - classes asking the step instance for these values (SimpleJob and StepExecutor/ChunkedStep) already have reference to the repository.
Technically it seems easy to add 'stepName' property to StepExecution and live with the pair Step+StepExecution (with already existing link StepExecution -> JobExecution -> JobInstance) rather than triple Step+StepInstance+StepExecution.
Alternatively it might be StepInstance is missing properties that would logically belong to it and justify its existence, but I can't think of any candidates.
