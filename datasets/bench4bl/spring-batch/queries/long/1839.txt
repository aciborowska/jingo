This has to do with SPR-9170. It looks like there has been an effort to migrate Spring Batch retry APIs to Spring Retry project (at least the project is there). But Spring Batch itself is not dependent on it, which means that the code base is effectively forked. Spring Batch retry APIs already look a bit more comprehensive than what is in Spring Retry.
The retry APIs are very well implemented and it is important that they get more visibility than it is now. I advocate for moving current Spring Batch retry package completely to Spring Retry.
