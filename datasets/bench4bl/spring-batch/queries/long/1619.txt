When attempting to access the executions page of the sample admin batch web app, I revcieve the following exception:
SEVERE: Servlet.service() for servlet Batch Servlet threw exception
org.apache.derby.client.am.SqlException: Syntax error: Encountered "<=" at line 1, column 337.
The generated sql statement is below:
SELECT * FROM ( SELECT E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID, E.START_TIME, E.END_TIME, E.STATUS, E.EXIT_CODE, E.EXIT_MESSAGE, E.CREATE_TIME, E.LAST_UPDATED, E.VERSION, I.JOB_INSTANCE_ID, I.JOB_NAME, ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS ROW_NUMBER FROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION E, BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE I WHERE E.JOB_INSTANCE_ID=I.JOB_INSTANCE_ID) AS TMP_SUB WHERE ROW_NUMBER <= 20
The problem is that the reference the to column alias 'ROW_NUMBER' in the where clause is missing the proper query alias. The where clause should reference the column as 'TMP_SUB.ROW_NUMBER'. 
The correct sql is below: ( BTW - I verified that the first one fails in my sql client and that the statement, with the correction applied, below does indeed work.)
SELECT * FROM ( SELECT E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID, E.START_TIME, E.END_TIME, E.STATUS, E.EXIT_CODE, E.EXIT_MESSAGE, E.CREATE_TIME, E.LAST_UPDATED, E.VERSION, I.JOB_INSTANCE_ID, I.JOB_NAME, ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS ROW_NUMBER FROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION E, BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE I WHERE E.JOB_INSTANCE_ID=I.JOB_INSTANCE_ID) AS TMP_SUB WHERE TMP_SUB.ROW_NUMBER <= 20
