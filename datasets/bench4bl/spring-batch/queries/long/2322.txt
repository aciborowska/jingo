If we have exception in ItemProcessListener#onWriteError it will be wrapped in StepListenerFailedException and since it is not in the nonRetryableExceptionClasses we will end up in infinite loop.
This exception class should be added to the list of nonRetryableExceptionClasses in FaultTolerantStepBuilder (NOTE: SkipListenerFailedException is in the list).
The same problem applies to versions 2.x.
