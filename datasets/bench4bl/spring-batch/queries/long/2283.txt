Hi,
I am using spring batch remote partitioning using rabbitmq and spring integration. 
For some of my steps, there are no input files so MultiResourcePartitioner do not create any partitions. In this case, in MessageChannelPartitionHandler.handle method, as split.size will be 0 it won't go inside for loop and wont sent any messages. But still below the for loop, it waits for response as it use 
messagingGateway.receive(replyChannel); without checking message sent or not. 
So steps for which there are no input files, steps just hangs and doesn't do anything. Ideally it should consider such steps as successful.

	public Collection<StepExecution> handle(StepExecutionSplitter stepExecutionSplitter,




			StepExecution masterStepExecution) throws Exception {




 




		Set<StepExecution> split = stepExecutionSplitter.split(masterStepExecution, gridSize);




		int count = 0;




		




		if (replyChannel == null) {




			replyChannel = new QueueChannel();




		}//end if 




		




		for (StepExecution stepExecution : split) {




			Message<StepExecutionRequest> request = createMessage(count++, split.size(), new StepExecutionRequest(




					stepName, stepExecution.getJobExecutionId(), stepExecution.getId()), replyChannel);




			if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {




				logger.debug("Sending request: " + request);




			}




			messagingGateway.send(request);




		}




 




		Message<Collection<StepExecution>> message = messagingGateway.receive(replyChannel);




		if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {




			logger.debug("Received replies: " + message);




		}




		Collection<StepExecution> result = message.getPayload();




		return result;




 




	}
