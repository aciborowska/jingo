This looks like similar problem reported on the 1.0.1 release with dependencise.
I have downloaded the spring-batch-dist-1.1.0.RELEASE-with-dependencies.zip and tried to extract using winrar and winzip on windows.
I encounter fiew problems:
1. Some of the files such as pom.xml and .classes appear twice on the same location.
2. All the files in the lib directories under a org.org.springframework.batch/1.1.0.RELEASE and all of them are named spring-batch-dist-1.1.0.RALEASE.$
