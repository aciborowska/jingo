if I configure a RepositoryItemReader and setCurrentItemCount,
 it is never used. the flow in AbstractItemCountingItemStreamItemReader is such that any set currentItemCount will never affect the initial page.
the open method always runs before the update method, but the open method depends on the update method having run first for this function to work.
this can be worked around by overriding RepositoryItemReader and implementing the Open method setting executionContext.putInt(getExecutionContextKey(READ_COUNT), getCurrentItemCount());
but its far from ideal.
the doOpen method thats clearly intended for this kind of initialization in other cases doesn't pass the executionContext so cant be used here.
