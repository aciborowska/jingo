For testing, I'm using a Map based job repository. I retrieve running JobExecutions using JobExplorer.findingRunningJobExecutions(String jobName). I then attempt to retrieve the StepExecutions from a running JobExecution, which is known to have completed steps, and the StepExecution list is empty. The Jdbc based job repository works fine.
