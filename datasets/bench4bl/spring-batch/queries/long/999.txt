JobExecution ExecutionContext should not be persisted by Step?  I can see a hopeful looking comment added in 1.1 inside SimpleJobRepository:
	public void updateExecutionContext(StepExecution stepExecution) 
{
		// Until there is an interface change (
		ecDao.persistExecutionContext(stepExecution.getJobExecution());
		ecDao.persistExecutionContext(stepExecution);
	}

We should re-visit that before 2.0 gets to a release candidate.  Caused problems for someone on the forum as well (http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=66030).
