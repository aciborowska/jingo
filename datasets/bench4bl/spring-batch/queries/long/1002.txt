Currently, the when the "next" attribute is used on a step in a job configuration with the namespace, such as the following:
	<step name="step1" next="step2"/>
	<step name="step2" />
the interpretation is as follows:
	<step name="step1">
		<next on="*" to="step2"/>
	</step>
	<step name="step2" />
However, this behavior may be confusing for users because "step2" will still execute even if "step1" fails.  Therefore, the correct default behavior should be:
	<step name="step1">
		<end on="FAILED" status="FAILED"/>
		<next on="*" to="step2"/>
	</step>
	<step name="step2" />
