This is a continuation of BATCH-761, which is closed and won't accept new attachments.  Feel free to close this as won't fix, but now that Woodstox allows disabling of "auto-closing of unmatched start elements" in versions >= 3.2.9 the attached patch against 1.1.4.RELEASE is my preferred solution to BATCH-761.  With this patch there is no burden on the Spring Batch user that chooses Woodstox >= 3.2.9 as their StAX implementation to override Spring Batch API, or even be aware that this issue ever existed.
Again apologies for the lack of a test case, but my plan is to flesh that out by taking a stab at BATCH-981 when we get a chance to migrate to 2.0.  For what it's worth we have an internal integration test case to trap this issue, and it passes with Woodstox 4.0.4 and this patch.
