In the xsd, <listeners/> is a part of the "flowType", which is a part of "job".  However, this a problem because "flowType" is also referenced by the <flow/> element.  Therefore, the xsd allows things like the following, which doesn't make sense because listeners are part of the job.
    <split id="split1" task-executor="taskExecutor">
            <flow>
                <step .../>
                <listeners>...</listeners>
            </flow>
    </split>
