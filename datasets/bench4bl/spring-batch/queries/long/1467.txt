I am trying to run the samples with H2 and no matter what it fallbacks on HSQL.
I noticed that the surefire plugin has the following configuration






<property>




  <name>org.springframework.batch.support.SystemPropertyInitializer.ENVIRONMENT</name>




  <value>${environment}</value>




</property>






However, the environment bean is defined as follows






<bean id="environment"




  class="org.springframework.batch.support.SystemPropertyInitializer">




  <property name="defaultValue" value="hsql"/>




  <property name="keyName" value="ENVIRONMENT"/>




</bean>






The right key is therefore never set (hsql always used). One possible way is to fix the pom as follows






<property>




  <name>ENVIRONMENT</name>




  <value>${environment}</value>




</property>






(On a related note, there is one test failure with H2)
