I am trying to create a simple partitioner implementation and my grid size is always 6 no matter what. I realized that it was the default value and that my configuration was not taken into account.
My config is based on the jdbcPartitionJob in the samples. Something like






<step id="partitionStep" xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch">




    <partition step="mainStep" partitioner="partitioner">




        <handler grid-size="10" task-executor="myTaskExecutor"/>




    </partition>




</step>






According to the AbstractStepParser, it expects the grid-size on the partition element and not the handler element. Unfortunately, setting that value on the partition violates the schema.
It's probably a bad copy/paste since this code is surrounded by if (handlerElement != null) {
