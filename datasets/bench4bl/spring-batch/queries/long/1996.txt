The isDelimiter(...) method on line 235 checks first to see if the index we are checking is gte the delimiter lengh. like below.
if(i >= token.length()) // where i is the index, and token is the delimiter.
This results in the first token being skipped if it is empty, resulting in the expected number of tokens not being meet.
For example, I have a file with the delimiter ''. This has a length of 3. but when index is 3, it is the 4th character being read in. so I get a first token of "''<first token>".
Perhaps we should be checking for (i >= token.length() -1).
