This issue submission is intended to be a kick-off point issue for offering feedback on naming in the M5 release.
Here are a couple off the bat from the osf.batch.execution.step.support package:
1. ListenerMulticaster breaks the XXXListener naming pattern - should this be MulticasterListener?
2. DefaultStepExecutionSynchronizerSynchronizer - this class implements StepExecutionSynchronizer, so the extra Synchronizer in the name seems extraneous
