This is a summary of the semantically significant issues I've noticed while reading through the docs so far:
1.1.3 Figure 1.1 should explain the difference between solid and dotted links
2.2 Note - "job tier can be completely missing" - really?
2.4.2 Table 2.8 StepExecution#itemCount does not include reprocessed items after rollback (docs say it does)
4.4.1.6 BatchListener no longer exists
