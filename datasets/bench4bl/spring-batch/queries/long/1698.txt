During a batch job run, a FlowExecutionException is thrown during the 'resume' method of the Simple Flow.  The nested exception shows that the Batch Execution Context is not updated properly.
The following error is displayed:
Caused by: org.springframework.jdbc.UncategorizedSQLException: PreparedStatementCallback; uncategorized SQLException for SQL [UPDATE SBATCH.BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_CONTEXT SET SHORT_CONTEXT = ?, SERIALIZED_CONTEXT = ? WHERE JOB_EXECUTION_ID = ?]; SQL state [72000]; error code [1461]; ORA-01461: can bind a LONG value only for insert into a LONG column
; nested exception is java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01461: can bind a LONG value only for insert into a LONG column.
The batch framework is responsible for updating the database repository, but it is placing a LONG value into the SHORT CONTEXT or the SERIALIZED CONTEXT.  If this problem has been solved, please let me know the bug number and version of the core jars that has this issue resolved.
