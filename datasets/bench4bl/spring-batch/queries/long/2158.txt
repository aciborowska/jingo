JdbcUtils.commonDatabaseName(source) returns "Sybase" as the database name for only the following values from metadata
Sybase SQL Server
Adaptive Server Enterprise
ASE
sql server
However the value "Sybase IQ" isn't considered in the above list. As a result, an exception is thrown when using MapJobRepositoryFactoryBean and Sybase IQ.
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: DatabaseType not found for product name: [Sybase IQ]
An alternative approach is suggested by Michael Minella to use JobRepositoryFactoryBean and explicitly setting the database type. However this needs creation of the needed metadata tables.
There is an open JIRA (https://jira.springsource.org/browse/BATCH-1611) with likely the same issue, but no information or activity. 
Please change the priority/labels as necessary.
