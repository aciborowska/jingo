If no resources were found, no resource will be set on the delegate, and the delegate won't be opened at all as expected. 
Unfortunately, the close method is always called on the delegate.
Probably it would be better to call close on the delegate only if it has been opened before.

@Override
public void close() throws ItemStreamException {
  super.close();
  if (!noInput) {    
    delegate.close();
  }  
  noInput = false;
}
