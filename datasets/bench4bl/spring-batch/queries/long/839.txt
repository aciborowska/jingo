In the reference doc under "4.4.1.6. Configuring Retry Logic" a reference is made to the deprecated StatefulRetryStepFactoryBean under the configuration showing, which is using the correct SkipLimitStepFactoryBean. It is not a big issue, but it makes the documentation confusing.
The actual reference is in the following sentence:
"The StatefulRetryStepFactoryBean requires a limit for the number of times an individual item can be retried, and a list of Exceptions that are 'retryable'."
