Several classes in Core package org.springframework.batch.core.step.item depend on infrastructure classes ItemReader and ItemWriter. However, ItemReader and ItemWriter are not core stereotypes. Conversely, infrastructure inherently depends on core.
Proposed solutions:
1) Move classes in base org.springframework.batch.item package and potentially the generic subpackages (e.g. adapter, support, transform) to the same package name but in the Core module, leaving the optional concerns in infrastructure (e.g. JMS, stax, ORM, etc.)
2) Move those same classes into the org.springframework.batch.core.step.item package
3) Completely combine core and infrastructure - honestly, you never use one without the other, why are they still separate? If you want to separate out optional concerns, do that (e.g. JMS, stax, ORM, etc.) but there's honestly no real reason to ever not have at least half the infrastructure package on your classpath (unless you think item oriented processing is evil and you only use tasklet steps, but that's a fringe concern).
I vote for (3)
Please re-examine this pre-release.
