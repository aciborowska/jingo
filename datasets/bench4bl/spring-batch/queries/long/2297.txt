As described in the link below, I tried to setup asynchronous processors and writers.
http://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/reference/html/springBatchIntegration.html#asynchronous-processors
In my case the processor is also used to filter objects, i.e. the processor can potentially return a null. This results in a NPE in the writer when it tries to write the object. 
A simple null check in the asynchronous writer when populating the final list sent to the delegate should solve this problem.
