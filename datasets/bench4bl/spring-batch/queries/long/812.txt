StepExecutionResourceProxy has some odd results when using non string JobParameters in the file path.  For example, if using a long parameter, (long) must be added to the end of the key name:
	public void testLongJobParameter() throws Exception 
{
		
		resource.setFilePattern("foo/data/%JOB_NAME%/%job.key(long)%-foo");
		jobInstance = new JobInstance(new Long(0), new JobParametersBuilder().addLong("job.key", 123L)
				.toJobParameters(), "testJob");
		JobExecution jobExecution = new JobExecution(jobInstance);
		Step step = new StepSupport("bar");
		resource.beforeStep(jobExecution.createStepExecution(step.getName()));
		doTestPathName("123-foo", "foo" + pathsep + "data" + pathsep);
	}

This is because DefaultJobParametersConverter makes this change, which makes sense when converting from the command line, but not as much in the above scenario.  I think the expected behavior is that %job.key% will convert whatever parameter has that key name to a string, regardless of the type.
