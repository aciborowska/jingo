Adding a skip-limit or a skip-policy to a chunk invalidates any custom completion policy. Looks like a reversion to a bug from 2.2 (BATCH-2096).
Easy to test. Add a custom completion policy as chunk-completion-policy, with no skip limit or skip policy set. See that it gets called. Add a skip limit or skip policy. See that your custom completion policy is no longer called.
