I'm working through some of my old examples from the prior version and tracking classes that have been renamed or removed and one that I found gone is AbstractItemWriter but its mentioned a few times in the docs.  (I'm working from the word / pdf doc that Lucas sent through for review).  I see "public class CustomItemWriter extends AbstractItemWriter implements " and a reference in the appendix.
