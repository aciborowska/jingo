The following XML configuration for a job listener does not work as the two configured methods are not called:
-------- XML - Configuration --------
<job id="...">
  ...
  <listener ref="pojoListener" before-job-method="before" after-job-method="after"/>
</job>
<bean id="pojoListener" class="com.example.MyListener"/>
--------
MyListener is a simple POJO and does not implement JobExecutionListener and has no annotated methods either.
I've debugged the problem and it seems the offending code is in the private method
AbstractListenerParser#getMethodNameAttributes
That method returns 
{"beforeJob", "afterJob"}
 instead of the XML attribute names 
{"before-job-method", "after-job-method"}
.
The unit test "JobExecutionListenerParserTests" does not seem to test this case.
I suspect that the same problem exists for Step Listeners as they share the same code base.
