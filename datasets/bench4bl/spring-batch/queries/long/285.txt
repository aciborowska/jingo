The DelimitedLineTokenizer doesn't seem to gracefully handle lines that end with a quoted value that also has extra whitespaces after the closing quote. ie:
(whitespace replaced by _)
a,b,"c"_
returns c" as the string value at index 2.
a,b,"c"__
returns "c" as the string value at index 2.
I'll attach a patch that adds both test cases to the DelimitedLineTokenizerTests class.
