Spring doesn't do type conversion to String very well, and for Date not at all.  This leads to problems for placeholders of type Date.  There are two issues in the current implementation:
  <property name="foo" value="#
{jobParameters[runDate]}
"/>
fails even if the "foo" property is of type Date because the String conversion is attempted too early; and 
  <property name="query" value="select ... where start_date > '#
{jobParameters}
'"/>
fails because the placeholder is embedded in a literal and needs to be converted to String (which Spring doesn't do natively).
