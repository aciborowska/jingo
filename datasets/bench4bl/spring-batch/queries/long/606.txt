The Spring Batch home page (http://static.springframework.org/spring-batch/batch-processing-strategies.html) has a list of links on the left hand menu. Under "Documentation" item 2 is 'User guide" which points to a non-existant page :: http://static.springframework.org/spring-batch/spring-batch-docs/reference/index.html
However http://static.springframework.org/spring-batch/spring-batch-docs/reference gives me a FTP explorer kind of layout with links to the documentation.
