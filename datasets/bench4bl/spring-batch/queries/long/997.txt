Using SVN Rev 2823 I'm running a job with a single step where one of the items read throws a non-skippable exception. This results in a step execution entry where STATUS=FAILED
EXIT_CODE=COMPLETED
EXIT_MESSAGE=[blank]
Running seme step using M3 I get
EXIT_CODE=FAILED
EXIT_MESSAGE=java.lang.RuntimeException: ...
Restarting the job ends up with a step_execution with
STATUS=COMPLETED
EXIT_CODE=EXECUTING
EXIT_MESSAGE=[blank]
For M3 this gives:
EXIT_CODE=COMPLETED
EXIT_MESSAGE=[blank]
Looks like something has changed between M3 and now where the handling of the exit state gets out of synch.
