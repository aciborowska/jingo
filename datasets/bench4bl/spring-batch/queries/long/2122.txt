When a job that has a skip limit configured hits the limit on the first item of a new chunk, the offset is not being reset.  This causes the number of items previously skipped to be skipped on restart.  For example, if a job is configured with a chunk size of 5 and items 2, 3, 7 and 11 all throw skippable exceptions, when item 11 throws it's exception, the job will fail (correct behavior).  However, on restart, the job will start at item 14 (skipping the first two chunks + the 3 offset).  This is incorrect.
