The default version of <split> used in Spring Batch uses a Synchronous TaskExecutor by default and requires the user to provide a TaskExecutor reference if they want parallel processing.  The JSR does not provide the ability to inject the thread pool and yet requires parallel execution.  So we need to provide a basic default impl when configuring via the JSR.
