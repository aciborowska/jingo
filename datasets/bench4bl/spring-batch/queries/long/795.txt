There is minor bug in JdbcJobExecutionDao.findJobExecutions(JobInstance jobInstance). JobExecutionDao's javadoc says that executions returned from this method are sorted bacwards by start time, but there is no ORDER BY clause in sql query so executions are sorted the wrong way. I didn't see ORDER BY anywhere in the file so maybe other methods should be checked too.
