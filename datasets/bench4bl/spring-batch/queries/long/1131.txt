When creating a chunk-oriented step, a "transaction-attribute"  can be configured on the <tasklet/> element.  However, since tasklet steps do not use the <tasklet/> element (they use the 'tasklet' attribute) there is no place to configure a transaction-attribute.  If the user must use Spring's "tx" namespace and provide transaction advice, then this should be mentioned in the documentation.
