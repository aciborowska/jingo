Developers find StepContext easy to locate and use, and mistakenly assume that its attributes ight be persisted (like the ExecutionContext).  It's an easy mistake to make, so maybe user defined attributes in StepContext should use an ExecutionContext, or maybe a separate API in StepContext could provide the same feature.
