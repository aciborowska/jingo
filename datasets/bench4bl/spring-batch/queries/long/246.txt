The relative path to parent pom has not been updated after the parent pom was moved to separate module - it should now be "../parent" instead of "..". 
This does not cause trouble for command-line building, but makes difference within eclipse (with correct relative path changes in one module are immediately visible in other modules, without the need to install the updated modules to repository first).
