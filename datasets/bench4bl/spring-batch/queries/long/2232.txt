Commit b26d272d436d77bb6b4d0e7320387351937a1646 changed setRepository() from 





public void setRepository(PagingAndSortingRepository repository)





 to 





public void setRepository(PagingAndSortingRepository<T, ?> repository)





.
I believe this was done in error.
For my use case I used a spring data jpa repository of type Domain but the method set with 





setMethodName()





 would return a String. With Milestone 1 I would declare a 





RepositoryItemReader<String>





, call 





setRepository()





 with my own 





JpaRepository<Domain, Long>





 and all would work as expected. With RC1 this is now impossible, because the types of the repository and the return type of the repository's query method must be the same.
