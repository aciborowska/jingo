The FlatFileItemWriter writes the footer when the ItemStream is closed.
However, for an TaskletStep the StepExecution is written to the JobRepository before the ItemStream is closed.
This means that any IOException from the FlatFileFooterCallback leaves the StepExecution marked as complete.
Dave suggests implementing the header/footer functionality via the StepExecutionListener interface in the forum post; this would mean that any exception would mark the Step as failed.
