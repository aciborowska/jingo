In the data-source-context.xml file (for the sample apps), at line 21 it says
    <!-- Set up or detect a System property called "environment" used to construct a properties file on the classpath.  The default is "hsql".  -->
But in reality the system property is called
    org.springframework.batch.support.SystemPropertyInitializer.ENVIRONMENT
as given by
