In AbstractTaskletStepBuilder we have a Set of ChunkListeners, so adding a ChunkListener twice to a Step would result in one registration. Unfortunately, in the FaultTolerantStepBuilder the method for registering ChunkListener is overridden like this:






	@Override




	public FaultTolerantStepBuilder<I, O> listener(ChunkListener listener) {




		super.listener(new TerminateOnExceptionChunkListenerDelegate(listener));




		return this;




	}






So every registration of a ChunkListener results in a different object, even if we register the same ChunkListener twice. 
Since BATCH-2077 was solved for 2.2.3 (for example) a StepExecutionListener that's also a ChunkListener would automatically be registered as a StepExecutionListener and a ChunkListener, so registering it as a ChunkListener in faulttolerant mode results in a double registration.
