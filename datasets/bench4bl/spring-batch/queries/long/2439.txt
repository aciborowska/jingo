The handle method of the JsrPartitionHandler class creates a ThreadPoolTaskExecutor locally but then it never calls shutdown or destroy before exiting from the method.  This has the effect in a standalone application of prevent the process from ending properly.  I would also assume this is a memory leak potentially in other scenarios.
I have attached a simple app that replicates the problem.  I assume you guys can get the dependencies needed to get the app to run.  
I also made the edit to spring batch core and built my own version and confirmed that it does fix the problem.
