I found a typo on the spring batch website. http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/cases/index.html
Scheduled Processing: Batch Jobs controlled by scheduler (e.g. start, stop, suspend, kill). Spring Batch does not intend to implement the scheduler concerns, but needs toprovide enough information that a scheduler can act appropriately.
toprovide is missing a space.
Hope this is helpful, keep up the great work.
