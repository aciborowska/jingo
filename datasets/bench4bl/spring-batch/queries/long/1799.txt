Scenario:
Using a FlatFileItemWriter to write into a file on full diks/memorystick. (note: there must be enough space on the disk/memorystik to create the file during the call of open() ).
What would I expect:
The step and also the job should fail, since the data could not be written into the fail, because missing space.
What happens:
The IOException is simply logged, but the step is not failing.
What is the result:
The written file is corrupt, since not complete. A restart is not possible, since the failing step actually ends with state COMPLETED.
What causes the problem:
