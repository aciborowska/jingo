Key sample jobs are very sensitive to configuration

Hibernate failure
restart
rollback
retry

Users will try similar approaches and use slightly different configuration - options like exception handler, skip limit policy, retry policy, chunk operations all could be set in a way that would break one or more of the samples without a very informative error message.  Need to go through a few combinations and see what the error is, and try and make it more obvious what has gone wrong.
