The wrong version of stax is specified in spring-batch-parent-2.0.0.RC1.pom?
This causes the build to fail, since it cannot find the package.
(infrastructure seems to activate this dependency when using jdk 1.5)
<dependency>
        <groupId>stax</groupId>
        <artifactId>stax</artifactId>
        <version>1.2</version>
        <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
