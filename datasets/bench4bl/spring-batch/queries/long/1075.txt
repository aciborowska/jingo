It is currently not possible to set allow-start-if-complete or start-limit on a TaskletStep using the namespace because the attributes are on <tasklet/> instead of step.  We should be able to do the following:
    <step id="step1" tasklet="myTasklet" allow-start-if-complete="true" start-limit="100" />
