The batchlet stop() javadoc indicates that the stop method might be called by a thread other than the one running the batchlet process method() (would be quite a trick otherwise!).  I imagine the same is true for any StoppableTasklet.
However, SystemCommandTasklet's stop() method just sets a private boolean field stopped.  As this will happen on a thread other than the one executing the tasklet (looping/sleeping/checking that field) under the JMM you need to mark the boolean field volatile to ensure that the tasklet thread will ever see the stopped = true
probably should update the StoppableTasklet javadoc as well to make that obvious (like Batchlet)
