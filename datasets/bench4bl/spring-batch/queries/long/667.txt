A question came up in the forum today that the docs did not answer. See http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=56038. DrivingQueryItemReader and KeyCollector are documented in section 8.2 but omits the information in both the javadocs and documentation on the use of setSaveState=true to make a job "CONTINUABLE".
