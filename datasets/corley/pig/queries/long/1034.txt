GROUP ... ALL and GROUP ... BY produce an alias "group".

Pig produces a syntax error if you attempt to ORDER ... BY group.

This does seem like a perfectly reasonable thing to do.

The workaround is to create an alias for group using an AS clause.  But I think this workaround should be unnecessary.

Here's sample code which elicits the syntax error:


A = load 'one.txt' using PigStorage as (one: int);

B = group A all;

C = foreach B generate
	group,
	COUNT(A) as count;

D = order C by group parallel 1; -- group is one of the aliases in C, why does this throw a syntax error?

dump D;
