TezConfiguration.TEZ_SITE_XML is made private in tez-0.7, and it is supposed to be private. 
But pig use this field

   @Override
    public JobConf getExecConf(Properties properties) throws ExecException {
        JobConf jc = super.getExecConf(properties);
        jc.addResource(TezConfiguration.TEZ_SITE_XML);
        return jc;
    }


If pig folks feel OK, the following piece of code also do the same thing, and is encouraged to do like this 

jc.addResource(new TezConfiguration());
