The actually exit code of PigLoggingTest_fp_exception when it is executed from the shell command line is 136 (run the executable and then get the exit code with "echo $?" on the command line).  However, if a Pig script like the following is run, the task logs as shown in the task's UI incorrectly list the exit code as -127.  


define X `PigLoggingTest_fp_exception 10 f` ship('./cplusplus/PigLoggingTest_fp_exception');
A = load '/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k' as (name, age, gpa);
B = stream A through X;
store B into 'results_n_30';
