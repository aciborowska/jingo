  Currently we truncate the pig script (maxScriptSize = 10240) and base64 encode it and store in config. We should remove the truncation and store the full script by compressing and then doing base64 encoding. We already do that for udfcontext, etc. It will save space as it will compress really well and will also give the full pig script while debugging.
