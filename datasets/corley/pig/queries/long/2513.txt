As compared to other tools like HIVE (which can use existing SQL-oriented tools through ODBC), Pig lacks for development tools.  Specifically, Pig's front-end has fallen behind owing to the complexity of maintaining PigPen and PigPen's being embedded in Eclipse.

I propose to create a simple web server to accompany Pig that would enable the creation of Pig sessions, and pubsub to these sessions.  Data can be returned in JSON.

This functionality would enable pig tools to flourish, while keeping presentation concerns out of Pig.
