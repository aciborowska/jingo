A continuation of PIG-3492. We realize separate validation rules (such as DuplicateForEachColumnRewriteVisitor, ImplicitSplitInsertVisitor) from optimizer would make code clear. The reason is:
1. validation rule only need to run once
2. In contrast to optimization rule, validation rule works on an inconsistent plan, and should be careful about precondition. Also some global operation such as resetSchema is not possible on inconsistent plan
3. Some operations should work with unoptimized but validated plan, such as describe

Also want to address PIG-3508 in the cleanup. We should call LogicalPlan.optimize explicitly rather than rely on HExecutionEngine.compile to do the logical plan optimization.
