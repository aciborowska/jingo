For the following pig script:

a = load ':INPATH:/singlefile/studenttab10k' as (name, age, gpa);
b = group a by name;
c = foreach b 
{ ba = filter a by age < '25'; bb = foreach ba generate gpa; generate group, flatten(bb);}

parser gives the following error message:

<line 3, column 14> mismatched input '{' expecting GENERATE

The error seems to indicate that we do not support nested foreach, which is misleading. The error message needs to be improved.
