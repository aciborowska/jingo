Trying pig e2e for the first time, I see couple of the tests (HCatDDL_1,HCatDDL_2 and Jython_Command_1) failing with 

java.io.IOException: Cannot run program /usr/local/hcat/bin/hcat:
java.io.IOException: error=2, No such file or directory

Is it ok to change the test_harness to skip these tests when hcat does not exist?
