I'm trying to run e2e(and unit) tests to run in parallel.

For "Native" e2e tests(mapred&tez), they fail randomly since the tests try to read and write from a shared space under /user/<username>/{table_testNativeMRJobSimple_input,table_testNativeMRJobSimple_output}. 

Wondering if we could get rid of this dependency.
