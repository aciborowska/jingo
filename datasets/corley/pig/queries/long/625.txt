Currently PIG has the command EXPLAIN, ILLUSTRATE and DESCRIBE. But user need to manually add/remove these lines in the script when they want to debug or see details of the job. I think there should be a wait to enable these globally. 

What I suggest is, to add -explain, -illustrate, -describe options to PIG command line. When either of these are presented, all the DUMP and STORE commands in the script are converted into EXPLAIN, ILLUSTRATE, DESCRIBE correspondingly. This makes debugging easier.
