The below script compiles and the MR plan has 3 jobs. But the script will always fail.

org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.MultiQueryOptimizer - MR plan size before optimization: 3
org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.MultiQueryOptimizer - MR plan size after optimization: 2



a0 = load 'i1' as (frcode,type:chararray,src_pty:chararray,srcpvid:chararray,src_spaceid:chararray,pageparams);
b2 = group a0 by (type, frcode) parallel 2;
b3 = foreach b2 generate COUNT_STAR(b2.$0) as num_clicks,flatten(group) ;
store b3 into 'junkout3';



The script fails due to improper reference at COUNT_STAR(b2.$0) . But this validation should be done at the compile time.
