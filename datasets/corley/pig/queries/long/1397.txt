If a script has multiple stores which can be optimized using multiquery optimization and if the script also has some file system state modifiying commands like "cp, mv, rm" then currently Gruntparser executes the plan until the filesystem command so that multiquery optimization will work on the file system after it has been modified (for example some portion of the multi query optimized script might be depending on the cp/mv or rm command to have run first). This is not done for "fs ..." commands - GruntParser should do the same even for "fs .." commands in processFsCommand()
