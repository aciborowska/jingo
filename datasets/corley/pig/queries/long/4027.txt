The ivy resolver for apache-snapshots sets checkModified="true" which updates the metadata of Tez dependencies if there are modifications, but since the intermediary Tez builds are published under the same revision (0.5.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT) the local cache will only be populated for the first time with the jars and it won't get updated afterwards.

In order to force ivy to always look up the repository whether there are changes in the Tez snapshots jars, changing="true" should be set on the Tez dependencies.

Remark: when Tez dependencies are bumped up to a stable release, this flag needs to be removed.
