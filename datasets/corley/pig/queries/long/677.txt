Currently HDataType.getWritableComparableTypes method gets the object for which a NullableXXX object needs to be returned and also the key type which indicates the data types of the incoming object. However by default the method calls DataType.findType on the incoming object which inturn does an instanceof with if-else to figure out the type. This can be avoided since the second argument, keyType, already has the type of the incoming object
