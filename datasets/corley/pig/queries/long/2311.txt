Hi,

The below script treats 'a' as bytearray thus throwing class cast exception at STRSPLIT

=========
A = load 'input.txt' using PigStorage() as (a);
A1 = filter A by NOT (a is null);
A1 = foreach A1 generate a as a:chararray ;
describe A1;
B = foreach A1 generate STRSPLIT(a);
dump B
=========

Input.txt (space separated)
=========
a b
=========

Here i am casting as "a as a:chararray". If you see the output of describe it gives

A1: 
{a: chararray}

When its passed in STRSPLIT, it treats as a bytearray thus throwing the following exception in the task logs

=======
WARN org.apache.pig.builtin.STRSPLIT: class cast exception at org.apache.pig.builtin.STRSPLIT.exec(STRSPLIT.java:55)
=======

hence giving null output at B.

If we cast 'a' using

=========
A1 = foreach A1 generate (chararray)a as a ;
=========

it gives the correct output.

((a,b))

In both the cases the describe gives 

A1: 
{a: chararray}

Anitha
