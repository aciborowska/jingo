Hi shiny pig people

I have recently been playing about with getting renjin to work as a script engine in pig in the same manner as jython / ruby etc.

Renjin is a re-implementation of R in java.

For now the renjin project is in its infancy and is probably not best suited to being bundled with pig, as such I need to be able to extend the ScriptEngine interface and register renjin as a suitable engine for pig to use.

At present the parts of pig that know about script engines are not easily changed, attached is a patch that should make this possible.

Thoughts ? ideas ?
