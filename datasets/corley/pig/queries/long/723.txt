grunt> describe lhs_grouped;
lhs_grouped: {rhs: chararray,lhs:

I think it should be:
lhs_grouped: {rhs: chararray,lhs: 
{(lhs: chararray,r: float)}
,p: float,c: float}

Because of this, we are not able to perform UNION on 2 sets because union on incompatible schemas is causing a complete loss of schema information, making further processing impossible.

This is what we want to UNION with:

grunt> asrc = LOAD 'atest.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (rhs:chararray, a:int);                    
grunt> aa = FOREACH asrc GENERATE rhs, (bag
{tuple(chararray,float)}
) null as lhs, -10F as p, -10F as c;
grunt> describe aa;
aa: {rhs: chararray,lhs: 
{(chararray,float)}
,p: float,c: float}

If there is something wrong with what I am trying to do, please let me know.
