Managing tweets information I found that someone wrote a multiline tweet in Mac OS 9 (or bellow). When exporting the text, it is not being quoted so LibreOffice can't import the cell properly (don't try Excel 2007 because it's bugged).

I suggest including the CR case in the same way as commented in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/pig/tags/release-0.12.1/contrib/piggybank/java/src/main/java/org/apache/pig/piggybank/storage/CSVExcelStorage.java?view=markup#l315
