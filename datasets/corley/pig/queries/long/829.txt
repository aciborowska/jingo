The below Pig script does not work well, when special characters are used in the DECLARE statement.

%DECLARE OUT foo.bar

x = LOAD 'something' as (a:chararray, b:chararray);

y = FILTER x BY ( a MATCHES '^.*yahoo.*$' );

STORE y INTO '$OUT';



When the above script is run in the dry run mode; the substituted file does not contain the special character.


java -cp pig.jar:/homes/viraj/hadoop-0.18.0-dev/conf -Dhod.server='' org.apache.pig.Main -r declaresp.pig



Resulting file: "declaresp.pig.substituted"

x = LOAD 'something' as (a:chararray, b:chararray);

y = FILTER x BY ( a MATCHES '^.*yahoo.*$' );

STORE y INTO 'foo';
