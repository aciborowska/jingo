It looks like the Maven jar for Pig 0.15 is built against Hadoop 1.x instead of Hadoop 2.x.
Running Pig 0.15 against a Hadoop 1 environment (which works fine in 0.14) triggers a storm of class not found exceptions for classes in Hadoop 2 (like org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/task/JobContextImpl).

The culprit seems to be the HadoopShim included in 0.15 which is different from 0.14 (and previous) - it's part of hadoop23 instead of hadoop20 package (whatever that means).

As it stands right now, using Pig 0.15 from Maven (common case) with Hadoop 1.x is impossible.
