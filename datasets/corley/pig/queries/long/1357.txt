The global sorted input splits for this feature to work properly. Prior to 0.7, all sorted input splits are globally sorted at the LOAD call on sorted table. But with the support of locally sorted input splits, PIG-1306 and PIG-1315, the globally sorted input splits need to be asked for by PIG explicitly. So this creates separate call paths for all PIG feature that require map-side-only ops. Currently there are two PIG features that require globally sorted input splits from Zebra: map-side COGROUP and map-side GROUP-BY. PIG-1315 will contain test cases for the former; while this JIRA will cover the latter.
