After each run, pig stats shown on console always shows "total bytes written : 0" even if a lot records are written. It was discussed before and it was supposed to be fixed in pig 6. However, it seems it still affects pig 9.

For example, after one run of my pig job, I got following message on screen:

Counters:
Total records written : 2
Total bytes written : 0
Spillable Memory Manager spill count : 0
Total bags proactively spilled: 0
Total records proactively spilled: 0
