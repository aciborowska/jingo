The final section of:

  http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigTypesFunctionalSpec

proposes this exact feature.  The crucial excerpt is:

The proposed solution is to change the semantics of pig, so that expression evaluation on function arguments is done before the arguments are constructed as bags of tuples, rather than afterwards. This means that the semantics would change so that SUM(salary * bonus_multiplier) means that for each tuple in grouped, the fields grouped.employee:salary and grouped.employee:bonus_multiplier will be multiplied and the result formed into tuples that are placed in a bag to be passed to the function SUM().

This would make my pig scripts significantly shorter and easier to understand.
