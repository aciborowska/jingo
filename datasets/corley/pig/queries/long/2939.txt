With sharing macros, colliding namespaces is very likely given that multiple macros from different authors might import them in the same pig script. I propose that we add namespaces to macros.

We can either add a namespace command in macros, or name the space by the filename.

This ticket is needed to facilitate sharing of macros within and between organizations and individuals in piggybank or on github or wherever.
