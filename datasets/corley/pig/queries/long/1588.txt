Pig 0.7 requires the positional variables to be escaped by a  when passed as part of a parameter value (either through cmd line param or through param_file), which was not the case in Pig 0.6 Assuming that this was not an intended breakage of backward compatibility (could not find it in release notes), this would be a bug.

For example, We need to pass
INPUT=CountWords(\\$0,\\$1,$2)

instead of simply
INPUT=CountWords($0,$1,$2)
