Hive offers this kind of thing using UDTF (User Defined Table generating Functions), it would be very useful for Pig to offer something similar, thus allowing more complex processing.

One example of such use could be an n-gram generating function.

I guess EvalFunc could be adapted/morped so exec returns an Iterator<T> instead of T.

In a first approach, the iterator scanning could be restricted to cases when the UDF is used alone in a generate clause.
