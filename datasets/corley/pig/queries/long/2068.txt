The following requirement mentioned under union-onschema section is no longer applicable -

The data type for columns with same name in different input schemas should be compatible:

    Numeric types are compatible, and if column having same name in different input schemas have different numeric types, an implicit conversion will happen.
    Bytearray type is considered compatible with all other types, a cast will be added to convert to other type.
    Bags or tuples having different inner schema are considered incompatible.
