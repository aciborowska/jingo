I have a Pig script of this form, which I used inside a workflow system such as Oozie.

A = load  '$INPUT' using PigStorage();
store A into '$OUTPUT';



I run this as with Multi-query optimization turned off :

$java -cp ~/pig-svn/trunk/pig.jar:$HADOOP_CONF_DIR org.apache.pig.Main -p INPUT=/user/viraj/junk1 -M -p OUTPUT=/user/viraj/junk2 loadpigstorage.pig

The directory "/user/viraj/junk1" is not present

I get the following results:

Input(s):
Failed to read data from "/user/viraj/junk1"
Output(s):
Failed to produce result in "/user/viraj/junk2"

This is expected, but the return code is still 0

$ echo $?
0



If I run this script with Multi-query optimization turned on, it gives, a return code of 2, which is correct.


$ java -cp ~/pig-svn/trunk/pig.jar:$HADOOP_CONF_DIR org.apache.pig.Main -p INPUT=/user/viraj/junk1 -p OUTPUT=/user/viraj/junk2 loadpigstorage.pig
...
$ echo $?
2



I believe a wrong return code from Pig, is causing Oozie to believe that Pig script succeeded.
