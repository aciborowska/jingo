pig.exec.mapPartAgg (https://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigHashBasedAggInMap) is currently only used for group by if there is any aggregation to be done. In Tez, should enable hash based grouping for normal and skewed joins, groupby with or without aggregation on the map side. This will play well with the IFile optimizations done and support for writing key and list of values (TEZ-1260) and reduce the sorting time on the map side.
