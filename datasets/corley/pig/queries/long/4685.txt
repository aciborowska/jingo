  In PIG-4683, Daniel Dai pointed out that SecondaryKeyOptimizerTez does not optimize cogroup.


// Current code does not handle more than one predecessors
        // even though it is possible. The problem is when we
        // process the first predecessor, we remove the foreach inner
        // operators from the reduce side, and the second predecessor
        // cannot see them
        if (predecessors.size()>1) {
            return;
        }



It is a tricky case and we need to see how to fix it.
