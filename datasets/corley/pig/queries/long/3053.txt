invoking <script.pl> assumes an OS specific implementation detail specific to ELF binary format and the #Unable to render embedded object: File (/bin/env perl or #) not found./bin/perl interpreter redirection behavior. This is the behavior on linux that allows script files to define their interpreters. On Windows, this tag is ignored and similar behavior is governed by the "default application" which can often be an editor – or the file may not be associated with an interpreter at all. This behavior is also triggered only on certain events such as "start" – and not generically on execution at the command-prompt.

Users who want to write cross-platform code that invokes streaming commands should invoke <interpreter> <script> explicitly to avoid issues based on platform-specifics – and to save trouble in setting execute permissions on their script files.
