  AM runs out of memory when trying to respond to getTask() calls from container for a vertex with large number of outputs (usually the case with multi-query when you group by on multiple dimensions).  Problem is with the size of payload config associated with PigProcessor, Input and Output. When there is >10 outputs size of the payload considerably increases causing memory pressure.
