In 0.8, TypeCheckingVisitor works on the old logical plan, before it is translated to new logical plan. The TypeCheckingVisitor checks the types in expressions, adds casts and tracks lineage for identifying which load function's LoadCaster interface is to be used to convert bytearrays into other types. 
As the old logical plan is going away in 0.9,  this functionality needs to be added for new plan.
