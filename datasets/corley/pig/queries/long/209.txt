Computing the inner join of a very large table (i.e., bag or mapping) with a smaller table can take time proportional to the size of the very large table. This time required can be greatly reduced if the very large table is indexed, taking time proportional to the size of the smaller table. It should be possible for clients to index tables for use by future joins.
