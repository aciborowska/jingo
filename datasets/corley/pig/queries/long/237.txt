You can run the following script multiple times and it will not produce the error second time saying that the directory already exists. If the existing file is a single file and not a directory, hadoop eventually produces an error but with directory it runs to completion.

A = load 'data';
store A into 'foo';

The validation code is missing from org/apache/pig/impl/logicalLayer/parser/QueryParser.jjt in  StoreClause() function.
