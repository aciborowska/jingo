PIG-3268 added case statement support. But conditions are currently not allowed in when branches. For example,

CASE
  WHEN i % 5 == 0 THEN '5n'
  WHEN i % 5 == 1 THEN '5n+1'
  WHEN i % 5 == 2 THEN '5n+2'
  WHEN i % 5 == 3 THEN '5n+3'
  ELSE                 '5n+4'
END


This is invalid now. However, it will be useful if it's allowed.
