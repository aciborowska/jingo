Currently the docs in http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/docs/r0.7.0/piglatin_ref2.html#FOREACH say that SAMPLE can be used as an operator in nested foreach.  It cannot.

Also, they do not mention the ability to do projections inside nested foreach, such as the following:


A = load '/Users/gates/test/data/studenttab10';
B = group A all;
C = foreach B {
    C1 = A.$0;
    C2 = distinct C1;
    generate C2;
}
dump C;
