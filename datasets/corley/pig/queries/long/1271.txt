With PIG-613, we are able to load txt files containing complex data type (map/bag/tuple) according to schema. However, the format of complex data field is very strict. User have to use pre-determined special characters to mark the beginning and end of each field, and those special characters can not be used in the content. The goals of this issue are:

1. Provide a way for user to escape special characters
2. Make it easy for users to customize Utf8StorageConverter when they have their own data format
