In skewed join, we use PartitionSkewedKeys to calculate number of reducers needed for a single key. If the result if larger than the number of total reducers, we will round it with reducer#. Eg, if Pig calculates that we need 12 reducers to hold a key in memory, and total reducers for this job is 10, we then allocate 2 reducers to this key; We shall use all 10 reducers in this case.
