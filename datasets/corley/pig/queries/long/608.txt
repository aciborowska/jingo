This is a very usual scenario: 

We are running a big pig job that contains several hadoop jobs. It has been running for long times and the first hadoop job sucess, then suddenly pig report it found a syntax error in the script after the first hadoop job...we have to repeat from the beginning.

It would be nice if pig can compile to the end of the script, find all the syntax error, type mismatch, etc., before it really starts execution.
