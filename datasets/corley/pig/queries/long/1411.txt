Due to column group structure,  Zebra can create extra files for namenode to remember. That means namenode taking more memory for Zebra related files.

The goal is to reduce the no of files/blocks

The idea among various options is to use HAR ( Hadoop Archive ). Hadoop Archive reduces the block  and file count by copying data from small files ( 1M, 2M ...) into a hdfs-block of larger size. Thus, reducing the total no. of blocks and files.
