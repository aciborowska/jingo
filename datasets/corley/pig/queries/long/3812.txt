While implementing counter support in Pig-on-Tez (PIG-3603), I made several changes to PigStats and JobStats classes. To avoid breaking backward compatibility between 0.13 and 0.13+, I'd like to commit this patch into trunk prior to 0.13 release.

The changes include-

	Move getHdfsBytes[Read|Written]() from MRPigStatsUtil to PigStatsUtil since these are not MR specific.
	Move [MAP|REDUCE]_[IN|OUT]PUT_RECORDS from MRPigStatsUtil to PigStatsUtil since Tez MRInput and MROutput also use them.
	Fix a typo in JobStats#getAvgREduceTime(): REduce -> Reduce.
	Fix white spaces.
