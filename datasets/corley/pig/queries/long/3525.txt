After PIG-3419, PigStats and ScriptState are no longer MR-specific classes. But PigStats.get() and ScriptState.get() methods still return MR-specific objects (SimplePigStats and MRScriptState respectively). We should deprecate these method and provide a new way to create appropriate objects based on the ExecType.
