There are 2 errors when building the doc target, in addition to the dependency issues as described in PIG-149.

Here are the 2 errors:


javadoc: warning - Error reading file: /homes/xu/workspace/pig-trunk/build/docs/api/${javadoc.link.java}/package-list

javadoc: error - Error while reading file /homes/xu/workspace/pig-trunk/src/overview.html



To rid of these errors, I will add an overview.html file with some overview (duh!) information about Pig and also assign a valid value to ${javadoc.link.java} in build.xml.
