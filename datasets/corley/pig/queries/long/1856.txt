The script:


A = load 'data' as (s, m);
B = order A by s parallel 2;
C = limit B 20;
store C into 'output' using org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.PigStorageSchema('\t')



where piggybank jar is in the classpath.

The script, however,  fails since the piggybank jar isn't shipped to the backend with the additional job created by the LimitAdjuster.

The workaround is to explicitly register the piggybank jar in the script.
