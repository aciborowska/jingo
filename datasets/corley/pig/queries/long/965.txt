Some frequently seen use cases of 'matches' comparison operator have follow properties -
1. The rhs is a constant string . eg "c1 matches 'abc%' "
2. Regexes such that look for matching prefix , suffix etc are very common. eg - "abc%', "%abc", '%abc%' 

To optimize for these common cases , PORegex.java can be changed to -
1. Compile the pattern (rhs of matches) re-use it if the pattern string has not changed. 
2. Use string comparisons for simple common regexes (in 2 above).

The implementation of Hive like clause uses similar optimizations.
