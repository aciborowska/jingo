If the user does not provide a default # of reducers on the operation or the script, pig estimates the number of reducers based on the input data size.  If that estimate yields > 1 reducer, then LIMIT operators can produce more results than they are supposed to.

This happens b/c the reducer estimation code (JobControlCompiler.estimateNumberOfReducers) runs after the LimitAdjuster code (MRCompiler.compile).  So, if the reducer estimation uses > 1 reducer, then the LimitAdjuster will not have added an extra 1-reducer MR job to enforce the proper limit.

This seems related to PIG-2295.
