From PIG-4417, PIG introduced a uri validation for registering which can only allow hdfs, ivy. For example, "REGISTER s3://template/abc.jar" will fail, because scheme s3 is filtered out. This patch fixes a bug in RegisterResolver.java which introduced by PIG-4417. author of PIG-4417 added one check to detect file system scheme, but it can only accept hdfs, ivy and blocked every else possible valid filesystems, like s3, ftp, etc.
