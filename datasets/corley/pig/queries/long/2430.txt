If you override getArgToFuncMapping and any of the FuncSpec's specify constructor arguments, those arguments are currently ignored. Thankfully, there is a one line fix (it's funny that this has never been run into before, but is an). Patch with tests incoming. I assume that this affects 0.10 and 0.9 but haven't tested, I was just working with trunk.
