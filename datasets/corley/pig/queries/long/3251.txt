While looking at user's OOM heap dump, noticed that pig's Bzip2TextInputFormat consumes memory at both

Bzip2TextInputFormat.buffer (ByteArrayOutputStream) 
and actual Text that is returned as line.

For example, when having one record with 160MBytes, buffer was 268MBytes and Text was 160MBytes.  

We can probably eliminate one of them.
