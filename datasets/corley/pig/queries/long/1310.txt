I've written UDFs to handle loading unix times, datemonth values and ISO 8601 formatted date strings, and working with them as ISO datetimes using jodatime.

The working code is here: http://github.com/rjurney/oink/tree/master/src/java/oink/udf/isodate/

It needs to be documented and tests added, and a couple UDFs are missing, but these work if you REGISTER the jodatime jar in your script.  Hopefully I can get this stuff in piggybank before someone else writes it this time   The rounding also may not be performant, but the code works.

Ultimately I'd also like to enable support for ISO 8601 durations.  Someone slap me if this isn't done soon, it is not much work and this should help everyone working with time series.
