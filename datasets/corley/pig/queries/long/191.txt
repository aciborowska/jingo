With the following Pig script, I would expect results_39 to contain the binary content of PigLoggingTest, but actually results_39 contains several empty files.  BinaryReadWrite.pl in this case simply reads in the binary file PigLoggingTest from STDIN and then output to STDOUT in binary.


A = load '/user/xu/test/PigLoggingTest' split by 'file';
B = stream A through `BinaryReadWrite.pl -o t`;
store B into 'results_39';
