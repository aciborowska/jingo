When an Avro file is created there exists the option to set the "String Type" to a different class than the default Utf8.
A very common situation is that the "String Type" is set to the default String class.

When trying to read such an Avro file in Pig using the AvroStorage LoadFunc from the included piggybank this gives the following Exception:

Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to org.apache.avro.util.Utf8
        at org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.avro.PigAvroDatumReader.readString(PigAvroDatumReader.java:154)
