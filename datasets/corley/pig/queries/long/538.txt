The following script is user with trunk code to simulated outer join not directly supported by pig:

A = load '/studenttab10k' as (name: chararray, age: int, gpa: float);
B = load 'votertab10k' as (name: chararray, age: int, registration: chararray, donation: float);
C = cogroup A by name, B by name;
D = foreach C generate group, (IsEmpty(A) ? '' : flatten(A)), (IsEmpty(B) ? 'null' : flatten(B));

On types branch this gives syntax error and even beyond that not supported since bincond requires that both expressions be of the same type. Santhosh suggested to have  special NULL expression that matches any type. This seems to make sense.
