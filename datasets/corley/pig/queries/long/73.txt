I am opening this new bug to track a specific work item within the broader context of improving Pig support for optimizations.
See related items:


	PIG-50 in the jira
	the design spec at: http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigExecutionModel



In particular we want to remove from the logical plan those aspects that directly relate to the execution stage of a plan, hence improving decoupling. Currently EvalSpecs and Conds (and relative pipes) are tightly coupled with logical operators.
