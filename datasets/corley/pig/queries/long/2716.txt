a = load myinput/1111/*.bz2 as (f:chararray);
b = foreach a generate INDEXOF(f,'#',0);
c = limit b 100;
dump c ;



The above script fails with the error message ;
2012-04-25 09:20:39,377 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR
1000: Error during parsing. Lexical error at line 5, column 0.  Encountered:
<EOF> after : ""

But the actual problem is in the first line. This becomes tricky to find when
my script is large and there are multiple load statements.
