In POFRJoin implementation POLocalRearrange is used to extract join keys from the input tuples. If keys match then to perform actual join input tuples are fed to Foreach which does a cross on its inputs. After keys are extracted using POLocalRearrange output; function getValueTuple(POLocalRearrange lr, Tuple tuple) is called to reconstruct the input tuple. It seems that this function call is unnecessary since we already have input tuple at that time. 

This is not a bug, but since this function would get called for every tuple, if it is eliminated, it should certainly help to improve performance.
