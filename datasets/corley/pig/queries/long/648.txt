The current record begin marker used in BinStorage is the consecutive sequence- 0x21,0x31,0x41 - these byte correspond to the ascii characters "!1A". This sequence is not very strong as a marker - this results in failures when the sequence occurs in the data - the markers should be control characters which have a high probability of not occurring in the data.
