I'm trying to use the -schema option of PigStorage.

This is what I have in the pig script
store line into '/path/to/file' using PigStorage('\t','-schema');

This is the line related to the error
2012-02-07 18:58:31,889 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 2999: Unexpected internal error. could not instantiate 'PigStorage' with arguments '[	, -schema]'
