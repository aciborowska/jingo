PigLogger initialization is missing which leads to NPE if counters are accessed during a fetch tasks. Some queries to reproduce this issue:

1.

set opt.fetch true;
A = load ...
B = foreach A generate TOBAG(TOTUPLE(null));
dump B;


-> NPE when PigWarning.SKIP_UDF_CALL_FOR_NULL is incremented

2.

set opt.fetch true;
set pig.udf.profile true;

A = load ...
B = foreach A generate [any UDF]


-> NPE when POUserFunc.INVOCATION_COUNTER is incremented
