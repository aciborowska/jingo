There appears to be a bug in AvroStorage which causes it to fail when there are field names that contain ::

For example, the following will fail:

data = load 'test.txt' as (one, two);
grp = GROUP data by (one, two);
result = foreach grp generate FLATTEN(group);                                                                                                                                                                                   
store result into 'test.avro' using org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.avro.AvroStorage();
ERROR 2999: Unexpected internal error. Illegal character in: group::one


While the following will succeed:

data = load 'test.txt' as (one, two);
grp = GROUP data by (one, two);
result = foreach grp generate FLATTEN(group) as (one,two);                                                                             
store result into 'test.avro' using org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.avro.AvroStorage();


Here is a minimal test case:

data = load 'test.txt' as (one::two, three);                                                                                                                    
store data into 'test.avro' using org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.avro.AvroStorage();
