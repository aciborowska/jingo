When the inputstream for BinStorage is at a position where the data has the record marker sequence, the code incorrectly assumes that it is at the beginning of a record (tuple) and calls DataReaderWriter.readDatum() trying to read the tuple. The problem is more likely when RandomSampleLoader (used in order by implementation) skips the input stream for sampling and calls Binstorage.getNext(). The code should be more robust in such cases
