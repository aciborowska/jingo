The pig JAR available in Apache Maven repo has been compiled with a version of Hadoop prior to 0.23.

This JAR cannot be used to run Pig against Hadoop 0.23 because of changes in the JobControl API [ie the JobControl.addJob(Job) method now is JobControl.addJob(ControlledJob), and while Job implements ControlledJob, because ControlledJob is an interface, the generated bytecode for the signature is different).

I assume we'll need 2 different versions of the JARs, one for pre 0.23 and one for post 0.23.

This affects Oozie integration with Hadoop 0.23
