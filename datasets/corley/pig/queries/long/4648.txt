The current jruby UDF implementation translates all the Java objects to ruby objects and back. This makes it very simple for ruby programmers, but it is very inefficient. I propose a second jruby implementation that passes through the Java objects to avoid this extra overhead. It should be able to re-use a lot of the existing code. The existing implementation is under org.apache.pig.scripting.jruby. I propose that the new implementation go under org.apache.pig.scripting.jruby.native and will be referenced with "using jruby-native". This is meant to reference "native" pig classes. I realize it could be confused with the Java native interface, but I couldn't think of a better name.
