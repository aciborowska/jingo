Computing aggregates over a cube of several dimensions is a common operation in data warehousing.

The standard SQL syntax is "GROUP relation BY dim1, dim2, dim3 WITH CUBE" â€“ which in addition to all dim1-2-3, produces aggregations for just dim1, just dim1 and dim2, etc. NULL is generally used to represent "all".

A presentation by Arnab Nandi describes how one might implement efficient cubing in Map-Reduce here: http://pdf.cx/44wrk

We can start with the naive solution which only works for algebraic measures, and work up from there.
