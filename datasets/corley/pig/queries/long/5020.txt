Loadcaster can be null due to bug like PIG-4974, or due to valid reasons when bytearray is returned by UDF or bytearray coming from union-ed relation with two different loadcasters.

And when casting fails at runtime, it's sometimes not straightforward to find the corresponding typecast that's failing in your script.


Caused by: org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecException: ERROR 1075: Received a bytearray from the UDF or Union from two different Loaders. Cannot determine how to convert the bytearray to string.

Maybe we can add source location when possible.
