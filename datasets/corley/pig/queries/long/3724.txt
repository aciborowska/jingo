The following command throws errors in test/e2e/pig/udfs/java/build.xml
because the hadoop classpaths are not found. 

ant -Dharness.old.pig=~/pig-0.11 
-Dharness.cluster.conf=/opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-0.20.2/conf 
-Dharness.cluster.bin=/usr/bin/hadoop 
-Dharness.hadoop.home=/opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-0.20.2  test-e2e

I have uploaded a patch which includes lib directories from build/ivy/lib/Pig to solve this problem.
