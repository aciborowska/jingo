How to set up your development environment- 

	Check out Tez trunk.
	Install protobuf 2.5.0.
	Build Tez with Hadoop 2.2.0.(By default, it builds against Hadoop trunk, which is 3.0.0.)
	Install Tez jars on local maven repository with "mvn install -DskipTests".
	Check out Pig Tez branch.
	Build Pig running "ant jar-withouthadoop".
	Set up a single-node (or multi-node) Hadoop 2.2 cluster.
	Install Tez following the instructions on the Tez homepage.
	Run Pig with "-x tez" option.



How to run Tez tests-

	unit test

ant test-tez


By default, exectype is tez, and hadoopversion is 23 in tez branch. But you can run unit tests in mr mode as follows:

ant test -Dexectype=mr -Dhadoopversion=20


	e2e tests

ant -Dharness.old.pig=$PIG_HOME -Dharness.hadoop.home=$HADOOP_HOME -Dharness.cluster.conf=$HADOOP_CONF -Dharness.cluster.bin=$HADOOP_BIN test-e2e-tez -Dhadoopversion=23
