From the schema generation code:-


        List<LogicalOperator> inputs = mPlan.getPredecessors(this);

            for (LogicalOperator op : inputs) {
                    // Create schema here
            }



The output schema is generated based on inputs determined in the logical plan. However,  mPlan.getPredecessors() doesn't always preserve the right order  (A x B and B x A result in different schemas). I suggest maintaining mInputs variable in LOCross (as it used to be) to resolve this issue.
