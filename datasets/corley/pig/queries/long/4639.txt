Currently there are two parsers for Apache HTTPD acces log files in piggybank that only allow parsing the 'combined' and 'common' logformats. These two also only parse the 'basics'.

This is proposed patch to add the existing https://github.com/nielsbasjes/logparser (Apache 2.0 license) as an 'out of the box' parser to piggybank. 
This parser parses the logfile using the LogFormat specification used to writte it. Almost all LogFormat specifiers are supported and as such adds easy parsing capabilities for (almost) all custom logformats used in production scenarios. 
This parser also goes much deeper in the sense that it allows extracting things like the value of a cookie or the value of a  query string parameter.
