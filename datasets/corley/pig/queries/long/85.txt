A PIG command like - 

store abc into 'abc' using PigStorage('\x01');

 does not recognize hat the user is requesting the data to by ^A separated. Instead the data that is stored is literally separated by the string '\x01'. 

Neither does punching in ^A directly through the editor, nor do any other strings like \u0001 help. 
Using a ^A directly through the editor complains about it being an invalid XML character and bails out.
