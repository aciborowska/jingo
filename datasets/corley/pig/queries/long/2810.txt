=== 1.txt ===
a, aa
b, bb

=== 1.pig ===
a = load '1.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (x:chararray, y);
b = filter a by $PREDICATE;
dump b;

=== 1.py ===
from org.apache.pig.scripting import Pig

compiled = Pig.compileFromFile('1.pig')
bound = compiled.bind({
    'PREDICATE' : r"\'a\' == x"
})
results = bound.runSingle()

The only thing that works is shown above, i.e. \'a\' == x

If you do any of the following
a == x
x == a
x == 'a'
x == \'a\'
Pig will throw syntax error.

It's getting only the part that's before ==
i.e. if you have x == a
then pig instantiates the following code:
b = filter a by x;
