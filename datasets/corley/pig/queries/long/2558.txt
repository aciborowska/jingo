With python embedded pig control structures, there is no way to terminate the program in the middle and set the os exit code

Here is the Pseudocode:

block 1:
   if condition check is true:
       do nothing and exit program with code 3
   else:
       call a pig 

block 2:
   if condition check is true:
       do nothing and exit program with code 0
   else:
       call a pig 

block N:
 ....


sys.exit(...) doesn't work. It is treated as exception even with sys.exit(0).
