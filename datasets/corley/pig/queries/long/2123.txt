It would be nice to have the possibility to compute and use scalar relationship inside a nested foreach block.

As an example, the following code is not currently supported by Pig.


a = LOAD 'data.txt' AS (id:chararray, num:int);                                                      
b = GROUP a BY id; 
c = FOREACH b { n = COUNT(a); d = FILTER a BY num == n; GENERATE d; };



This would be useful with LIMIT and SAMPLE as well.
