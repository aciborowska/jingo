In Pig contrib project zebra,
 When user do the union of the sorted tables, the resulting table contains a virtual column called  'source_table'.
Which allows user to know the original table name from where the content of the row of the result table is coming from.

This feature is also very useful for the case when the input tables are not sorted.

Based on the discussion with the zebra dev team, it should be easy to implement.

I am filing this enhancemnet jira for zebra.
