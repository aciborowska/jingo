Input(s):
Successfully read 0 records from: "Data/Raw/UserVisits.dat"

Output(s):
Successfully stored 0 records in: "Processed/user_visits_table"


However, when I look in the output:

$ ls -lh Processed/user_visits_table/CG0/
total 15250760
-rwxrwxrwx  1 user  _lpoperator   7.3G Sep 21 21:58 part-0*

It read a 20G input file and generated some output...

Is it that in local mode counters are not available? If so, instead of printing zeros we should print "Information Unavailable" or some such.
