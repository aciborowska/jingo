Current APIs (EvalFunc, LoadFunc and StoreFunc) have a default warn method to report counters which increments by 1. 

public final void warn(String msg, Enum warningEnum)



It would be more flexible to have an additional method that takes in an argument to increment the counter by.

public final void warn(String msg, Enum warningEnum, long incr)



This will be useful when you might have, for instance, several fields within the same row that are bad and you want the counter to reflect that. Making repetitive "warn" calls is not ideal.
