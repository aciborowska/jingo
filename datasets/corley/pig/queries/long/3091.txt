JsonMetadata currently sets schema, header and stats file to the following


    private String schemaFileName = ".pig_schema";
    private String headerFileName = ".pig_header";
    private String statFileName = ".pig_stats";



This could be made configurable so users can create custom schema files (used by custom Load/StoreFuncs)
