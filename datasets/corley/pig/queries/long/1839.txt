The XMLLoader in piggy bank always add an empty tuple. Everytime this has to be filtered out. Instead the same could be done by the loader itself.
Consider the below script :
a= load 'a.xml' using org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.XMLLoader('name');
dump a;
b= filter a by $0  is not null;
dump b;


The output of first dump is :
(<name> foobar </name>)
(<name> foo </name>)
(<name> justname </name>)
()

The output of second dump is :
(<name> foobar </name>)
(<name> foo </name>)
(<name> justname </name>)

Again another case is if I dont have a matching tag , still the loader will generate the empty tuple.
