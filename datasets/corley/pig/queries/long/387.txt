Grunt parser broken with respect to unary minus.

This script provides an example.


log = LOAD 'tutorial/data/excite-small.log' USING PigStorage('\t') as (ip, date, query);

t1 = GROUP log by ip;
describe t1;

counts = FOREACH t1 {
   cnt = COUNT(log);
   – unary minus fails
   neg = -cnt;
   – prefixing to make the negation a subtraction works
   – neg = 0-cnt;
   GENERATE group as ip, cnt as cnt, neg as key;
}
describe counts;

sorted = ORDER counts by key;
describe sorted;
dump sorted;
