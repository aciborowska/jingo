I think a new type of EvalFunc that has some notion of a transactional context would be very useful. This new TransactionalEvalFunc abstract class should have methods like initialize, onSuccess, and onFailure to mark the transaction boundaries. Such EvalFuncs would be useful for interacting with external resources. For example, to delete rows from an existing hbase table such a transactional UDF would be useful. Of course we can imitate this with a StoreFunc, but conceptually StoreFunc's are restricted to writes. If the community thinks this will be useful, I am ready to spend time on this..
