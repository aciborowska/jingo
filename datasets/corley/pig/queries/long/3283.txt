my Hadoop-2.x runs are full of log warnings of the form

2013-04-19 12:20:15,642 [JobControl] WARN  mapreduce.JobSubmitter (JobSubmitter.java:copyAndConfigureFiles(146)) - Hadoop command-line option parsing not performed. Implement the Tool interface and execute your application with ToolRunner to remedy this.



Hadoop 2 has changed the property name used to disable these warnings -the new value is mapreduce.client.genericoptionsparser.used.

It should be set on Job submission to clean the logs up
