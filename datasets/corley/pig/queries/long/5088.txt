  One user who just did union of map fields, got a skew with everything going to one input file as hashcode for map was calculated on the size. Koji Noguchi pointed out that my assumption of map hashcode being non-deterministic and can change with jdk versions is wrong as it just does a sum of hashcode of its entries.
