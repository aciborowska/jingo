When using the command history in grunt, everything looks fine until I cross a command that line wrapped. For example, the following looks fine:

grunt> data = LOAD 'input.file' USING PigStorage('\t') AS (field1, field2, fie
ld3);



but if I scroll up to the previous command, I see the following:


grunt> data = LOAD 'input.file' USING PigStorage('\t') AS (field1, field2, fie
DUMP data;



Notice that I still see the "data = LOAD ..." from the command shown before this one.
