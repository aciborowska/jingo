Pig should assign an informative name to each of the MR Job generated in Pig Physical plan. Maybe name of the relation itself. Another suggestion is to assign  name of the form "PigLatin:name:mrid", where name is the name of the query file, or 'set job.name' or PigServer.setJobName()  and mrid is an id corresponding to each MR job, and this id would be printed in output of explain command (which also shows what relations are corresponding to the MR job).
