A = load 'i1' as (a,b,c:double);
B = foreach A generate ((a eq '')?((b eq '')? (-1.0) :(c/100.0)): (c/100.0)) ;
dump B;



In Pig 0.9 the above script fails with exception : "Unsupported input type for BinCond: left hand side: tuple; right hand side: double"
The same script works fine with Pig 0.8.

I think the issue is ConstantExpression uses  Util.translateFieldSchema(DataType.determineFieldSchema(val))
which considers  (-1.0) as  a tuple rather than double in this case.
