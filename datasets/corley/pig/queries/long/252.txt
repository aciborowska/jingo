From Tom White:

I;m having a problem loading data from multiple paths in Pig. What I'm trying to do is to load data from a range of dates, so I would like to specify an input of two globbed paths:

x = LOAD '2008/05/
{26,27,28,29,30,31},2008/06/{1,2}'

Pig doesn't seem to like this though as it's trying to interpret it as a single path. The best I can do it to use UNION:

x1 = LOAD '2008/05/{26,27,28,29,30,31}
'
x2 = LOAD '2008/06/
{1,2}
'
x = UNION x1, x2

The downside to this is that I want to parameterize my paths, and having separate script for each number of paths in the input is cumbersome.

Is there a better way of doing this? Are there any plans to support multiple paths, and/or PathFilters?
