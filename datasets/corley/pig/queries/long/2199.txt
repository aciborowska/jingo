Running the data sampler tool from the penny library causes a ClassNotFoundException for a netty class.  Per the mailing list, this is because the netty classes are not accessible to Penny.

I've attached a patch that adds netty to the penny jar.

For reference, I'm running a simple script that uses pig test data from
test/org/apache/pig/test/data/InputFiles/jsTst1.txt :

    x = LOAD 'jsTst1.txt' USING PigStorage('\t');
    x_filtered = FILTER x BY (int)$1 > 100;
    STORE x_filtered INTO 'jsTst1Filtered';
