In queries such as following, where the udf in nested foreach is getting input from a non-blocking relation (eg, filter, limit), it should be possible to use the accumulative mode.


a = load 't.txt' as (f1:int,f2:int);
b = group a by f1;
c = foreach b { fa = filter a by f2 > 1; generate COUNT(fa)  ; }
explain c;
