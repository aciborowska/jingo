I am getting NPE when loading a file with AvroStorage a file that has schema like:


["null",{"type":"record","name":"TUPLE_0","fields":[{"name":"name","type":["null","string"],"doc":"autogenerated from Pig Field Schema"},{"name":"age","type":["null","int"],"doc":"autogenerated from Pig Field Schema"},{"name":"gpa","type":["null","double"],"doc":"autogenerated from Pig Field Schema"}]}]




E.g. see the e2e style test, which fails on this:


                        {
                        'num' => 4,
                        # storing file with Pig type tuple relying on conversion to record
                        # loading using stored schemas 
                        'notmq' => 1,
                        'pig' => q\
a = load ':INPATH:/singlefile/studentcomplextab10k' using PigStorage() as (m:[], t:(name:chararray, age:int, gpa:double), b:{t:(name:chararray, age:int, gpa:double)});
b = foreach a generate t;
describe b;
store b into ':OUTPATH:.intermediate' USING org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.avro.AvroStorage();

exec;

-- Read back what was stored with Avro
u = load ':OUTPATH:.intermediate' USING org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.avro.AvroStorage();
describe u;
store u into ':OUTPATH:';
\,
                        'verify_pig_script' => q\
a = load ':INPATH:/singlefile/studentcomplextab10k' using PigStorage() as (m:[], t:(name:chararray, age:int, gpa:double), b:{t:(name:chararray, age:int, gpa:double)});
b = foreach a generate t;
describe b;
store b into ':OUTPATH:';
\,
                        },
