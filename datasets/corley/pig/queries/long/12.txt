From one of the users: 
------------------------------
I'm spending a lot of time trying to optimize my pig queries for short
run-times.  This process would be much easier if, in the progress output
from pig (currently on stdout, but hopefully soon moving to  
stderr?!), the
initiation and completion of each map/reduce job could be  
timestamped.  Pig
already spits out messages of the form "----- MapReduce Job -----",  
"Input:
...", "Combine: ...", etc; could you just add a "Timestamp: ..."
field as well?	Or ideally, both "Starting timestamp: ..." and	
"Finishing
timestamp ...".

Additional comments from another user:
------------------------------------------------------

I'm adding my vote for this as well.

I'd like to know timestamp and "running time" in seconds or D;H:M:S:

Thu Oct 25 10:06:01 GMT 2007 (0:00:12:56): 56% done


Starting and stopping timestamps in the log would also be valuable.


Unforutately, there's no "workaround" such as putting a date command before and after the pig command in logging â€“
queuing times can be seconds to hours and completely mess up any notion of job execution time.
