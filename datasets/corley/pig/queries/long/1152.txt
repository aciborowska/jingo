Bincond operator throws parser error when true condition contains a constant bag with 1 tuple containing a single field of int type with -ve value. 

Here is the script to reproduce the issue

A = load 'A' as (s: chararray, x: int, y: int);
B = group A by s;
C = foreach B generate group, flatten(((COUNT(A) < 1L) ? 
{(-1)}
 : A.x));
dump C;
