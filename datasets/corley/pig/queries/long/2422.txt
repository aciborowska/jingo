In many cases, we have seen users debugging a lot of time for simple schema definition mistakes in jython udfs.
I believe adding some log messages could help users in this case.

For Ex, the below script results in exception (field row doesnt exist) in line P since the schema definition is not annotated properly (@ is missing). Also There are no error messages from the python.

register 'schemabug.py' using jython as schemabug;
A = load 'schemabugA.txt' using PigStorage() as (  x : chararray,y : chararray, z : long );
M = group A by (x, y);
N = foreach M generate schemabug.numberrows(A) as udfout; 
O = foreach N generate FLATTEN(udfout);
P = foreach O generate row.x;
dump P;


schemabug.py
------------
outputSchema("numberrows:bag
{rownum:tuple(row:tuple(x:chararray,y:chararray,z:long),number:long)}
")
def numberrows(inBag):
  outBag = []
  number = 0
  for row in inBag:
    number = number + 1
    tup = (row, number)
    outBag.append(tup)
  return outBag
