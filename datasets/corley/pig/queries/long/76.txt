Currently there are no units tests in place for Grunt. However Grunt is extensively used as part of the end-to-end tests. If some changes break Grunt, this will become evident only later on in the development process during E2E testing.

Talked to Alan and Olga, probably the best way to address this is to put in place unit tests that integrate with the test harness used for regression.
