Implement optimizations for LIMIT when other parts of Pig-on-Tez are more mature. Some of the optimizations mentioned by Daniel include:

1. If the previous stage using 1 reduce, no need to add one more vertex
2. If the limitplan is null (ie, not the "limited order by" case), we might not need a shuffle edge, a pass through edge should be enough if possible
3. Similar to PIG-1270, we can push limit to InputHandler
4. We also need to think through the "limited order by" case once "order by" is implemented
