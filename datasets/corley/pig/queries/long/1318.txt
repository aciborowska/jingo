When we are trying to use order-preserving sorted union:
....

We got the following schema, where the type of 'source_table' is (null) with no column name:

{id: chararray,name: chararray,context: chararray,writer: chararray,rev: chararray,schema: chararray,(null)}

I tried to project the 'source_table' field but failed:

B = FOREACH A GENERATE id, $6; 
DUMP B;

But then we got exception org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.FrontendException: ERROR 1066: Unable to open iterator for alias B.

Can you guys please let us know how to access this column? Or is the symptom described above is a bug?
