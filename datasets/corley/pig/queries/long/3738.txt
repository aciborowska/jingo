Newcomers to pig will undoubtedly have trouble resolving issues such as this one: PIG-3729 .

The reason being that 


	pig compiles differently for 2x and 1x
	pig has a with and without hadoop artifact



Thus, there are at least 4 different variants of the pig jar which will be relevant to different users.  

These need to be disambiguated.   And the presence/usage of hidden "provided" maven artifacts should also be illuminated .  

The place for this is probably https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PIG/Developer+Documentation , as mentioned in the last comment of the referenced (PIG-3729) JIRA. 

Although this is NOT a code bug... I think this is a very critical missing peice : and thus Ive filed this as a bug, although it really is just a documentation issue in the end.
