Pig generates a new jar file to ship over to Hadoop.  Pig has a couple of packages whitelisted that it includes from its own jar.  Pig throws away everything else.

I package all of my dependencies into a single jar file.  Pig is included in this jar file.  I do it this way because my code needs to run reliably and reproducibly in production.  Pig throws away all of my dependencies.

I don't know what the performance gain is of shaving ~5MB off of a jar that is pushed to a job tracker once and then used to run over 100s of GB of data.  The overhead is minimal on my cluster.
