Currently the end-to-end test harness requires a Postgresql database to generate expected results for many tests.  This makes it hard to install and use in automated builds and by users who don't already have postgresql installed.  As per the proposal put forth at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PIG/PigTestProposal , we need to change the test harness to test either against old versions of Pig or against alternate Pig Latin scripts.
