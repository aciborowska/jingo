As per a conversation on the Pig user list, I think it makes sense to create a PiggyBank for Python functions. To get us started, here's something short and quick I wrote to convert a bag of single item tuples to one single tuple:

@outputSchema("t:tuple()")                                                             
def bagToTuple(bag):                                                                           
  t = tuple([item[0] for item in bag])                                                 
  return t
