This behavior is important as this is a way for InputFormat to inject setup procedures that doesn't necessarily have to be exposed to the user. ie Delegation token retrieval, adding dependendencies to the distributed cache. This is especially important to HCatalog as it is an abstraction of the underlying format thus setup procedures should be kept under the covers.
