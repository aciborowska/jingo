Currently, Pig prints DAGStatus for Tez jobs every second. This generates a lot of info message in stderr. In particular, for long running jobs, every second status report seems unnecessary.

1) Every 10 seconds seems reasonable for most jobs.
2) But if the default isn't good, users should be able to configure via a property.
