Job1: grpd, all_vals, cross_result (The plan does GFCross function here for
all_vals assuming cross parallelism to be 1 taking that of the current job even
though it should consider default parallelism 199 of Job 2. Parallelism of Job1
is 1 because of group all)
Job2: cross_result (Actual CROSS of by_size and all_vals)
