When Pig was incubated, I remember a few folks expressing religious reservations about the name. Now that the Hadoop ecosystem is becoming more mature (i.e. GigaOm, TechCrunch etc know what Hadoop is), I believe the following conversation on Twitter should convince everyone that Pig should be renamed.

@alanfgates: @rjurney I look forward to seeing a #Pig app in AppStore

@rjurney: @squarecog @alanfgates Let's go for it.

@squarecog: @alanfgates @rjurney the way the market is going, I bet the three of us could get a good 5 Mil funding for that.

@rjurney: @squarecog @alanfgates Since nobody else did a Pig company, it's sort of our moral duty.

@techmilnd: @rjurney @squarecog @alanfgates ummm.. Could there be a reason why there are no "rumors" of a pig spinoff? 

@rjurney: @techmilind @squarecog @alanfgates It's gotta be the name.

@techmilind: @rjurney @squarecog @alanfgates Pig not kosher ? Ok, I will file a jira to rename it "hamster". All cool hadoop projects start with H anyway.

@squarecog: @techmilind favorited.

So, there you go. I already have a +1 from a committer (although outside of this Apache thing.)
