Pig currently allows users some control over InputFormat via the Slicer and Slice interfaces.  It does not allow any control over OutputFormat and RecordWriter interfaces.  It just allows the user to implement a storage function that controls how the data is serialized.  For hadoop tables, we will need to allow custom OutputFormats that prepare output information and objects needed by a Table store function.
