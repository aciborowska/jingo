Hi,

Script


A = load 'test.txt' using PigStorage() AS (x:int,y:int, z:int) ;
B = GROUP A BY x;
C = foreach B generate A.x as s;
describe C; -- C: {s: {(x: int)}}
D = FOREACH B {
   E = ORDER A by y;
   GENERATE A.x as s;
};
describe D; -- D: {x: int,y: int,z: int}



Here E is a dangling alias. 

Regards,
Anitha
