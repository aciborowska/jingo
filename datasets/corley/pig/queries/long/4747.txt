I am using rmf command in pig (via grunt) and no error is thrown back by grunt. However, the file is not deleted in HDFS.

rmf /user/dev_svc/FULL_SNAP/*

Is this a valid command in this environment? I guess the shell is not substituting the file names for wildcard character '*'

I expect this to delete all the files/sub-directories inside the parent directory FULL_SNAP and leave it empty.
