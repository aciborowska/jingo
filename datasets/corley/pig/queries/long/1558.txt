Going to the site directory and running ant produces:  


ant 
Buildfile: build.xml

clean:
   [delete] Deleting directory /Users/gates/src/pig/apache/site/author/build

update:

BUILD FAILED
/Users/gates/src/pig/apache/site/build.xml:6: Execute failed: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "forrest" (in directory "/Users/gates/src/pig/apache/site/author"): error=2, No such file or directory



Also, forrest here still requires Java 1.5, which can be fixed (see PIG-1508).
