I have a script which takes in a command line parameter.


pig -p number=100 script.pig



The script contains the following parameters:


A = load '/user/viraj/test' using PigStorage() as (a,b,c);

B = SAMPLE A 1/$number;

dump B;



Realistic use cases of SAMPLE require statisticians to calculate SAMPLE data on demand.

Ideally I would like to calculate SAMPLE from within Pig script without having to run one Pig script first get it's results and another to pass the results.

Ideal use case:


A = load '/user/viraj/input' using PigStorage() as (col1, col2, col3);

...
...

W = group X by col1;

Z = foreach Y generate AVG(X);

AA = load '/user/viraj/test' using PigStorage() as (a,b,c);

BB = SAMPLE AA 1/Z;

dump BB;

Change this Jira to only track sampling algorithm. PIG-1926 is opened to track limit/sample taking scalar.
