I have an input file that contains 50,000 distinct integers. Each integer is repeated twice, for a total of 100,000 lines.

Script 1, using GROUP BY to get distinct entries in the data, works:


grunt> f = load 'tmp/dupnumbers.txt';              
grunt> d = foreach (group f by $0) generate group; 
grunt> s = sample d 0.01;                          
grunt> n = foreach (group s all) generate COUNT(s);
grunt> dump n;
(493)



Script 2, using DISTINCT for the same purpose, allows sampling to be done before DISTINCT:


grunt> f = load 'tmp/dupnumbers.txt';              
grunt> d = distinct f;
grunt> s = sample d 0.01;                          
grunt> n = foreach (group s all) generate COUNT(s);
(980)
