I just figured out why the tests started with 


	ant test



had errors. I found in the logfiles that MiniDFSCluster for example expects dfs data directories that are not group-writable! So doing


	umask 0022 && ant test



makes the tests run again.

Alternatively on recent Ubuntu versions you can change USERGROUPS_ENAB in /etc/login.defs to "no"...

This should be noted somewhere in the docs.
