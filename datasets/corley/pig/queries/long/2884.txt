This section of code produces erroneous logging messages:


mro.estimatedParallelism = estimateNumberOfReducers(nwJob, mro);
// reducer estimation could return -1 if it couldn't estimate
log.info("Could not estimate number of reducers and no requested or default " +
         "parallelism set. Defaulting to 1 reducer.");
jobParallelism = mro.estimatedParallelism > 0 ? mro.estimatedParallelism : 1;



Fix is to use a if/then. Patch forthcoming.
