The "SimpleEchoStreamingCommand" string, which is an inline perl script, is unnecessarily complicated by escaping nested quote characters on the command-line.  As a result, it ends up unstable across shell implementations and operating systems.

Considering that perl has qq and can print unquoted values, this seems like it is not needed.
