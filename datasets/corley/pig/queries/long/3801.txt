Pig code explicitly runs PigOutputCommitter.storeCleanup for local jobs. We also need to add this for auto-local jobs.

To repro this problem, run-
>  a = load '2.txt' as (a0:chararray, a1:int);
>  store a into 'a' using PigStorage(',','-schema');

This creates .pig_schema file in pig -x local mode, but does not create .pig_schema file in auto-local mode.
