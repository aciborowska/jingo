There are inconsistent links to "cont.html#Parameter-Sub" throughout the documentation. For some "Parameter-Sub" is all lowercase, some have it with the case shown here. 

At least for Chrome, this results in a broken link, where the browser won't scroll to the correct section in the page.

The attached patch updates all to use the "Parameter-Sub" casing.
