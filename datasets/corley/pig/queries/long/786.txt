I have very complex Pig scripts which are often concatenations and iterations of a large number of map reduce tasks.

I've gotten into the habit of using the following construct in my code:


set job.name '$DIR/$DATE/summary.bz';

A = load ...
...
store Z into '$DIR/$DATE/summary.bz' using PigStorage();


But it would be really useful if Pig script parsing automagically set these job.name values.

Ideally I'd like to have Pig just automagically construct job names for me so I can trace execution of multihour jobs in the HOD progress pages.  Something like:


process-dates.pig
A = LOAD /data/logs/daily/20090408
...
STORE Z into mysummary/20090408/summary.bz
map-group-combiner-sort


Okay you say, I could construct this kind of job.name myself if this is what I want.

Well:

1) I'd really like to have a default constructed by Pig so I don't have to
2) Pig has information about what is happening that I don't have such as:

	The name of the script passed to Pig
	The glob expansion of the file pathname in the LOAD statement
	The execution plan of pig that would tell me what the map-group-combine-sort-reduce group looks like
	The name of intermediate STORE operations that are being performed
