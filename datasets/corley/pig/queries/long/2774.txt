A merge join can throw an OOM error if the number of duplicate left tuples is large as it accumulates all of them in memory. There are two solutions around this problem:
1. Serialize the accumulated tuples to disk if they exceed a certain size.
2. Spit out join output periodically, and re-seek on the right hand side index.
