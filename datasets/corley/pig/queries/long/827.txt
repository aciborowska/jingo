The graph operations swap, insertBetween, pushBefore, etc. have to be re-implemented in a layered fashion. The layering will facilitate the re-use of operations. In addition, use of operator.rewire in the aforementioned operations requires transaction like ability due to various pre-conditions. Often, the result of one of the operations leaves the graph in an inconsistent state for the rewire operation. Clear layering and assignment of the ability to rewire will remove these inconsistencies. For now, use of rewire has resulted in a slightly less maintainable code along with the necessity to use rewire with discretion.
