After PIG-4047, my 'svn update' command started failing with 

SVNException: svn: E155005: Directory './buildroot/lib/.svn' containing working copy admin area is missing

This is probably because we started deleting ${lib.dir} in cleanup and recreating in build.
Since ./lib directory is empty at start, shall we just take it out from svn ?
