We have a pig join between a small (16M rows) distinct table and a big (6B rows) skewed table. A regular join finishes in 2 hours (after some tweaking). We tried using skewed and been able to improve the performance to 20 minutes.

HOWEVER, when we try a bigger skewed table (19B rows), we get this message from the SAMPLER job:

Split metadata size exceeded 10000000. Aborting job job_201305151351_21573 [ScriptRunner]
at org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.split.SplitMetaInfoReader.readSplitMetaInfo(SplitMetaInfoReader.java:48)

This is reproducible every time we try using skewed, and does not happen when we use the regular join.

we tried setting mapreduce.jobtracker.split.metainfo.maxsize=-1 and we can see it's there in the job.xml file, but it doesn't change anything!

What's happening here? Is this a bug with the distribution sample created by using skewed? Why doesn't it help changing the param to -1?

Thanks!
