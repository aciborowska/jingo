Sample code 


$ cat test/foreach.pig 
daily = load 'nyse' as (exchange, symbol);
grpd = group daily by exchange;
uniquecnt = foreach grpd {
        sym = daily.symbol;
        uniq_sym = distinct sym;
        generate group, uniq_sym;
};
another = FOREACH uniquecnt GENERATE group;
explain another;




This breaks when it tries to prune uniq_sym->sym->innerload_daily
