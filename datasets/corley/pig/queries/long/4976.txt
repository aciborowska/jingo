When investigating PIG-4972, I also notice Pig job stuck when the perl script have syntax error. This happens if we have output clause in stream specification (means use a file as staging). The bug exist in both Tez and MR, and it is not a regression.

Here is an example:

define CMD `perl kk.pl` output('foo') ship('kk.pl');

A = load 'studenttab10k' as (name, age, gpa);
B = foreach A generate name;
C = stream B through CMD;
store C into 'ooo';



kk.pl is any perl script contain a syntax error.
