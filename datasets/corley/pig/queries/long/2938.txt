To reproduce the issue, run:

ant test -Dhadoopversion=23 -Dtestcase=TestAccumulator


This fails with the following error:

Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.jboss.netty.channel.group.ChannelGroup



This is a regression from PIG-2844 where netty is commented out from ivy.xml.

I guess that the intention was to exclude netty from the generated pom file, but this breaks unit tests.

I propose that we change the ivy conf of netty from "compile-> master" to "test->master" instead of commenting it out. That would prevent netty from being pulled down at compile time by 3rd party projects that consume the pig pom file.

I am speculating here, so please correct me if I am wrong.
