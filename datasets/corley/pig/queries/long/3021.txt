Suppose a(x, y)

split a into b if x==y, c otherwise;

One will expect the union of b and c will be a.  However, if x or y is null, the record won't appear in either b or c.

To workaround this, I have to change to the following:
split a into b if x is not null and y is not null and x==y, c otherwise;
