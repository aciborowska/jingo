In the current implementation, the variable names in pig script are all global variable. This make one pig script know the variable in other scripts. In my opinion, this is not right. Every relation name in pig script should be local variable, otherwise it will bring in unexpected result.  This issue relates to PIG-1423

E.g there are two pig script as follows:

Test_1.pig

a = load 'data/b.txt' ;



Test_2.pig

b = foreach a generate $0;   // "a" is recognized by Grunt although it is in Test_1.pig



And the following execute normally, do not throw any exception


PigServer pig=new PigServer(ExecType.Local);
pig.registerScript("Test_1.pig");
pig.registerScript("Test_2.pig");
