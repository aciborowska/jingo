Consider the following Pig script where we generate column names b and b in the FOREACH

DATA = LOAD 'blah.txt' as (a:long, b:long);
RESULT = FOREACH DATA GENERATE a, b, (b>20?b:0) as b;
DESCRIBE RESULT;
dump RESULT;



Pig runs the script successfully and does not complain of the duplicate column names.  I do not know if the new error handling framework will handle these kinds of cases.
