This is part of the effort to implement new load store interfaces as laid out in http://wiki.apache.org/pig/LoadStoreRedesignProposal .
PigStorage and BinStorage are now working.

SampleLoader and subclasses -RandomSampleLoader, PoissonSampleLoader need to be changed to work with new LoadFunc interface.  
Fixing SampleLoader and RandomSampleLoader will get order-by queries working.
PoissonSampleLoader is used by skew join.
