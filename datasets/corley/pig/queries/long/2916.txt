We often execute several scripts in parallel and log the messages into one log file.
If got error , we can not identify which pig script is causing it. So add a MDC with name "pig_script_file_name" and add %X
{pig_script_file_name}
 into log4j configurations, we will surely identify the errorous pig script.

the patch is attached.
