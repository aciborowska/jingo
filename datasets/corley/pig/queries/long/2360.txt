This works:

a = load 'thing';
b = foreach (group a all) {
  sorted = order a by $0;
  top = limit sorted 100;
  generate flatten(top);
}

This does not:

a = load 'thing';
b = foreach (group a all) {
  top = limit (order a by $0) 100;
  generate flatten(top);
}

It is very confusing that this syntax works fine outside of the foreach, but does not work within it. The pig grammar should seek to be as consistent and usable as possible, except when there are hard, documented limitations (such as nested foreach inside a foreach block)
