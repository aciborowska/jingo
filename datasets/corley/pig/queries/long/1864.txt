For Sample Script UDFs , there are some non -ascii charaters present. Because of this when we try to execute the sample scripts it fails with error 
ERROR 2999: Unexpected internal error. null

SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character in file '<iostream>', but no encoding declared; see http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0263.html for details
================================================================================


In the sample scripts provided in some of the line wrong characters are prsent . For example :

@outputSchema("onestring:chararray")





@outputSchema("y:bag{t:tuple(len:int,word:chararray)}") 



Requesting to have a look at all the udf examples present , since its a common practice to copy the examples directly and do a run .
