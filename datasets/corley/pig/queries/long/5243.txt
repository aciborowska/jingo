For code like 

a = load 'test.txt' as (mytuple:tuple (), gpa:float);
b = foreach a generate mytuple as (mytuple2:(name:int, age:double));
store b into '/tmp/deleteme';



describe b shows 

b: {mytuple2: (name: bytearray,age: bytearray)}



Execution wise, it is fine since there is an extra foreach typecasting the above relation.
