This is basically a more refined approach than PIG-3078, but it is also more work. That JIRA is more of a stopgap until we do something like this.

The idea would be to support something like the following:

a = load 'a' as (x,y,z);
b = load 'b'  as (x,y,z);
c = join a by x, b by x;
d = foreach c generate a::*;

Obviously this is useful for any case where you have relations with columns with various prefixes.
