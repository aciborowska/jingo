Currently If in a pig script user uses a UDF with no argument, PIG backend assumes that the UDF takes all input so at run time it passes all input as a tuple to the UDF. This assumption is incorrect, causing conceptual confusions. If a UDF takes all input, it can specify a star  as its argument. If it specify no argument at  all, then we assume that it requires no input data. 

We need to differentiate no input and all input for a UDF. Thus, in case that a UDF specify no argument, backend should pass the UDF  an empty tuple.

See notes in PIG-1586 for more information.
