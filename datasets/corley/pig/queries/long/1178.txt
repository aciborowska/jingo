The current implementation of the logical plan and the logical optimizer in Pig has proven to not be easily extensible. Developer feedback has indicated that adding new rules to the optimizer is quite burdensome. In addition, the logical plan has been an area of numerous bugs, many of which have been difficult to fix. Developers also feel that the logical plan is difficult to understand and maintain. The root cause for these issues is that a number of design decisions that were made as part of the 0.2 rewrite of the front end have now proven to be sub-optimal. The heart of this proposal is to revisit a number of those proposals and rebuild the logical plan with a simpler design that will make it much easier to maintain the logical plan as well as extend the logical optimizer.
