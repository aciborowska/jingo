When we use HCatalog as source and destination of data for Pig on Tez we get  ERROR 1115: Schema for data cannot be determined.
Pig works fine when we use map reduce or use HCatalog only as one of endpoints i.e. load data directly from file and store using HCatalog.

The error appears after upgrading from Pig 0.14 on Tez 0.5.2 to Pig 0.15 on Tez 0.7.0 ( HDP 2.2.6 to HDP 2.3.2).

To reproduce:

	create hive tables from hive_tables.hql
	load data to table_input from sample.csv
	run following Pig script on Tez





data = LOAD 'table_input' USING org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();
items_unique = DISTINCT data;

counted = FOREACH (GROUP items_unique BY col2)
	    GENERATE
	      group AS name,
	      COUNT(items_unique) AS value;
  
STORE counted INTO 'table_output' USING org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatStorer();
