Fragmented replicated join has a few limitations:

	One of the tables needs to be loaded into memory
	Join is limited to two tables



Skewed join partitions the table and joins the records in the reduce phase. It computes a histogram of the key space to account for skewing in the input records. Further, it adjusts the number of reducers depending on the key distribution.

We need to implement the skewed join in pig.
