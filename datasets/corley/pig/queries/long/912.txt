The type 'chararray' in pig does not refer to an array of characters (char []) but rather to java.lang.String
This is inconsistent and confusing naming; and additionally, will be a interoperability issue with other systems which support schema's (zebra among others).

It would be good to have a consistent naming across projects, while also having appropriate names for the various types.


Since use of 'chararray' is already widely deployed, it would be good to :

a) Add a type 'string' (or equivalent) which is an alias for 'chararray'.

Additionally, it is possible to envision these too (if deemed necessary - not a main requiremnt) :
b) Modify documentation and example scripts to use this new type.
c) Emit warnings about chararray being deprecated.
