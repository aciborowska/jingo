I am working on optimizing joins , came across new feature in HDFS "Centralized Cache Management in HDFS" , I tried to cache a dataset in hdfs and ran pig script join, but I don't see any improvement in performance, I am not sure if this feature is abstracted from pig and map reduce takes care of it or pig needs some modifications.
