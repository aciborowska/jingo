	bind methods. Currently, to explicitly bind variables to parameters, the variable type must be string:




public BoundScript bind(Map<String, String> vars) throws IOException {...}

public BoundScript bind(Map<String, Object> vars) throws IOException {...}

 

Internally Pig uses toString() method to convert variables to strings.


	fs method. Current Pig.fs(...) method doesn't return any value. Since this method just turns around to call FsShell.run() which has a return code, we should pass this return code to the user;




public static int fs(String cmd) throws IOException {...}
