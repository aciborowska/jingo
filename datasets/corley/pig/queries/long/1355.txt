Applications may not always want to write a record to a table. Zebra should allow application to do the same.

Zebra Mutipile Outputs interface allow users to stream data to different tables by inspecting the data Tuple.

So,

If ZebraOutputPartition returns -1, Zebra Multiple Outputs will skip that record and thus will not write to any table

However, Zebra BasicTableOutputFormat ( different from Zebra Multiple Outputs ) will write every record to a table
