Currently Pig distribution only bundle pig.jar for Hadoop 1. For Hadoop 2 users they need to compile again using -Dhadoopversion=23 flag. That is a quite confusing process. We need to make Pig work with Hadoop 2 out of box. I am thinking two approaches:

1. Bundle both pig-h1.jar and pig-h2.jar in distribution, and bin/pig will chose the right pig.jar to run

2. Make two Pig distributions for Hadoop 1 and Hadoop 

Any opinion?
