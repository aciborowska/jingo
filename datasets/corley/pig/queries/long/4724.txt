Even if the filter did not output any rows, since we are grouping on ALL the expected output should probably be (ALL, 0). The implementation generates a pseudo key “all” for every input on map side, thus reduce side we can combine all input together. However, this does not work for 0 input since the reduce side does not get any input. If the input is empty, yield a pseudo “all, 0” to reduce
