There are no documentations for some of the Optimization Rules, 
For ex; ColumnMapKeyPrune
in http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.8.1/piglatin_ref1.html#Optimization+Rules

And moreover I believe the documentaion should be saying how to disable these rules using -t option. 
It would be nice if the documentation could talk of some uses cases where it makes sense to disable the optimization rule.
