Pig 2.2 does not handle situatiosn where dataset is not present, as in file missing, or empty file.

It would be great if Pig would within scripts enforce some data checks.
It can be any simple command like below that can be easily wrapped around all input sources--

if ( datapath_valid && data_present && file_not_empty)  {
           run the rest of the script 
} 
else {
            throw an exception/error code  
          --this should be easily trappable valuecode in logs
}

This improvement can be beneficial for our DQ check.
