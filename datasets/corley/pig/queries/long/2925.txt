PIG-2900 made Pig match Hadoop's practice of making all JobConf properties available as environment variables for pig streaming. 

As it happens, ProcessBuilder creates a long string with all environment variables and their values on it, then runs it; having some of the weightier properties like serialized plans in the environment can make the total command length exceed OS limits. 

We propose adding a blacklist of properties which should not be added to streaming environment.
