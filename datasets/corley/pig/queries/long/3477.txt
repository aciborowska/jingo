Pig does not evaluate statements in sequence and evaluates the *nix statement (RMF, MV) encountered first and then processes the rest of the PIG statements which makes it impossible to sequentially use both PIG statements as well as Unix statements in a job.

For example:

I want to read data from A and A_new_data and store it in A, I use this

LOAD A

â€“ Read and merge A and A.new and create A_new_data

RMF A
STORE A_new_data into A 

However, RMF A runs first making the rest of my job useless. This is unexpected behavior
