Currently Pig's register command takes a local path to a dependency jar . 
This clutters the local file-system as users may forget to remove this jar later.
It would be nice if Pig supported a Gradle like notation to download the jar from a repository.
Ex: At the top of the Pig script a user could add
register '<group>:<module>:<version>'; 
It should be backward compatible and should support a local file path if so desired.
