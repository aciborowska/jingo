Cost of serialization/deserialization (sedes) can be very high and avoiding it will improve performance.

Avoid sedes when possible by implementing approach #3 proposed in http://wiki.apache.org/pig/AvoidingSedes .

The load function uses subclass of Map and DataBag which holds the serialized copy.  LoadFunction delays deserialization of map and bag types until a member function of java.util.Map or DataBag is called. 

Example of query where this will help -

l = LOAD 'file1' AS (a : int, b : map [ ]);
f = FOREACH l GENERATE udf1(a), b;      
fil = FILTER f BY $0 > 5;
dump fil; -- Serialization of column b can be delayed until here using this approach .
