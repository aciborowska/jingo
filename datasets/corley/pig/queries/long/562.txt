In parameter substitution,  the order of processing order is stated as follows:

Processing Order
   1.  Configuration files are scanned in the order they are specified on the command line. Within each file, the parameters are processed in the order they are specified.
   2.  Command line parameters are scanned in the order they are specified on the command line.

The order needs to be flipped, allowing the use of command line parameters to define values for variables declared in parameter files.
