Initially opened against Pig, but this seems to be a MR bug. 

When submitting a [MapReduce] job, the client uses the fs.default.name supplied to it by the JobTracker (via core-site.xml on the master typically) during the staging phase. After that, the client then uses the fs.default.name from it's local configs. This seems like a bug to me. Expected behavior would be to always use the local value.

I found this bug when the server configs were set to not use a FQDN for fs.default.name. This caused the client to fail because it didn't have the same default DNS domain.
