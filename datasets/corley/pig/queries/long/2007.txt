The below script when executed with version 0.9 fails with parsing error.


 ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1000: Error during parsing. <line 2, column 15> mismatched input '{' expecting GENERATE



Script1

register myudf.jar;
A = load 'test.txt' using PigStorage() as (a:int,b:chararray);
B1 = foreach A {
        C = test.TOMAP('key1',$1)#'key1';
        generate C as C;
}



The above happens when, in a nested foreach i refer to a map key directly from a udf result

The same would work if one executes without the nested foreach.

register myudf.jar;
A = load 'test.txt' using PigStorage() as (a:int,b:chararray);
B1 = foreach A generate test.TOMAP('key1',$1)#'key1';
dump B1;



Script1 works well with 0.8.
