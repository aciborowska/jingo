current impl of ColumnPruneVisitor.visit ignores field type info and passes type BYTEARRAY for all map fields.
the corrected type is pretty easy to fill in, especially since map field info is only attempted 1 level deep.

i came across this b/c i utilize the type information in the pushProjection call, and this was previously of the 'correct' type information, the change over to LogicalSchema caused a regression.
