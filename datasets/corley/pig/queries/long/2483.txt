Piggybank (and penny, actually) build differently than the rest of Pig, including Zebra. They output their builds to contrib/(piggybank,penny)/java/build, rather than (root)/build like the rest of Pig and Zebra do. This results in, for example, piggybank's compiled class files showing up in the release tarball, not just the jar.
