In PIG-1536, if a column in output of union has a source column one input of type charraray and in other it is of a numeric type, the column of numeric type will be cast to chararray. But in all other cases, chararray and numeric types are considered incompatible, and as a result such implicit casting is not done.
To be consistent with other cases, union also should consider chararray and numeric types to be incompatible.
