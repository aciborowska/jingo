Queries like:


a = load 'myfile';                                                                                            
b = group a by $0;                                                                                                                                              
c = foreach b {
    c1 = order $1 by *; 
    generate flatten(c1); 
};                                                                                                     
store c into 'outfile';



return just one key of the data instead of returning all keys.
