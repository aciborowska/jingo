Currently, the map side code is not aware which side of the cogroup it is processing so it assumes that it processes all by putting a union at the end of the pipeline. This is fairly inefficient.

A better approach would be to figure out which file is processed in confiugre call. There seems to be away to do this with hadoop but it is not documented so might not be guaranteed - need to follow up with somebody from hadoop project.

Another approach is to check it the first time map is called and to pick the execution plan that matches that part.
