When schema is provided, one can avoid the loop and switch case statements to typecast the fields.  This is kind of tricky to do with minimal code change as code replacement needs to be done in different places for different LoadFunc/StoreFuncs. For eg: In case of PigStorage, the change is required in getNext() method. In case of piggybank AvroStorage, change is required in PigAvroDatumReader and PigAvroDatumWriter classes.
