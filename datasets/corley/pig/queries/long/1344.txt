With Pig 0.7, the TextDataParser has been removed and the logic to parse complex data types has moved to Utf8StorageConverter. However, this does not handle the case where the complex data types could contain delimiters ('
{', '}
', ',', '(', ')', '[', ']', '#'). Fixing this issue will make PigStorage self contained and more usable.
