In Pig-335, the lineage design states that UDFs that return bytearrays could cause problems in tracing the lineage. For UDFs that do not return bytearray, the lineage design should pickup the right load function to use as long as there is no ambiguity.  In the current implementation, we could have issues with scripts like:


a = load 'input' as (field1);
b = foreach a generate myudf_to_double(field1);
c =  foreach b generate $0 + 2.0;



When $0 has to be cast to a double, the lineage code will complain that it hit a UDF and hence cannot determine the right load function to use.
