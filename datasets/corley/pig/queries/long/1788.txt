Issue 1


grunt> l = load 'x' as (a,b,c);        
grunt> g = group l by a;
grunt> f = foreach g generate COUNT(g);       -- g is unintentionally being used as scalar , the user intends it to be COUNT(l) .

Since the user did not intend to use a scalar, the scalar error messages are hard to understand. 
It will be useful to have the relation being used in scalar context in the error message. Something like - "ERROR 1000: Error during parsing. Relation g being used in scalar context at ... .Scalars can be only used with projections"

Issue 2
The error message "Scalars can be only used with projections" is not easy to understand. A better error message is needed, something like "A column needs to be projected from relation used in scalar context."
