We're currently using CircularFifoQueue in InterRecordReader, and it comes from commons-collections4 dependency. Hadoop 2.8 installations do not have this dependency by default, so for now we should switch to the older CircularFifoBuffer instead (which comes from commons-collections and it's present).

We should open a separate ticket for investigating what libraries should we update.
