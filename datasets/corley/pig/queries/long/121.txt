Setting the cluster cause a NPE exception in PigContext in line 214.

$ java -cp pig.jar org.apache.pig.Main -x mapreduce -c localhost
Changing MR cluster to localhost
08/02/24 20:08:44 ERROR pig.Main: java.lang.NullPointerException

Main line 109 calls   
pigContext.setJobtrackerLocation(cluster);
In line 214 in PigContext executionEngine.updateConfiguration(trackerLocation) is called. However executionEngine is still null, since connect is not called first. 
I guess so far people did set cluster and name node as system properties or it was set by the perl script instead of using the -c parameter. 
Within the HExecutionEngine#init the system property was used to connect to the hadoop cluster. 
Looks like HExecutionEngine, PigContext and PigServer need some refactoring to clean up those things. 

I'm happy to offer help here, but I'm not sure if we have enough patch credibility yet.
