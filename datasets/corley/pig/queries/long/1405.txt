There are currently a number of functions in Piggybank that represent features commonly supported by languages and database engines.  We need to decide which of these Pig should support as built in functions and put them in org.apache.pig.builtin.  This will also mean adding unit tests and javadocs for some UDFs.  The existing classes will be left in Piggybank for some time for backward compatibility.
