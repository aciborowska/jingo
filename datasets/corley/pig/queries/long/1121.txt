In the following pig script, if user do 
b =  foreach a generate m1#'a' ; 

describe b will be:
b: 
{bytearray}
zebra store will fail, since there is no name passed to zebra, and zebra not only need type but also name in order to store. 

=========
If user do 
b =  foreach a generate m1#'a' as ms1;

describe b will be:
b: 
{ms1: bytearray}

Then zebra store can be succeeded. 

=========
Here is the full pig script. 
register /grid/0/dev/hadoopqa/jars/zebra.jar;
a = load '1.txt' as (a:int, b:float,c:long,d:double,e:chararray,f:bytearray,r1(f1:chararray,f2:chararray),m1:map[]);

b =  foreach a generate m1#'a' as ms1;
describe b;

store b into 'map1' using org.apache.hadoop.zebra.pig.TableStorer('');


========
So, we should either fix it or document it.
