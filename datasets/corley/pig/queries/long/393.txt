In Pig document, we use {} for data bag and [] for data map. While data bag is more like a collection (a list of other data) and data map is like a hash, their corresponding notation in other language like python (and hash in perl), is actually the other way around. In Python, they use [] for list and {} for map (dictionary). In perl, they use {} for hash, too. The notations in Pig is very confusing for developers who are familiar with Python/perl.
