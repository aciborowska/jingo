Pig tries to determine which fields in a query script file will be needed and passes that information to the load function, thereby optimizing the query by reducing the data to be loaded.

To support this optimization, Zebra needs to implement fieldsToRead method in TableLoader class to utilize this information. This jira is for this new feature.

For more information of this optimization on pig side, one can refer to jira:  PIG-653
