This is from email on pig-dev from Bertrand Delacretaz:

I wrote a blog post [3] while mentoring Wicket, it might help as an overview.

I'd say the minimal set is

1) Check that the required external libraries (if any) can be distributed, see [2]

2) Create the required NOTICE and LICENSE files, see [1] and [2]

3) Generate distribution artifacts which include this info

4) Call for review of these artifacts, followed by a vote here and then a vote by the Incubator PMC.
