I noticed this anti-pattern while reviewing PIG-3142. A lot of LoadFunc implementations in our code base does the following:

public Tuple getNext() throws IOException {
    if (!initialized) {
        // initialize
        initialized = true;
    }
    // load data
}


The LoadFunc interface provides prepareToRead() for any kind of initialization during execution, so we should use it instead. Looking at the commit history, this anti-pattern wasn't cleaned up when the load/store func redesign was merged to trunk:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?limit_changes=0&view=revision&revision=911959

To prevent this anti-pattern from being copied and pasted by new LoadFunc implementations, it would be nice if we could get rid of them in our code base.
