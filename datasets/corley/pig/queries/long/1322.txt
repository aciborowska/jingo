In some cases, we can change the outer join into a regular join. The benefit is regular join is easier to optimize in subsequent optimization. 

Example:
C = join A by a0 LEFT OUTER, B by b0;
D = filter C by b0 > 0;

=> 
C = join A by a0, B by b0;
D = filter C by b0 > 0;

Because we made this change, so PushUpFilter rule can further push the filter in front of regular join which otherwise cannot.
