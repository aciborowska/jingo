Currently, all Spillable DataBags get registered by the BagFactory at the moment of creation. In practice, a lot of these bags will not get large enough to be worth spilling; we can avoid a lot of memory overhead and cheapen the process of finding a bag to spill when we do need it, by allowing Bags themselves to register when they grow to some respectable threshold.
