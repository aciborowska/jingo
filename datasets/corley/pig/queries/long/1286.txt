In Pig 0.7.0 code, we still have the following imports:
import org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Counters;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobClient;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobConf;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobID;

because there is not equivalent mapreduce version of JobClient. When there is one and when we switch, we should make sure this issue with counters in local mode is fixed - For now the code will report these numbers as unknown.
