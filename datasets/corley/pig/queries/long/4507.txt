I am trying to eliminate punctuation and special symbols from a string using REGEX of a type "(w+)". The problem is that this REGEX treatment is applied to the first word of the string only.

Example:
clean3 = FOREACH clean1 GENERATE id, REGEX_EXTRACT_ALL('toto,  likes ... to play ', '(w+)');
It just resturn "toto" instead of "toto likes to play"

Would you guys have any ideas?
