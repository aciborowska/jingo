In the current tez branch, mini cluster unit tests are very slow. The reason is as follows:

	TezSession reuse is by default on.
	Each test case runs, and it waits for Tez AM to terminate.
	After Tez AM times out (usually after several minutes), another test case runs.



Two questions that I have are:

	Why doesn't TezSession reuse work in mini cluster?
	Why is TezSession reuse not disabled in some tests (e.g. TestAccumulator) where we explicitly set "tez.session.reuse" to false?



As for #2, I realized that "tez.session.reuse" was never set in the properties object that is passed to PigServer. I am going to upload a patch that fixes this problem in this jira.

As for #1, I don't have an answer yet. But I think we can fix this in a separate jira once we get Tez unit tests working again.
