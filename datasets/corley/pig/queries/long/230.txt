The following works:

A = load 'studenttab10k';
B = foreach A generate $0, $1, $2;
C = stream B through `perl PigStreaming.pl`;
store C into 'out';

But this one causes an error: Can't open perl script "PigStreaming.pl": No such file or directory.

define CMD `perl PigStreamingDep.pl` input(stdin using PigDump) ship(':SCRIPTHOMEPATH:/PigStreamingDep.pl', ':SCRIPTHOMEPATH:/PigStreamingModule.pm');
A = load 'studenttab10k';
B = stream A through `perl PigStreaming.pl`;
C = stream B through CMD as (name, age, gpa);
D = foreach C generate name, age;
store D into 'out';#,
