There is a pigsmoke artifact created in the pig build, called "pigsmokes".  This artifact has a few tests in it. 


org/apache/pig/test/pigunit/TestPigTest.class
org/apache/pig/test/pigunit/pig/TestGruntParser$1.class
org/apache/pig/test/pigunit/pig/TestGruntParser.class
test/



There is also a "test.smoke.file"  which defines several java classes which run pig tests, which also appear to be smokes:

**/TestCommit.java
**/TestMultiQueryLocal.java
**/TestStreaming.java
**/TestJoinSmoke.java



It would be best if the all the sample pig jobs which were truly "smoke" tests (i.e. tests that can be run on a real pig deployment) could be consolidated somewhere.... because  then various unit tests could pick and run them as necessary... For 3 reasons.

1) It would be easier to manage this artifact for people testing pig functionality in hadoop clusters.

2) It would be easier to test pig in different execution engines (i.e. spark) once those become more common.

3) Right now, its pretty tricky to quickly determine the proper usage of  pigsmoke vs the tests included in test.smoke.file.

This is in context of the tests we run in bigtop for pig. 

In summary: It looks like improvements can be made to the code to consolidate the pig tests which are capable of running on a cluster, versus those which only run as unit tests for the build, so that the artifacts for true "smoke" tests of a running pig system are easy to find, customize, and run, for anyone.
