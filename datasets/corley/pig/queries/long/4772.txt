Hi,
there is probably old description how to build Piggybank jar (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PIG/PiggyBank). The building system ant is archaic also. What about to move to the maven?

The problem is described in the detail at https://community.hortonworks.com/questions/9098/compile-piggybank.html#answer-9137

Could someone investigate the issue?

Thank you
