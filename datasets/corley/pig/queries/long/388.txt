The following scripts fails for a string expression, but works for an arithmetic expression.

log = LOAD 'tutorial/data/excite-small.log' USING PigStorage('\t') as (ip, date, query);

t1 = GROUP log by ip;
describe t1;

counts = FOREACH t1 {
   cnt = COUNT(log);
   GENERATE group as ip, cnt as cnt;
}
describe counts;

r1 = FILTER counts by cnt > 2;
r2 = FILTER counts by ip ne 'BED75271605EBD0C';
describe r1;
describe r2
dump r2;
