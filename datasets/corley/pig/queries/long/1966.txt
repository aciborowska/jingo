If in my script there is a Store and a load from the same location like below;
STORE A INTO '/user/myname/myoutputfolder';
D = LOAD '/user/myname/myoutputfolder/part*' ;

This will cause my script to fail .Pig requires the store and load locations to be exactly same to realize that
there is a dependency .
This behavior of Pig should be documented preferably in
 http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.8.0/piglatin_ref2.html#Load%2FStore+Functions
