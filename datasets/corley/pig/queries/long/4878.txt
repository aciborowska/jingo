PIG-4847 created two issues.

  1) Caused compilation failure with Hadoop 1.x
https://builds.apache.org/job/Pig-trunk-commit/2316/console


  [javac]         double memoryThresholdFraction = conf.getDouble(PigConfiguration.PIG_SPILL_MEMORY_USAGE_THRESHOLD_FRACTION, MEMORY_THRESHOLD_FRACTION_DEFAULT);
    [javac]                                              ^
    [javac]   symbol:   method getDouble(String,double)
    [javac]   location: variable conf of type Configuration



conf.getDouble() is not present in Hadoop 1.x

2) Interchanged use of memory and collection thresholds
