Zebra enables application to stream data into different zebra table instances.

New Interface added:

setMultipleOutputs( JobConf jobconf, String commaSeparatedLocation, Class<? extends ZebraOutputPartitioner> theClass.

Zebra maintains a list of tables instances based on commaseparatedlocations ( in that order )

ZebraOutputPartitioner interface has getOutputPartition method which is implemented by the application. It will return an index into the list. Zebra will write to that instance

We also introduce a new mapred property for setting multiple outputs.

mapred.lib.table.multi.output.dirs
