I discovered this bug while setting up a multi-user cluster. Since the staging dir for Pig jobs is always set to TEZ_AM_STAGING_DIR_DEFAULT (/tmp/tez), if multiple users submit Pig jobs, subsequent jobs fail with the following error:

java.io.IOException: The ownership on the staging directory hdfs://10.170.21.33:9000/tmp/tez/staging is not as expected. It is owned by hadoop. The directory must be owned by the submitter cheolsoop or by cheolsoop
