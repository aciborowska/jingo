A = LOAD 'table1' using org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();
B = filter A by dt == '20150713';
C = filter A by dt == '20150714';
store B into '${output}_1';
store C into '${output}_2';


where 'dt' is a partition field for 'table1', pig would not try to push down the 'dt' filters due to LOSplit blocking it.
