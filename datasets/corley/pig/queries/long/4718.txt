  In both piggybank and builtin AvroStorage, currently DEFAULT_DEFLATE_LEVEL is 1 which is Deflater.BEST_SPEED.  Should switch to Deflater.DEFAULT_COMPRESSION (-1) which is actually 6 and gives a compromise between Deflater.BEST_SPEED (1) and Deflater.BEST_COMPRESSION (9).  Mapreduce's deflate/gzip compression uses DEFAULT_COMPRESSION .
