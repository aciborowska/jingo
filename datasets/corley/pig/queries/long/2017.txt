If a map is read in its serialized form, eg: key#value, then the consumeMap() method of Utf8StorageConverter fails for the following maps:


[a#)]
[a#}]
[a#"take a look at my lovely curly brace, }"]
[a#'oh look, a closed parenthesis! )']



There are a couple of options:

1. Define an escape sequence (ie. quotes or a backslash)
2. Call it a bad record, go get a beer, and move on.
