If you run the "Accumulator" e2e tests, they don't work. It appears that this is because they do not have a "verify_pig_script" portion. This raises the question...

Why hasn't this been surfaced? Which is to say: when and where are the e2e tests run? Are only a subset run? How are errors surfaced?

One fix is to just add a verify_pig_script that mimics the above, but then I'm not sure what it wants to test? Merely that it runs?
