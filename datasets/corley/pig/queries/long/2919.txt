In bin/pig there is a line that says "resolve links - $0 may be a
softlink", yet it does not seem to resolve the link for the script
itself.
I'm not sure what line 71 intends to do, however the attached patch
should allow users to link bin/pig to their preferred PATH directory
and still make pig run as usual.
