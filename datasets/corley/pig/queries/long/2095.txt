bin/pig contains this loop:

141 	# libraries in the lib dir, so don't blindly add them all. Only add the one
142 	# that matche PIG_HADOOP_VERSION.
143 	for f in $PIG_HOME/lib/*.jar; do
144 	IS_HADOOP=`echo $f | grep hadoop`
...
153 	done 

IS_HADOOP is always true if pig is installed in a directory containing the phrase "hadoop", like "/home/hadoop/pig-8.1.0/"
as a consequence, all lib/ jars are dropped from the classpath.
