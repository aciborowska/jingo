See PIG-2614. 

Pig dies when one record in a LOAD of a billion records fails to parse. This is almost certainly not the desired behavior. elephant-bird and some other storage UDFs have minimum thresholds in terms of percent and count that must be exceeded before a job will fail outright.

We need these limits to be configurable for Pig, globally. I've come to realize what a major problem Pig's crashing on bad records is for new Pig users. I believe this feature can greatly improve Pig.

An example of a config would look like:

pig.storage.bad.record.threshold=0.01
pig.storage.bad.record.min=100
