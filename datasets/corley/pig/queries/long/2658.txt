The overall identifier for a pig script pig.script.id added in PIG-1280 ties together the various map-reduce jobs generated for a script.
It would be good to have a timestamp added in the MR job config as well, in order to be able to group one run of a pig script together.

This field in the job conf for each of the generated Hadoop MR jobs would then be the same for one run and represent when the pig script was started.
