The expression  'null == null' evaluates to true, it should get evaluated as null.
ie the filter condition 'fil = filter inp by null == null;' allows all the records through.

It seems to be a problem only with null literal, expressions that evaluate to null don't seem to have a problem.
ie 'nullcol1 == nullcol2' (where nullcol1, nullcol2 are columns with null value), and (1 + null == 1 + null) work correctly .
