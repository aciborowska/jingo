This is to separate additional improvements and original requirement on PIG-129 issue.

Pasting comments of Pi Song. 

"I think the concept of multi-dir temp file creator (LocalDirAllocator in Hadoop) should be adopted to Pig. What it does is:-


	You can set up a set of tmp file dirs in configuration (They can be on different physical drives so you can utilize more disk space)
	When a temp file is being created, the system will probe the given temp dirs in round-robin fashion
	For a selected temp dir, if it exists and you have permission to write, temp file will be created
	For a selected temp dir, it it doesn't exist or you don't have permission to write, the temp dir will be kept in the black list, thus not being used later on.
	For the next temp file, move on to the next temp dir
