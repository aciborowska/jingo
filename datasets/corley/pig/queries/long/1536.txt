We should consider using logic for merging inner schema in case of the two different types of union. 

In case of 'default union', it merges the two inner schema of bags/tuples by position if the number of fields are same and the corresponding types are compatible. 

In case of 'union onschema', it considers tuple/bag with different innerschema to be incompatible types.
