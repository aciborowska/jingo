The following chunk of bin/pig 


# locate ZooKeeper
if [ -d "${PIG_HOME}/share/zookeeper" ]; then
    for f in ${PIG_HOME}/share/zookeeper/zookeeper-*.jar; do
        CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:$f
    done
fi



makes it impossible for pig to pick up ZK installation area
unless the content of the binary tarballs gets massaged in a certain
way.

Would it be possible to have a more generic code in place that
would, perhaps, pay attention to things like ZOOKEEPER_HOME ?
