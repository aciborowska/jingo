Pig Streaming does not set the job conf parameters as environment variables for the streaming binary. This is unlike Hadoop streaming where all the job conf parameters are available as environment variables.

Here is a small test script along with the streaming binary

=== stream.pig ===

A = LOAD 'dat' as (f1:chararray);
DEFINE MY_BIN `./stream.sh` SHIP('./stream.sh');
B = STREAM A THROUGH MY_BIN;
dump B; 

=== stream.sh ===

#!/bin/bash
export
