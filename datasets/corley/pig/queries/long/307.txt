Queries such as:


a = load 'myfile' using PigStorage() as (name, age, gpa);                                                     
b = filter a by name lt 'b';                                                                                                                                    
c = foreach b generate TOKENIZE(name);                                                                                                                          
d = foreach c generate flatten($0);                                                                                                                             
store d into 'outfile';



fail because the flatten statement in d = foreach ... assumes $0 is a bag.
