Currently the following Pig Latin will fail:


A = LOAD '/Users/gates/test/data/studenttab10' as (name, age, gpa);
B = order A by (int)age;
dump B;



with an error message

ERROR 1000: Error during parsing. Encountered " "int" "int "" at line 2, column 17.
Was expecting one of:
    <IDENTIFIER> ...
    <DOLLARVAR> ...



The issue is because Pig expects a column not an expression for Order By.  If the cast is removed, the script passes.  Order by should take an expression for its key, just as group, join, etc. do.
