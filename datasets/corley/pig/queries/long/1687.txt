In interactive mode (grunt shell), the type validation should be done as soon as a line of script is added .
For example -

grunt> l = load 'x' as (a : chararray, b : int);
-- no error when following statement is typed
grunt> f = foreach l generate a + b;   

-- errors only when explain/describe/dump/store is called 
grunt> describe f;

Another example-

grunt> l = load 'x' as (a : chararray, b : int);
grunt> f = foreach l generate CONCAT(a,b);
grunt> describe f;
