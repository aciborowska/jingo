When storing data using AvroStorage(<schema>), its checkSchema() method will still attempt to convert the ResourceSchema passed from Pig into an Avro Schema. It should only attempt to do this when getProperties().getProperty(OUTPUT_AVRO_SCHEMA) is null.

I discovered this when I tried to store a relation with fields that had double colons, calling AvroStorage with a user-defined schema, but I still got the following error:


Pig Schema contains a name that is not allowed in Avro



Using AvroStorage(<schema>, '-d') is a good workaround for now.
