Implementations of PigProcessNotificationListener don't have access to much job-related into until after the job is completed. A few minor edits to PigStatsUtil can change that.


	Expose the JobClient
	Set an initial JobStats object upon kicking off a job. This makes JobId available to clients once it's assigned.
