I would like to offer up some very simple data UDFs I have that wrap JodaTime (apache 2.0 license, http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/license.html) and operate on ISO8601 date strings.
(for piggybank).  Please advise if these are appropriate.

1. Date Arithmetic

takes an input string: 

2009-01-01T13:43:33.000Z
(and partial ones such as 2009-01-02)

and a timespan (as millis or as string shorthand)

returns an ISO8601 string that adjusts the input date by the specified timespan

DatePlus(long timeMs); // + or - number works, is the # of millis
DatePlus(String timespan); //10m = 10 minutes, 1h = 1 hour, 1172 ms, etc
DateMinus(String timespan); //propose explicit minus when using string shorthand for time periods

2. Date Comparison (when you don't have full strings that you can use string compare with):

DateIsBefore(String dateString); //true if lhs is before rhs
DateIsAfter(String dateString); //true if lsh is after rhs

3. date trunc functions:

takes partial ISO8601 strings and truncates to:

toMinute(String dateString);
toHour(String dateString);
toDay(String dateString);
toWeek(String dateString);
toMonth(String dateString);
toYear(String dateString);

if any/all are helpful, I'm happy to contribute to pig
