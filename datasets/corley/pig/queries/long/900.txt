With GROUP BY, you must put parentheses around the aliases in the BY clause:


B = group A by ( a, b, c );



With FILTER BY, you can optionally put parentheses around the aliases in the BY clause:


B = filter A by ( a is not null and b is not null and c is not null );



However, with ORDER BY, if you put parenthesis around the BY clause, you get a syntax error:


 A = order A by ( a, b, c );



Produces the error:


2009-08-03 18:26:29,544 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt -
ERROR 1000: Error during parsing. Encountered " "," ", "" at line 3, column 19.
Was expecting:
    ")" ...



This is an annoyance really.

Here's my full code example ...


A = load 'data.txt' using PigStorage as (a: chararray, b: chararray, c: chararray );

A = order A by ( a, b, c );

dump A;
