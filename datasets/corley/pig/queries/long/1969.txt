Script:

a = load '/user/hadoopqa/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k' as (name:chararray, age, gpa);
b = foreach a generate age + 1, gpa + 0.1f;
describe b;

In 0.8, we see the following warnings:

IMPLICIT_CAST_TO_FLOAT 1 time.)|(Encountered Warning IMPLICIT_CAST_TO_FLOAT 1 time.\n.*Encountered Warning
IMPLICIT_CAST_TO_INT 1 time.*)",

They are missing from 0.9
