  The below query with implicit split will not push down the partition filters and will scan the whole table. 


A  = LOAD 'db1.table1'        USING org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();
B = FILTER A BY ( ((date=='20150501' AND pk2 =='1')) and pk3 == '127' );
C  = FILTER A BY ( ((date=='20150501' AND pk2=='1') OR (date=='20150430' AND pk2=='1')) and pk3 == '127' );



The workaround now is to write two separate LOAD statements for each FILTER. We should do that behind the scenes while planning instead of user having to do that.
