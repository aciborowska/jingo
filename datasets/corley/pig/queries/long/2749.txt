Currently PIG removes any predicate it has pushed down to data sources (via LoadMetaData).  

This JIRA ticket is created to request PIG optimizer to keep all predicates it has pushed down so that:

1) the underlying data sources have more flexibility/opportunities to do projections/indexed lookups. The only requirement for the underlying data sources is that what they return should be be superset of the correct results.

As the result of the new flexibility, the underlying data sources can return more results than the exact predicates pushed down would return (for example using approximate predicate filtering), but still more efficient than full table/file scan.

2) it's easier for programming correction verification since PIG would still apply all predicates.
