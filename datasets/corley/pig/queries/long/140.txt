it would be better if grunt could also remember the pwd after executing a set of complete Pig statements. For instance, if I am at /user/pig/tests/data/myfile/ before issuing any Pig statements, I would expect I am still at the same directory after executing a set of complete Pig statements. The current implementation puts me back to my home directory.
