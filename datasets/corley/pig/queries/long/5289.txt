The file still references hadoop 0.20, zk 3.3.3, etc. We have to fix it sometime to work with newer versions of hadoop and add Tez and Spark. Instead of having a hardcoded file that will go outdated often as versions are incremented would be better to have a ant target that generates the file based on dependencies in build/ivy/lib
