Currently, the automated build process publishes a report that captures the difference in the number of warning messages due to a patch from that of trunk However, the details of the new warning messages are not listed. For findbugs, a url that contains the details is published. A similar page is required for the compiler warning messages.

For reference, check out 

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-697?focusedCommentId=12720326&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12720326

The console output has the following line. Note that the details are stored on the build machine. Its not exported as a web page for users to figure out the details. At least,  I was not able to do so. It would be extremely helpful (I would say mandatory) to expose the details. If these details are already present then please point me to the right location.
