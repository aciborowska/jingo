To reproduce:

ant clean test -Dtestcase=TestCounters -Dhadoopversion=20



This fails with the following error:

Testcase: testMultipleMRJobs took 52.073 sec
    FAILED
expected:<10> but was:<1>
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<10> but was:<1>
    at org.apache.pig.test.TestCounters.testMultipleMRJobs(TestCounters.java:452)



I see the failures with both hadoop-1.0.x and 2-0.x.
