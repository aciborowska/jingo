For failed job PigServer.executeBatch does not return ExecJob . 
ExecJobs are created using output statistics, and the output statistics for jobs that failed does not seem to exist.

The query i tried was a native mapreduce job, where the output file of the native mr job already exists causing that job to fail.

A = load '" + INPUT_FILE + "';
B = mapreduce '" + jarFileName + "' " +
                    "Store A into 'table_testNativeMRJobSimple_input' "+
                    "Load 'table_testNativeMRJobSimple_output' "+
            "`WordCount table_testNativeMRJobSimple_input " + INPUT_FILE + "`;");
Store B into 'table_testNativeMRJobSimpleDir';);
