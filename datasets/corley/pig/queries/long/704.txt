I'm using the interactive mode to test my scripts, and I'm struggling to keep track of 2 things:

1) the aliases. A typical test script has 10 aliases or more. As the test goes on, different versions are created, or aliases are created with typos. There's no command in grunt to get the list of defined aliases. Proposed solution: add a new command "aliases" that prints the list of aliases.

2) I prefer to give meaningful (long) names to my aliases. But as I try different things, I find it hard to predict what the schema will look like, so I use DESCRIBE a lot. It's a pain to type these long names all the time, especially since most of the time I only want to describe the last alias created. A shortcut to the describe command describing the last alias will be very useful. Proposed solution: use the special name "_" as a shortcut to the last created alias: DECRIBE _.
