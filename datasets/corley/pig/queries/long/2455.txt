There seems to be no API in Apache Pig that provides back a version string, or anything of that sort. For Apache Hadoop and HBase, we have VersionInfo classes doing this.

I'm up for providing a patch if you guys feel this is worth maintaining (you'd need to maintain a package-info.java with some strings, as you change versions/revisions, I can look at how hadoop maintains this and help).

I came across this thought while trying to think of an easy way around OOZIE-623.
