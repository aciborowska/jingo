Pig unit tests have a lot of diverse patterns for temporary file allocation.  Not all of them are best practices.  There is an abstraction that could house best practices for test temporary file allocation â€“ FileLocalizer.getTemporaryPath.  With this, we should be able to have all/most of the temporary file usage fall under just a few methods that can handle arbitrary pig contexts and provide more flexibility around testing pig with different fs implementations.
