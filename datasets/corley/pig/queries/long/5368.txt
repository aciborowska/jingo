 



In perl v5.22, using a literal { in a regular expression was deprecated, and will emit a warning if it isn't escaped: {. In v5.26, this won't just warn, it'll cause a syntax error.





Example: https://github.com/apache/pig/blob/e766b6bf29e610b6312f8447fc008bed6beb4090/test/e2e/pig/tests/cmdline.conf#L47  



$ perl -e 'print "It matches\n" if "Hello World" =~ /World{abc}/'
Unescaped left brace in regex is illegal here in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/World\{ <-- HERE abc}/ at -e line 1.

$ perl -e 'print "It matches\n" if "Hello World" =~ /World\{abc}/'
