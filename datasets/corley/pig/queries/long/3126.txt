A = Load 'sample';
store A into '/user/xyz/sample-out';

When this pig script is run using abc user who does not have write permission in '/user/xyz', PIG is unable to create the directory sample-out and the map-reduce job gets killed ultimately without any log. PIG should throw some error log saying permission denied.
