  PigSecondaryKeyComparator does not implement a compare(WritableComparable a, WritableComparable b) method. In case of  OrderedGroupedMergedKVInput with vertex groups, object comparison instead of byte comparison is done when merging the multiple inputs into one. Since the compare API is not overridden, WritableComparator compare API is called and  the value types are directly compared which means it is always ascending.
