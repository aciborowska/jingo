Sine the SpillableMemoryManager subscribed the memory notifications, and hold a weak reference of all the spillable, if there's too many weak reference and the memory exceeds the threshold, the current code will not clear the spillable weak references.

the details is illustrated in the attached screenshot of a MemoryAnalyzer.
So we need to clear the spillables when the memory notifications is received.
