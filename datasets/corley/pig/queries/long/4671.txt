Hi Team,
With respect to the feature development here 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-506

I tried the above approach, but PIG forces to store the data in one directory and then load the data from this directory. 
Eg :
A = Load ....
B = MAPREDUCE 'SomeJar.jar' Store A into input Load Output as ...

Here we are loading and simply storing it back again for the Map-reduce Job To work.

I do not think this is Optimized way because, suppose, I have implemented my Own Pig-Readers which is smart, and now I want to load Data Using this Pig-Reader into my Mapreduce job, then It will load using this reader and then Store it in some Directory from where the MR will take it as Input. (Lot of Unnecessary IO where I could directly fed the data From my Custom Pig Loader to my MapReduce Job) 

Can There be a way where the data loaded by A can be directly Fed to the Map-reduce Job.???!!!

That is, If required, We shall Implement some Readers Of Pig In our MR jobs and then Use it to Read Data into MR.
We have implemented some Smart Pig Readers , I want to use them in my map reduce and not use the native MR readers.

Please have a look at this case scenario.
