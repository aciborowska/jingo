Implement TezCompiler that compiles physical plan into tez plan. To begin with, we can implement the initial version that works for basic queries as follows:

	Load-Filter-Store

a = load 'file:///tmp/input' as (x:int, y:int);
b = filter a by x > 0;
c = foreach b generate y;
store c into 'file:///tmp/output';


	Load-Filter-GroupBy-Store

a = load 'file:///tmp/input' as (x:int, y:int);
b = group a by x;
c = foreach b generate group, a;
store c into 'file:///tmp/output';


	Load1-Load2-Join-Store

a = load 'file:///tmp/input1' as (x:int, y:int);
b = load 'file:///tmp/input2' as (x:int, z:int);
c = join a by x, b by x;
d = foreach c generate a::x as x, y, z;
store d into 'file:///tmp/output';
