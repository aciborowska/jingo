Using the trunk version of Pig, I had to do much more than listed on https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PIG/How+to+set+up+Eclipse+environment to get Pig setup and working in Eclipse. I had to do the following:


	Make sure I'm using Java 7.
	ant clean eclipse-files -Dhadoopversion=23
	ant compile gen -Dhadoopversion=23
	In Eclipse, File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> Browse to Pig repo -> Finish.
	Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Source -> Add Folder test/perf/pigmix/src/java.
	Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Remove javacc-4.2.jar.
	Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Add JAR test/perf/pigmix/lib/sdsuLibJKD12.jar.
	Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Add External JAR hadoop-yarn-server-applicationhistoryservice-*.jar. (I had to find and download this jar myself. It is needed for running tests.)



Finally, I was able to build the project without errors and run the tests using JUnit from within Eclipse.

It would be nice to fix/automate some of these steps.
