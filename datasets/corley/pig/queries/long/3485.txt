PIG-1876 added typed map and annotated the following method as deprecated in 0.9:

@Deprecated
public Map<String, Object> bytesToMap(byte[] b) throws IOException;


We should remove and replace it with the new method that takes type information:

public Map<String, Object> bytesToMap(byte[] b, ResourceFieldSchema fieldSchema) throws IOException;
