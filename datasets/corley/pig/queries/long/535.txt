currently there is no way to ignore if a file isn't present when you try to remove it.

this can be painful if you restart jobs halfway because of failure.

"rmf" will ignore files that don't exist, similar to how rm -f works.

my java-parser foo is even weaker than my java skills, so there may be a better way of implementing this
