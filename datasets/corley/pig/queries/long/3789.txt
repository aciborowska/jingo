Similar to the comments in POSimpleTezLoad:

    /**
     * Previously, we reused the same Result object for all results, but we found
     * certain operators (e.g. POStream) save references to the Result object and
     * expect it to be constant.
     */


Tuples put into binaryInputQueue get changed when it is actually processed. Not exactly sure why, but make a copy of the tuple solves the issue.
