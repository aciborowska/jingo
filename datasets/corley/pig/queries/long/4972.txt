Saw StreamingIO_1 on particular perl version due to a warning in PigStreaming.pl. You can see the warning in any version of perl using "perl -w":

defined(%hash) is deprecated at streaming/PigStreaming.pl line 76.
	(Maybe you should just omit the defined()?)



In some particular version of perl, warning check is mandatory and the perl script just fail.
