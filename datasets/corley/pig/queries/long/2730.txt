TFileStorage.java throws an exception in getStatistics:


@Override
public ResourceStatistics getStatistics(String location, Job job) throws IOException {
  throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}



However the interface for LoadMetadata.java states null should be returned if statistics are not available:


/**
 * Get statistics about the data to be loaded.  If no statistics are
 * available, then null should be returned. If the implementing class also extends
 * {@link LoadFunc}, then {@link LoadFunc#setLocation(String, org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Job)}
 * is guaranteed to be called before this method.
 * @param location Location as returned by 
 * {@link LoadFunc#relativeToAbsolutePath(String, org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path)}
 * @param job The {@link Job} object - this should be used only to obtain 
 * cluster properties through {@link Job#getConfiguration()} and not to set/query
 * any runtime job information.  
 * @return statistics about the data to be loaded.  If no statistics are
 * available, then null should be returned.
 * @throws IOException if an exception occurs while retrieving statistics
 */
ResourceStatistics getStatistics(String location, Job job) 
throws IOException;
