Pig supports a dot graph style plan to visualize the logical/physical/mapreduce plan (explain with -dot option, see http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449302641/developing_and_testing.html). However, dot graph takes extra step to generate the plan graph and the quality of the output is not good. It's better we can implement a better visualizer for Pig. It should:
1. show operator type and alias
2. turn on/off output schema
3. dive into foreach inner plan on demand
4. provide a way to show operator source code, eg, tooltip of an operator (plan don't currently have this information, but you can assume this is in place)
5. besides visualize logical/physical/mapreduce plan, visualize the script itself is also useful
6. may rely on some java graphic library such as Swing

This is a candidate project for Google summer of code 2013. More information about the program can be found at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PIG/GSoc2013
