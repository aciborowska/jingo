When I try to call XPath UDF to process a very simple XML with Pig 0.12 I get the problem:
2014-01-13 16:14:19,530 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1045: 
<line 3, column 25> Could not infer the matching function for org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.xml.XPath as multiple or none of them fit. Please use an explicit cast. I guess the XPath UDF overrides the getArgToFuncMapping() in an incorrect way. A fixed is attached.
