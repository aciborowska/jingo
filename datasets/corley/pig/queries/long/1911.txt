Sample script:

register v_udf.jar;
a = load '2records' as (f1:chararray,f2:chararray);
b = group a by f1;
d = foreach b 
{ sort = order a by f1; 
  generate org.udfs.MyCOUNT(sort) as something ; }
dump d;

This causes infinite loop if MyCOUNT implements Accumulator interface.

The workaround is to take the function out of nested foreach into a separate foreach statement.
