Consider a Pig script which does something similar to a word count. It uses the built-in TOKENIZE function, but packages it inside a class hierarchy such as "mypackage.eval"

register TOKENIZE.jar
my_src  = LOAD '/user/viraj/mywordcount.txt' USING PigStorage('\t')  AS (mlist: chararray);
modules = FOREACH my_src GENERATE FLATTEN(mypackage.eval.TOKENIZE(mlist));
describe modules;
grouped = GROUP modules BY $0;
describe grouped;
counts  = FOREACH grouped GENERATE COUNT(modules), group;
ordered = ORDER counts BY $0;
dump ordered;



The parser complains:
===========================================================================================================================
2009-02-05 01:17:29,231 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1000: Error during parsing. Invalid alias: mypackage in

I looked at the following source code at (src/org/apache/pig/impl/logicalLayer/parser/QueryParser.jjt) and it seems that : EVAL is a keyword in Pig. Here are some clarifications:

1) Is there documentation on what the EVAL keyword actually is?
2) Is EVAL keyword actually implemented?
