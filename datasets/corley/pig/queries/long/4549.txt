Spark engine should set parallelism to be used for CROSS operation by GFCross UDF.

If not set, GFCross throws an exception:

                String s = cfg.get(PigImplConstants.PIG_CROSS_PARALLELISM + "." + crossKey);
                if (s == null) {
                    throw new IOException("Unable to get parallelism hint from job conf");
                }



Estimating parallelism for Spark engine is a TBD item. Until that is done, for CROSS to work, we should use the default parallelism value in GFCross.
