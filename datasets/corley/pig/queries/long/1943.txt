if you have pig udf functions in a pig script, and want to re-use it (i.g. import from another script) the decorators must be defined. They will not be, due to scoping rules, so the decorators should be available via a standard importable module that ships with the jython framework (as we already define the decorators as part of initializing the interpreter).

this simply involves adding an appropriately named: pigdecorators.py to the classpath, so a dev can do:


from pigdecorators import *
@outputSchema("w:chararray")
def word():
 return 'word'

this can be done currently in the primary script, but when https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-1824 is completed, that script would not properly import when used within another script in the future.
