This is a regression of PIG-3795. In TezCompiler, visitDistinct() doesn't set the requested parallelism of TezOperator, resulting that only one reducer runs for the following query-

A = LOAD 'table_testCustomPartitionerDistinct' as (a0:int, a1:int);
B = distinct A PARTITION BY org.apache.pig.test.utils.SimpleCustomPartitioner3 parallel 2;



The test fails because it sees a single output file while it expects two.
