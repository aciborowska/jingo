Currently, BinStorage breaks the rule that unless it tells Pig what types it is producing it should produce bytearrays. This causes runtime problems as the frontend assumes the data to be of one type while in fact it is of different type.

Loader interface has a way to specify schema via determineSchema API. BinStorage need to implement this. Also, since this interface has not been used before, the pluming might also need to be adjusted.
