Currently we are doing this wrong:


if [ "$PIG_CLASSPATH" != "" ]; then
    CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:${PIG_CLASSPATH}



This means that anything added to CLASSPATH until that point will never be able to get overridden by a user set environment, which is wrong behavior. Hadoop libs for example are added to CLASSPATH, before this extension is called in bin/pig.
