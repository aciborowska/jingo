I want to generate data with bags, so I did this,

take a simple text file b.txt

100          apple
200          orange
300          pear
400          apple

then run query:

a = load 'b.txt' as (id, f);
b = group a by id;
store b into 'g' using BinStorage();

then run another query to load data generated from previous step.

a = load 'g/part*' using BinStorage() as (id, d:bag
{t:(v, s)}
);
b = foreach a generate (double)id, flatten(d);
dump b;

then I got the following result:

(,100,apple)
(,100,apple)
(,200,orange)
(,200,apple)
(,300,strawberry)
(,300,pear)
(,400,pear)

the value for id is gone.  If there is no cast, then the result is correct.
