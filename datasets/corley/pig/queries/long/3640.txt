PIG-3117 make it configurable whether to keep intermediate files between MR jobs during the execution. So if we run queries in Grunt shell, we can keep intermediate files.

However, intermediate files are still deleted when Pig exits. It would be nice if we could retain intermediate files even in batch mode for debugging purpose.
