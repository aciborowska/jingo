Currently RandomSampleLoader calls skip() on the underlying input stream (BufferedPositionedInputStream) in its getNext(). The input stream may not actually skip over the amount the RandomSampleLoader needs in one call. RandomSampleLoader should check the return value from the skip() call and ensure that skip() is called repeatedly (if necessary) till the needed number of bytes are skipped.
