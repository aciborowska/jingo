A = load '/tmp/data' using PigStorage() as (a1, a2, a3);
B = foreach A generate a1,a2,a3;\n"

generates the plan as

-B: New For Each(false,false,false)[bag] - scope-45



 


   Project[bytearray][0] - scope-39


 


   Project[bytearray][1] - scope-41


 


   Project[bytearray][2] - scope-43




--A: Load(/tmp/data:PigStorage()) - scope-38---





It would be good to change the plan generated to combine all these and fetch all projected columns at once instead of looping and projecting one by one. POUserFunc, POCast, etc in the Foreach cannot be combined and will have to be separate.
