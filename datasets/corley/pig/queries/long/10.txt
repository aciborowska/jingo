Currently, in intermediate results, the data is written with a marker for every column in every row.  For instance if
we are writing a row that has a schema of bag, atom, we'll write:

BAGMARKER BAGDATA ATOMMARKER ATOMDATA


There's no reason to write the markers for every row.  Is should be sufficient to write it once at the beginning of the
file and then remember it for subsequent rows.
