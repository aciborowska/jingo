I installed pig in /usr/local/pig and made a symlink of /usr/local/pig/bin/pig to /usr/local/bin/pig

When attempting to run pig  I got the error "Cannot locate pig.jar. do 'ant jar', and try again". I tracked the error to be that PIG_HOME was not set correctly. The code that does that uses pwd -P which only works when the symlink is part of the directory structure.

Proposed fix:
$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$this")")
