This is a code style/quality improvement.

isAssignableFrom is appropriate when the class is not known at compile type, but assignment needs to be checked.
e.g. foo.getClass().isAssignableFrom(bar.getClass())

but, if the class of foo is known (e.g. X.class), then instanceof is more appropriate and readable.
i also made use of de morgan's to simply the "is combininable" boolean statement, which is hard to grok as written.
