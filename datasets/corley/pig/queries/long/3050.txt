There was a race condition reported when running Pig in local mode on the user mailing list. This motivated me to fix potential multithreading bugs that can be identified by FindBugs.

FindBugs identifies the following potential bugs:

	Mutable static field
	Inconsistent synchronization
	Incorrect lazy initialization of static field
	Incorrect lazy initialization and update of static field
	Unsynchronized get method, synchronized set method



There are in total 1153 warnings that FindBugs complains, but they're outside of the scope of this jira.
