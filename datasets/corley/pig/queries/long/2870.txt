Jobs that have valid input data, but 0 input splits (this is the case where indexing implemented in the InputFormat might return 0 splits for an aggressive filter) fail when pigServer.openIterator is called. This is because mapred.output.dir isn't set, so the job succeeds without creating the empty output directory. The ReadToEndLoader then fails due to the null input directory.

It seems PIG-2578 introduced this issue.
