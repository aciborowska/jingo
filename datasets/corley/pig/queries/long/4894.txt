Currently this is done with config settings. Having a programmatic API will let people writing StoreFunc to specifically state whether they support it or not.  Added the method to StoreFunc instead of creating a new interface. If it is a new interface, then the StoreFunc implementation cannot be used with older versions of Pig.

When we drop JDK 7 support (hopefully in another year), will move this as a default method to StoreFuncInterface as JDK 8 supports that.
