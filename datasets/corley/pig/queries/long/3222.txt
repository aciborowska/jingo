Pig 0.11 assigns different UDFContextSignature for different invocations of the same load/store statement. This change breaks the HCatStorer which assumes all front-end and back-end invocations of the same store statement has the same UDFContextSignature so that it can read the previously stored information correctly.

The related HCatalog code is in https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/hcatalog/branches/branch-0.5/hcatalog-pig-adapter/src/main/java/org/apache/hcatalog/pig/HCatStorer.java (the setStoreLocation() function).
