There are various errors in pig's grammar files highlighted by ANTLRWorks.
In particular, on token MATCHES, ANY and EVAL.
The first one should be removed, as there is already STR_OP_MATCHES,
the second one is an imaginary tokens that should be defined in the appropriate section.
On the third one I am not sure.
I have been told it is from the old parsers but it is not used anywhere. Is it correct?
Is it reserved for future uses? Has it anything to do with FUNC_EVAL?
