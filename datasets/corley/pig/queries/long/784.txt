I want an option to PigStorage() for LOAD which will allow me to turn off the "Attempt to access field" warnings.

Something like:


define PigStorage PigStorage("warn_load_nonexistent_field=off");

A = load 'mydata.txt' using PigStorage()
        as (col1: chararray, col2_optional: int, col3_optional: float);



or


A = load 'mydata.txt' using PigStorage("warn_load_nonexistent_field=0")
        as (col1: chararray, col2_optional: int, col3_optional: float);



If I have a very large data set with optional columns that are not populated (and have no tab separator), I'd like to just read the file as is and not generate the warnings.

The warnings are problematic because the fill up the logging output and every System.out.println will generate slow down the overall processing.  Especially if the data file being processed is missing one or more columns on every single row.
