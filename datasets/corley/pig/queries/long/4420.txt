   Our CROSS implementation is very costly.  Recently had a case where a user was doing a CROSS of 30million records against 3K records and it caused lot of disk error exceptions during the shuffle phase. We need to add support for a map side cross syntax

C = CROSS A, B using 'replicate';

The smaller table can be loaded in a list (hashmap in replicate join) and iterated through for each record in the bigger table. It should give a major performance boost and drastically reduce the resource usage.
