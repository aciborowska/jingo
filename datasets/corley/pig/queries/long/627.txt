Currently, if your Pig script contains multiple stores and some shared computation, Pig will execute several independent queries. For instance:

A = load 'data' as (a, b, c);
B = filter A by a > 5;
store B into 'output1';
C = group B by b;
store C into 'output2';

This script will result in map-only job that generated output1 followed by a map-reduce job that generated output2. As the resuld data is read, parsed and filetered twice which is unnecessary and costly.
