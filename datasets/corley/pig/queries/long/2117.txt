This is more readable -
res = FOREACH gby GENERATE group, FUNC(DISTINCT in.c3);
than 
res = FOREACH gby 
{ dist_c3 = DISTINCT in.c3; GENERATE group, FUNC(dist_c3);}

All relations supported within nested-foreach could be supported for use within expressions.
other examples -
res = FOREACH gby GENERATE group, FUNC(limit in.c3 10);
