These conversions can be performing better. If the input is not numeric (1234abcd) the code calls Double.valueOf(String) regardless before finally returning null. Any script that inadvertently (user's mistake or not) tries to cast non-numeric column to int or long would result in many wasteful calls. 

We can avoid this and only handle the cases we find the input to be a decimal number (1234.56) and return null otherwise even before trying Double.valueOf(String).
