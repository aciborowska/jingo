I have a udf that generates different outputs when running as jython and streaming python.
jython
{([[BBC Worldwide]])}

 
streaming python
{(BC Worldwid)}


The problem is that streaming python encodes a bag output incorrectly. For this particular example, it serializes the output string as follows-

|{_[[BBC Worldwide]]|}_


where '|' and '_' wrap bag delimiters '{' and '}'. i.e. '{' => '|{_' and '}' => '|}_'.

But this is wrong because bag must contain tuples not chararrays. i.e. the correct encoding is as follows-

|{_|(_[[BBC Worldwide]]|)_|}_


where '|' and '_' wrap tuple delimiters '(' and ')' as well as bag delimiters.

This results in truncated outputs.
