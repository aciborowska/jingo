Joins can fail with an out-of-bounds access to fields that are not referenced in the script when records without schema (including all variable-length records) are involved.
Example by Ben Reed:
i1:
1       c       D       E
1       a       B

i2:
0
0       Q
1       x       z
1       a       b       c


i1 = load 'i1';                                                                                                                                                                        
i2 = load 'i2';                                                                                                                                                                        
j = join i1 by $0, i2 by $0;
