SedesHelper.writeChararray does writeUTF, but we do str1 = new String(bb1.array(), bb1.position(), casz1, BinInterSedes.UTF8); when reading it in the BinInterSedesTupleRawComparator https://github.com/apache/pig/blob/e0c5f265c68491395d8303c86195445be3d8aecf/src/org/apache/pig/data/BinInterSedes.java#L959-L964. For some reason, this works fine in my MAC (both jdk7 and jdk8) but not in Linux. Not sure about the actual cause and have not dug into it. Suspecting either charset environment or the specific update of jdk 8 (different in my MAC and Linux).
