With this patch I'd like to add the possibility to directly read data from HDFS instead of launching MR jobs in case of simple (map-only) tasks. Hive already has this feature (fetch). This patch shares some similarities with the local mode of Pig 0.6. Here, fetching kicks off when the following holds for a script:


	it contains only LIMIT, FILTER, UNION (if no split is generated), STREAM, (nested) FOREACH with expression operators, custom UDFs..etc
	no scalar aliases
	no SampleLoader
	single leaf job
	DUMP (no STORE)



The feature is enabled by default and can be toggled with:

	-N or -no_fetch
	set opt.fetch true/false;



There's no STORE support because I wanted to make it explicit that this "optimization" is for launching small/simple scripts during development, rather than querying and filtering large number of rows on the client machine. However, a threshold could be given on the input size (an estimation) to determine whether to prefer fetch over MR jobs, similar to what Hive's 'hive.fetch.task.conversion.threshold' does. (through Pig's LoadMetadata#getStatistic ?)
