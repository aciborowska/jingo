If nested foreach plan contains sort/distinct, it is possible to use hadoop secondary sort instead of SortedDataBag and DistinctDataBag to optimize the query. 

Eg1:
A = load 'mydata';
B = group A by $0;
C = foreach B {
    D = order A by $1;
    generate group, D;
}
store C into 'myresult';

We can specify a secondary sort on A.$1, and drop "order A by $1".

Eg2:
A = load 'mydata';
B = group A by $0;
C = foreach B {
    D = A.$1;
    E = distinct D;
    generate group, E;
}
store C into 'myresult';

We can specify a secondary sort key on A.$1, and simplify "D=A.$1; E=distinct D" to a special version of distinct, which does not do the sorting.
