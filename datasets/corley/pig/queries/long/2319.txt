Utils.tmpFileCompressionCodec() hard-codes support for only "gz" and "lzo" compression.  Since support for snappy was added in HADOOP-7206, it would be nice to allow this codec as well.

A future-proof solution to this problem might let the user provide a full classname (like in the hadoop settings) or the short-hand, in case the short-hand doesn't exist for a given codec.
