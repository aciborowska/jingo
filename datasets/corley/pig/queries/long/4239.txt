If "pig.output.lazy" is "true", empty part files from the output will be omitted.
steps to reproduce
1. set "pig.output.lazy" as “true" in $PIG_HOME/conf/pig.properties.
2. run following lazy.pig script in spark mode:
cat lazy.pig
a = load '/user/pig/lazy' using PigStorage();
b = filter a by $0  == 'hey';
c = store b into '/tmp/lazy.out';
lazy.pig and lazy are attached
3.  empty file "/tmp/lazy.out/part-rxxxx” is still generated, the empty file is expected not to be generated when "pig.output.lazy" is "true"
