This is a regression of PIG-3573.

In ivy/libraries.properties, the version of jline is specified as 0.9.94-

jline.version=0.9.94


But since jline is also a dependency of accumulo, jline-1.0.jar is pulled down at compile time-

$ ls build/ivy/lib/Pig/jline-*
build/ivy/lib/Pig/jline-1.0.jar



Now when pig-withouthadoop.jar is built, jline-1.0.jar is not packaged because ant looks for jline-0.9.94.jar-

<include name="jline-${jline.version}.jar"/>



This causes a ClassNotFount exception at runtime.
