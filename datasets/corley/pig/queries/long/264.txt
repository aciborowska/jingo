Main uses value of 0 or 1 in rc variable to indicate success or failure of the program. It does not seemed to be consistently set for both success and faulire situations. As the result, the return code is not very useful in determining whether the program succeeded or failed.

Main.java needs to be examined and cleaned up to resolve this issue.
