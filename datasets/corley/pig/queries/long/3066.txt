This is a regression from PIG-2924. The size of output in PigStats used to be off by 1 byte per store, but that was fixed by PIG-2924. However, two test cases in TestPigRunner wasn't corrected, so they fail in trunk.

The reason why the size of output in PigStats were off by 1 byte per store is because the size variable was initialized by -1 instead of 0.

long bytes = -1;
...
bytes += status.getLen();
