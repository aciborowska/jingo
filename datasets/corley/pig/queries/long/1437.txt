Its possible to rewrite queries like this

A = load 'data' as (name,age);
B = group A by (name,age);
C = foreach B generate group.name, group.age;
dump C;


or

 
(name,age);
B = group A by (name
A = load 'data' as,age);
C = foreach B generate flatten(group);
dump C;



to

A = load 'data' as (name,age);
B = distinct A;
dump B;



This could only be done if no columns within the bags are referenced subsequently in the script. Since in Pig-Hadoop world DISTINCT will be executed more effeciently then group-by this will be a huge win.
