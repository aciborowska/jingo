I'm using the 0.9.1 official release.

My input data are read form a text file 'activity' (provided as attachment):


00,1239698069000, <- this is the line that is not correctly handled
01,1239698505000,b
01,1239698369000,a
02,1239698413000,b
02,1239698553000,c
02,1239698313000,a
03,1239698316000,a
03,1239698516000,c
03,1239698416000,b
03,1239698621000,d
04,1239698417000,c



My script is working correctly:


-- load input data
activities = LOAD 'activity' USING PigStorage(',') AS (sid:chararray, timestamp:long, name:chararray);

-- group input data
activities = GROUP activities BY sid;
activities = FOREACH activities GENERATE group, activities.(timestamp, name);

-- store grouped activities in a temporary file
STORE activities INTO 'tmp' USING PigStorage();

-- reload grouped activities from the temporary file
activities = LOAD 'tmp' USING PigStorage() AS (sid:chararray, acts:bag { act:tuple (timestamp:long, name:chararray) });

-- store grouped activities again in an output file
STORE activities INTO 'output' USING PigStorage();



After running this script, the 'output' file contains a correct result:


00	{(1239698069000,)}
01	{(1239698505000,b),(1239698369000,a)}
02	{(1239698413000,b),(1239698553000,c),(1239698313000,a)}
03	{(1239698316000,a),(1239698516000,c),(1239698416000,b),(1239698621000,d)}
04	{(1239698417000,c)}



But the issue occurs when I use BinStorage() instead of PigStorage() to store / reload my temporary files. The 'output' file in that case is not complete:


00	
01	{(1239698505000,b),(1239698369000,a)}
02	{(1239698413000,b),(1239698553000,c),(1239698313000,a)}
03	{(1239698316000,a),(1239698516000,c),(1239698416000,b),(1239698621000,d)}
04	{(1239698417000,c)}



The not working script is the following:


-- load input data
activities = LOAD 'activity' USING PigStorage(',') AS (sid:chararray, timestamp:long, name:chararray);

-- group input data
activities = GROUP activities BY sid;
activities = FOREACH activities GENERATE group, activities.(timestamp, name);

-- store grouped activities in a temporary file
STORE activities INTO 'tmp' USING PigStorage();

-- reload grouped activities from the temporary file
activities = LOAD 'tmp' USING PigStorage() AS (sid:chararray, acts:bag { act:tuple (timestamp:long, name:chararray) });

-- store grouped activities again in an output file
STORE activities INTO 'output' USING PigStorage();



So the issue seems to be located in the way the BinStorage() store or load bags.
