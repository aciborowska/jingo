Error in documentation on web related to python udf usage:
The document mentions JYTHON_PATH but it should be JYTHONPATH. Seasoned jython users will easily figure this out but for cpython users who are new to jython, 
this error can easily be a show stopper.

I observed this in 11.0 but it may be occuring in earlier versions.

Importing Modules
You can import Python modules in your Python script. Pig resolves Python dependencies recursively, which means Pig will automatically ship all dependent Python modules to the backend. Python modules should be found in the jython search path: JYTHON_HOME, JYTHON_PATH, or current directory.
