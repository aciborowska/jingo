If a field in the output relation (which you are trying to dump) is a map whose values are maps, dump does not display the inner map in the value in the key#value format. It appears that the toString() of HashMap is being called which displays the inner map as 
{key1 = value1, key2 = value2...}
 - this needs to change to key1#value,key2#vaule2...
