Currently PigStorage does not write any values to a file when a null data point is encountered.  For example:
Input from a Hive table: a,NULL,c,d
Output using PigStorage: a,,c,d

Having a configurable PigStorage null value to write to a file would save one from having to do a filter to replace null values inside the script.
