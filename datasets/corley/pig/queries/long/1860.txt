Using the same inputs as in PIG-1858, 


register myanotherudf.jar;
A = load 'myinput' using PigStorage() as ( date:chararray,bcookie:chararray,count:int,avg:double,pvs:int);
B = foreach A generate (int)(avg / 100.0) * 100   as avg, pvs;
C = group B by ( avg );
D = foreach C {
        Pvs = order B by pvs;
        Const = org.vivek.MyAnotherUDF(Pvs.pvs).(count,sum);
        generate Const.sum as sum;
        };
store D into 'out_D';



In this script even though I am passing Pvs.pvs to the UDF in the nested foreach, at runtime the "avg" is getting passed.
It looks like the logical plan created for D is wrong.
