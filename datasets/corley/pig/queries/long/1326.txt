We do not have unique sort in Pig Latin. If user want to do a unique sort, they have to do a distinct followed by a sort. This is two map-reduce jobs. However, we can identify some patterns in the script. If the user intend to do a unique sort, we can merge two map-reduce jobs into one. This rule need physical layer support to deal with unique sort.

Example:
B = distinct A;
C = sort B by *;

=> C = uniq sort A by *;
