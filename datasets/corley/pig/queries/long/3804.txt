The LimitOptimizer cases don't seem right (Starting at line 142 in file src/org/apache/pig/newplan/logical/rules/LimitOptimizer.java). It looks like one optimization was added wrongly and one extra bracket had to be added at the end. There's a TODO note but it looks like some parts weren't commented properly.
