I work with a data set that uses random longs (64 bit integers) as identifiers.  Recently I've been accessing the data from Pig and using JsonStorage to save records, that I then run through another script to get JSON that I can feed into other tools.  One of the tools I use is broken in the sense that it treats all numbers as 64 bit floating point, and it can't faithfully reproduce most of the identifiers I pass it.  My work around is to convert the identifiers to strings before they get to that tool.  

If I provide a patch, is there interest in adding an option to JsonStorage that tells it to serialize all longs as if they are strings?
