    [junit] 	Caused an ERROR
    [junit] Java heap space
    [junit] java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
    [junit] 



Proposed patch, add this to the junit tag:

<jvmarg value="-Xmx512m  -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"/>

or

<jvmarg value="-Xmx512m"/>
<jvmarg value="-XX:PermSize=128m"/>
<jvmarg value="-XX:MaxPermSize=512m"/>


not sure which one is correct, I need to check...

See JUnit task for more details

An even better solution is to check why there is a OutOfMemoryError in the first place.
May be it's a sign somethings'wrong or consuming too much memory...
