Modifications to Pig E2E harness and tests for cross compatibility with Windows.

*Remove fully qualified path from tools (perl, cat, etc.)
*Change quoting and escaping of commands for cross compatibility. 
*Explicitly execute perl scripts with perl as Windows doesn't support shebang(#!)
*Use perl APIs in place of incompatible commands (mkdir -p to make_path)
