The code in doHod in backend/hadoop/executionengine/HExecutionEngine.java waits for hod connection to be fully established before setting a flag that indicates need to discunnect. The flag should be set as soon as HOD process is created so that we destroy it. 

This change will not guarantee that process is not left behind but would make it much less likely
