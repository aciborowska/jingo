The exec() call to Algebraic UDF initial and intermediate classes are required to return a Tuple. This has been done because the output is collected in a DataBag and passed to Intermediate.exec() and Final.exec() calls, and DataBag in pig needs to contain a Tuple. But this results in additional Tuple objects getting created and also adds additional (de)serialization costs. Functions such as COUNT, SUM are also having to wrap the initial and intermediate results in Tuples.

The Algebraic interface needs to change to reduce the costs for udfs that don't need an intermediate tuple .
