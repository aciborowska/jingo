The goal of this task is to make map/reduce test cases run on real cluster.

Currently map/reduce test cases are mostly tested under local mode. When running on real cluster, all involved jars have to be manually deployed in advance which is not desired. 

The major change here is to support -libjars option to be able to ship user jars to backend automatically.
