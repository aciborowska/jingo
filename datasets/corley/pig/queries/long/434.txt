Here are the truth tables for AND and OR - currently we do not short circuit and return a null if either operand is null (for both AND and OR)



        truth table for AND 
        t = true, n = null, f = false
        AND  t n f
              t    t n f
             n   n n f
             f    f f f


        truth table for OR 
        t = true, n = null, f = false
        OR   t n f
             t    t t t
            n    t n n
            f     t n f
