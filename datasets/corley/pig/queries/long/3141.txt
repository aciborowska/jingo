Adds an argument to CSVExcelStorage to skip the header row when loading. This works properly with multiple small files each with a header being combined into one split, or a large file with a single header being split into multiple splits.

Also fixes a few bugs with CSVExcelStorage, including PIG-2470 and a bug involving quoted fields at the end of a line not escaping properly.
