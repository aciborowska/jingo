union and cross operator is not working in branches/types. For example:

a = load 'a';
b = load 'b';
c = union a, b;
d = cross a, b;
dump c;     // fail
dump d;     // fail

Error message: " Attempt to give operator of type org.apache.pig.impl.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POLoad multiple inputs.  This operator does not support multiple inputs."
