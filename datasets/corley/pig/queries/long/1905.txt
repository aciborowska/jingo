Pig has TOMAP, TOTUPLE, TOBAG UDF. However, it will be much easier if we can add syntax support to it:

b = foreach a generate [a0#b0] as m;
b = foreach a generate (a0, a1) as t1;
b = foreach a generate {(a0)} as b1;  -- b1 is a single tuple bag



This is a candidate project for Google summer of code 2011. More information about the program can be found at http://wiki.apache.org/pig/GSoc2011
