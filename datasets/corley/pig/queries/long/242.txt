Some Pig programs repeatedly perform operations on different versions of tables, where these versions differ only slightly. For example, a program may compute f(T) at one point and f(T + delta T) at a later point. In many such cases, having already computed f(T) can allow us to speed up the computation of f(T + delta T). For example, if f is a map operation, then f(T + delta T) is f(T) + f(delta T), which can be computed relatively rapidly if delta T is small and f(T) is already known.

It is already possible but often tedious for Pig programers to perform incremental operations. It would possibly help if Pig provided syntax for incremental operation.
