It seems that the CROSS operation is producing empty or missing results when it involves a LIMITed alias. For example, this script loads some data and appends the record count to each row. The LIMIT in this case is unnecessary but is used to demonstrate the issue:

a = load 'bug.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (word1, word2);
b = group a all;
c = foreach b generate COUNT(a) as count;
limit_c = LIMIT c 1;
d = cross a, limit_c;
dump d;

This produces empty results with my simple test data of 4 rows. However, changing it to "d = cross a, c" produces the correct results. This does not make sense because "c" and "limit_c"  have the same value.
