although this syntax is legal

%default DAYS 2
%default TWICE_AS_LONG 2*$DAYS

this one however is not.

%default DATE '2014-10-01'
DEFINE FileMask myudfs.DateFolderFileMask();
%default FOLDER FileMask('$DATE','$DAYS')

although I understand that preprocessor statements are likely done before DEFINE statements, and thus this is probably not trivial.  

however, it would be some really good syntactic sugar, if this was supported.  the current way of using %declare with backticks forces people to write additional shell scripts, rather than use the available UDF facilities.

thanks in advance!
