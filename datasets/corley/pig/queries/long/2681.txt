For  pig macros where the out parameter is referenced in a store statement, the TestDriveP.countStores() does not correctly count the number of stores:

For example, the store will not be counted in :

define myMacro(in1,in2) returns A {

 A  = load '$in1' using PigStorage('$delimeter') as (intnum1000: int,id: int,intnum5: int,intnum100: int,intnum: int,longnum: long,floatnum: float,doublenum: double);
   store $A into '$out';
}

 countStores() matches with:
             $count = $q[$i] =~ /store\s[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*\s+into/i;

Since the alias has a special character "$" it doesn't count it and the test fails.

Need to change this to:

   $count = $q[$i] =~ /store\s(\$)?[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*\s+into/i;

I'll submit a patch shortly.
