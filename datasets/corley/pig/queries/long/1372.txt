The preferred method to get the job's Configuration object would be to use UDFContext.getJobConf(). This jira is to restore PigInputFormat.sJob  (but we will be marking it deprecated and indicating to use UDFContext.getJobConf() instead) to be backward compatible - we can remove it from pig in a future release.
