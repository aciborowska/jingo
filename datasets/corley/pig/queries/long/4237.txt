Bags cannot be sent to an RDD, as it produces a SelfSpillBag$MemoryLimits not Serializable exception. This results in an error for almost every operation performed after grouping tuples.

This error is fixed after making transient the protected MemoryLimit memLimit attribute inside org.apache.pig.data.SelfSpillBag, but I do not know the impact of this change.
