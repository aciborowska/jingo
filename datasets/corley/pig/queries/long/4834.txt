I've been working on a Pig script to join some datasets recently and I think I found a bug in Left Outer Join using "skewed". In an attempt to speed up what seemed to be some joins on skewed data I used the 'skewed' keyword, but the skewed version produced a different number of results. The dataflow is quite large, but I've isolated the jobs where the results start to differ.

Non-skewed version:


	36 map tasks
	5 reduce tasks
	shortest reducer: 46sec
	longest reducer: 7min, 9sec
	input records: 16,903,866
	output records: 16,891,935




out = JOIN leftrel BY prevrel::f1 LEFT OUTER, rightrel BY f1;



Skewed version:


	36 map tasks
	5 reduce tasks
	shortest reducer: 1min, 34sec
	longest reducer: 2min, 15sec
	input records: 16,903,866
	output records: 7,916,768




out = JOIN leftrel BY prevrel::f1 LEFT OUTER, rightrel BY f1 USING 'skewed';



The two scripts are identical except for each join has USING 'skewed'. My understanding is that using "skewed" should produce the same results, except that it does a preliminary scan to determine the best reducer distribution scheme.

See attached for screenshots of the counters page for both versions.
