I was doing some experiments in pig(hadoop mode). I loaded the sample data into HDFS ,

a   A   1
b   B   2
c   C   3
a   AA  11
a   AAA 111
b   BB  22
hdfs://#######/data/one Then i logged into grunt shell,i fired the ls.I can able to see the file in the hdfs.

i loaded the data like this: data = load 'data/one' using PigStorage();

Then i fired the dump data but i am getting the error like this

Failed Jobs: JobId Alias Feature Message Outputs job_201111102206_22874 data MAP_ONLY Message: Job failed! Error - Job initialization failed: org.apache.hadoop.fs.FSError: java.io.IOException: No space left on device

. . . 2011-12-17 23:48:32,687 [main] INFO org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.MapReduceLauncher - Failed! 2011-12-17 23:48:32,689 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1066: Unable to open iterator for alias data

This same process i had executed many times,it worked for me but not now and this is also working well in local mode.

And last thing ,i had the checked the data,there is no unnecessary space.

Any suggestion!!!!!!
