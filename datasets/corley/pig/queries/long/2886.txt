I have a client that wants to use pig.  They are using MR now.  They can't use PIG right now because they only want to fetch the last day's worth of data in HBase.  A filter with time range would require reading all the HStore files.  If we hold major compaction until after the fetch and use Scan Time Range we only need to read very little in compression.
