Right now Pig uses two combiner classes (PigCombiner & DistinctCombiner) respectively for group by and distinct operations. This prevents the MultiQueryOptimizer to merge jobs with different types of combiners. The proposal here is to merge these two combiners into a single Pig combiner so that the optimizer can merge group by jobs with distinct jobs.
