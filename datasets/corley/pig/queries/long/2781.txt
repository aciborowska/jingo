While I was checking the logical operators, I found that LOSort does this while comparing two logical operators:

if (mSortFunc.equals(otherSort.getUserFunc()))
    return false;
...
if (mSortColPlans.equals(otherSort.getSortColPlans()))
    return false;

If UDF sorting functions are equal, then it returns false. Also, in the case of same sorting columns plans.
