PIG-4697 separated UDFContext specific to each vertex. But it also had an optimization to remove empty keys. That broke one user LoadFunc which was keeping the UDFContext Properties as a local variable and serializing in setLocation only if getSchema() was called. Even if UDFContext.isFrontend() logic was used it would have worked.
