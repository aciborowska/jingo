There are 37 javac warnings generated by javacc. These are out of our control and I don't find an easy way to deal with those. They fall into four categories: dep-ann, unchecked, serial, cast. The only thing I can think of to suppress them is to suppress all those categories in build.xml. But those are major categories we are checking. If we disable those, then javac warnings are not useful to Pig.
