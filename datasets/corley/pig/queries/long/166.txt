Occasionally spilling fills up (all) hard drive(s) on a Data Node and crashes Task Tracker (and other processes) on that node. We need to have a safety net and fail the task before crashing happens (and more). 

In Pig + Hadoop setting, Task Trackers get Black Listed. And Pig console gets stock at a percentage without returning nodes to cluster. I talked to Hadoop team to explore Max Percentage idea. Nodes running into this problem get into permanent problems and manual cleaning by administrator is necessary.
