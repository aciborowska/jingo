now that org.apache.hcatalog has moved to org.apache.hive.hcatalog we need to update any tests in the Pig project to use new classes.

Also any Pig documentation should be updated to use new package name.

It's probably useful to keep a clone of a few pig tests that use old package name to make sure that the backwards compat layer still works.
