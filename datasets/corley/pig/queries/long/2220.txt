For now any Pig/HBase queries would require the following jars to be explicitly added via Pig's register command:

register /usr/lib/hbase/lib/zookeeper-3.3.3-cdh3u1.jar; 
register /usr/lib/hbase/hbase-0.90.3-cdh3u1.jar; 
register /usr/lib/hbase/lib/guava-r06.jar;

the longer term solution, perhaps, should be to have the code at submit time call hbase's 
TableMapREduceUtil.addDependencyJar(job, HBaseStorageHandler.class) to ship it in distributedcache.
