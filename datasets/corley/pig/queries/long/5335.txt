Error message

2018-04-10 10:22:33,360 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.PigServer - exception during parsing: Error during parsing. Invalid field projection. Projected field [a0] does not exist in schema: a0:bytearray,a0:bytearray,a2:bytearray,a3:bytearray.


At least two issues.

	Error should be about FOREACH for C referencing non-existing field 'b1'.  But the error message is saying something about 'a0'.
	Script itself is not using relation C and D at all.  It's confusing to see errors coming out of unused relations.
