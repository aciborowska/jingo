DEFINE myawk `./test.awk` ship('./test.awk');
DEFINE mypy `python my.py` ship ('./my.py');
A = load 'input.txt';
B =  stream A through myawk ;
BB =  stream A through mypy ;
store B into '$output/abc';
store BB into '$output/bcd';

 
This script would hang when my.py fails with syntax error.
(input.txt has to large)
