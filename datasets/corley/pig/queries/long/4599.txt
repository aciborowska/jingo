I'm not completely sure whether this is the right place to put this issue since Pig is involved, however, Pig leave decompression of tar.gz to   hadoop-common.

How to reproduce the issue: 


	simple file (file1) with arbitrary text lines put into in1 in HDFS
	same file (file1) compressed by tar -cvzf file1.tar.gz file put into in2 in HDFS
	issue simple pig commands in pig:

raw = load 'in1/' USING TextLoader AS (line: bytearray);
dump raw;
run for both (compressed and uncompressed file)
	in case of compressed version you will get strange 1st line
