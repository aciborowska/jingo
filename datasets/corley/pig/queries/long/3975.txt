We noticed that multiple pig runs with same input were producing different outputs.

Simplified script looked like this.


A = load 'input1' as (a1:int);
B = group A by a1 parallel 200;
C = load 'input2' as (c1:int);
D = foreach C generate B.$0;
store D into '/tmp/deletemeD';
E = load 'input3' as (c1:int);
F = foreach E generate B.$0;
store F into '/tmp/deletemeF';
