We would like to change the HBaseStorage function to use a scheme when loading a table in pig. The scheme we are thinking of is: "hbase". So in order to load an hbase table in a pig script the statement should read:


table = load 'hbase://<tablename>' using HBaseStorage();



If the scheme is omitted pig would assume the tablename to be an hdfs path and the storage function would use the last component of the path as a table name and output a warning.

For details on why see jira issue: PIG-758
