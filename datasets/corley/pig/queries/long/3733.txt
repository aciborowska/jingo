Pig fails to concatenate semi-colon to a column in a generate statement. I've tried multiple ways including unicode version (u003B), but fails.


grunt> a = load '/user/smallem/mem.csv' using PigStorage('|') as (uid:int, sid:chararray);
grunt> b = foreach a generate uid as uid, CONCAT('v=1;',sid) as sids;
<line 3, column 0>  mismatched character '<EOF>' expecting '''

The same however works when used nested statement.


grunt> a = load '/user/smallem/mem.csv' using PigStorage('|') as (uid:int, sid:chararray);
grunt> b = foreach a {                                                                    
>>         x = CONCAT('v=1;',sid);
>>         generate uid as memberuid, x as sids ;
>> };
grunt>
