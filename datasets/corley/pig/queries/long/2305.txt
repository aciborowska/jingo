It would be helpful  if Pig can log the split information in the task logs. 
MAPREDUCE-2076 talks about having this log, but from Pig 0.8 onwards, splits could be combined hence not sure what
could be the result. One side effect would be that these logs  will get printed on intermediate pig jobs also.
