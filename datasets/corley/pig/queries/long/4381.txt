When user executes a define command from the grunt shell and if the command spans across multiple lines the following exception is thrown:


2014-12-23 11:29:32,637 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1000: Error during parsing. Lexical error at line 2, column 0. Encountered: <EOF> after : ""

The same command works fine with a Pig script file.
