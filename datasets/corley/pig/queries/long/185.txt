I was trying to run the following Pig script with the latest Pig stuff. Since essentially I was streaming 2 identical sets of data, I was expecting the final result which is the count of the name field to contain all even numbers. However, lots of odd number showed up in the actual result.


define X `perl -ne 'chomp $_; print "$_\n"' - ./user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k` cache('/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k');
A = load '/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k';
B = stream A through X as (name, age, gpa);
C = group B by name;
D = foreach C generate COUNT(B.$0);
store D into 'results_22';
