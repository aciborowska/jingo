Currently, the GROUPBY operator of PIG is mapped by Spark's CoGroup. When the grouped data is consumed by subsequent operations to perform algebraic operations, this is sub-optimal as there is lot of shuffle traffic. 

The Spark Plan must be optimized to use reduceBy, where possible, so that a combiner is used.
