PigPen has been found to be a usable feature. The underlying PIG functionality, ILLUSTRATE, however, has not been stable and complete. It also has unique access paths that  are not shared by the mainstream PIG call paths, which makes it hard if not impossible to maintain as the PIG evolves along.

The purpose of this work is to use the common access paths yet still follow the performance-sensitive criteria for ILLUSTRATE, complete support for as many logical operators as theoretically possible,
plus algorithm polishes and bug fixes as necessary. Details can be found in http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigIllustrate

Pig-366 has been for the PigPen in general, and was used for the previous ILLUSTRATE work too. With this JIRA, the work on ILLUSTRATE will be separated.

This JIRA also serves as an umbrella for existing issues in ILLUSTRATE. Specifically, PIG-502, PIG-903, PIG-1066 should all fold into this issue.
