To benchmark Pig performance, we need to have a TPC-H like Large Data Set plus Script Collection. This is used in comparison of different Pig releases, Pig vs. other systems (e.g. Pig + Hadoop vs. Hadoop Only).

Here is Wiki for small tests: http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigPerformance

I am currently running long-running Pig scripts over data-sets in the order of tens of TBs. Next step is hundreds of TBs.

We need to have an open large-data set (open source scripts which generate data-set) and detailed scripts for important operations such as ORDER, AGGREGATION etc.

We can call those the Pig Workouts: Cardio (short processing), Marathon (long running scripts) and Triathlon (Mix). 

I will update this JIRA with more details of current activities soon.
