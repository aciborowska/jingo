There are a number of cases where people (co)group their data, and then pass it to an operator other than foreach with a UDF, but where an accumulator like interface would still make sense.  A few examples:


C = group B by $0;
D = foreach C generate flatten(B);
...

C = group B by $0;
D = stream C through 'script.py';
...

C = group B by $0;
store C into 'output';



In all these cases the following operator does not require all the data to be held in memory at once.  There may be others beyond this.  Changing this part of the pipeline would greatly speed these types of queries and make them less likely to die with out of memory errors.
