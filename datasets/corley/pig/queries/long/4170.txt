The following script produce wrong result:

A = load '1.txt' as (i:int, s:chararray);
B = group A by i;
C = group A by s;
store B into 'ooo1';
store C into 'ooo2';


1.txt:

1       h
1       a


Expected: 

ooo1:
1       {(1,a),(1,h)}
ooo2:
a       {(1,a)}
h       {(1,h)}


Actual:

ooo1:
1       {((1),a),((1),h)}
ooo2:
a       {(1,(a))}
h       {(1,(h))}


This happens after PIG-3591.
