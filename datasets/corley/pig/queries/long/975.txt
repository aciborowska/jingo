POPackage uses DefaultDataBag during reduce process to hold data. It is registered with SpillableMemoryManager and prone to OutOfMemoryException.  It's better to pro-actively managers the usage of the memory. The bag fills in memory to a specified amount, and dump the rest the disk.  The amount of memory to hold tuples is configurable. This can avoid out of memory error.
