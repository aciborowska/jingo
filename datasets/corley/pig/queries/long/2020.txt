The following query seems valid:

A = load 'x';
B = foreach A 
{ T = filter $0 by $1 > $2; generate T; }
;
Store B into 'y';

However, the query fails due to validation error in 0.8:

2011-04-28 09:08:06,846 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1026: Attempt to fetch field 1 from schema of size 1

Similar error is given in 0.9.
