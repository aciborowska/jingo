If my Pig StorFunc has its own OutputFormat class then Pig MapReducelauncher will try to instantiate it before
launching the mapreduce job and fail with ClassNotFoundException.

This happens because Pig MapReduce launcher uses its own classloader and ignores the classes in the jars in the
register statement.

The effect is that the jars not only have to be in "register " statement in the script but also in the pig
classpath with the -classpath tag. 

This can be remedied by making the Pig MapReduceLauncher constructing a classloader that includes the registered jars
and using that to instantiate the OutputFormat class.
