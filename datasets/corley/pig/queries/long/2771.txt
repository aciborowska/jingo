It is not uncommon to use LIMIT clauses just after a LOAD, especially during the development phase of new scripts.

The current behaviour is to do the LIMIT in the map phase just after the LOAD, this means that the output of each Mapper has indeed N records if a 'LIMIT x N' was used, but the LoadFunc has read all the records in its splits.

A nice optimization would be to push to the LoadFunc the fact that only the first N records are needed, this way the LOAD would terminate as soon as each Mapper have produced N records, which can speed up things quite a bit when input is large.
