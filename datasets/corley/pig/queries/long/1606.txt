From the existing flatten documentation, it is not clear that flatten of an empty bag results in that row being discarded .

For example the following query gives no output -

grunt> cat /tmp/empty.bag
{}      1
grunt> l = load '/tmp/empty.bag' as (b : bag{}, i : int);
grunt> f = foreach l generate flatten(b), i;
grunt> dump f;
grunt>
