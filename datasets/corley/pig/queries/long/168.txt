Looking at http://incubator.apache.org/pig/deployment.html#Running+Pig+Programs i noticed following things:
(1) there is no information about the /bin/pig shell script
(2) i missed information that i can run pig in local mode (without pointing to a hadoop-site.xml)

Especially (2) i think would be important for new users, so they have a fast start.
