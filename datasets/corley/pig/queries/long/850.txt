The following script will wrongly produce 20 output, however, if we change dump to "store into", the result is correct. Not sure if the problem is only for limited sort case.

A = load '/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k' as (name, age, gpa);
B = order A by gpa parallel 2;
C = limit B 10;
dump C;
