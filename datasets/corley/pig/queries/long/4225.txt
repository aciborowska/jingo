The current PythonScriptEngine uses whatever python is currently on the path in order to execute scripts.

Python users are accustomed to creating virtual environments (virtualenvs) where associated requirements are installed without needing to worry about "global" installs via, for example, sudo pip install <some package>.

Is it possible to have the Python executable specified either via the DEFINE command syntax or, in a hadoop job configuration variable? Perhaps pig.pythonstreaming.pythonpath?
