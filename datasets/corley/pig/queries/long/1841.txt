I sent this to the list:

I'm looking at Pig's TupleSize implementation and wondering if it's
implemented correctly:

   @Override
   public Long exec(Tuple input) throws IOException {
       try
{
           if (input == null) return null;
           return Long.valueOf(input.size());
       }
catch(Exception e)
{
           int errCode = 2106;
           String msg = "Error while computing size in " +
this.getClass().getSimpleName();
           throw new ExecException(msg, errCode, PigException.BUG,
e);
       }
   }


I have a script that looks like

A = FOREACH A GENERATE STRSPLIT(value, '\u0001') AS values;
B = FOREACH B GENERATE values, SIZE(values) AS cnt;

and cnt always ends up as 1.  From the code, it looks like TupleSize
is intended to only return the number of arguments into the SIZE()
UDF?  Is that really the intention and I'm using the SIZE() UDF wrong?
 Or, is it just a bug and it's supposed to be written as "return
Long.valueOf(((Tuple) input.get(0)).size()))"?


I got this response back:

This is definitely a bug. Can you open a Jira ticket?

Done!
