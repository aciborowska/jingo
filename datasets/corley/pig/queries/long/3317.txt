Pig provides a number of optimizations which are described at http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.11.1/perf.html#optimization-rules. As is described in the docs, all or specific optimizations can be disabled via the command-line.

Currently the caller of a pig script must know which optimizations to disable when running because that information cannot be set in the script itself. Nor can optimizations be disabled site-wide through pig.properties.

Pig should allow disabling optimizations via properties so that pig scripts themselves can disable optimizations as needed, rather than the caller needing to know what optimizations to disable on the command-line.
