For the following query:

A = load 'x' as (u:int, v, w);
B = load 'y' as (w:int);
C = cogroup A by u, B by w using 'merge';

Pis is happy with no parsing error. However, if 'merge' were replaced with 'collected', resulting a negative test case, Pig gives incorrect error message:

grunt> C = cogroup A by u, B by w using 'collected';
2011-04-14 10:39:10,155 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1200: can't look backwards more than one token in this stream

It seems this is a regression introduced lately.
