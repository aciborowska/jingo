If partial aggregation is turned on in pig 10 and 11, 20% (by default) of the available heap can be consumed by the POPartialAgg operator. This can cause memory issues for jobs that use all, or nearly all, of the heap already.

If we make POPartialAgg "spillable" (trigger compaction when memory reduction is required), we would be much nicer to high-memory jobs.
