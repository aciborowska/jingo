turing_jython is quite messy. In this ticket, I clean up the test suits and fix several issues:
1. The simple load/store with no param test repeated 3 times in different context
2. bring back Jython_Properties
3. Jython_Error_[4,5,7] are not test the right negative condition
4. comments does not match test
