The project does not compile because of this line in Main.java

import org.apache.hadoop.util.HadoopExe;

From HADOOP-435, the patch to introduce this class has been canceled plus the class itself is not being used at all in Main.java.

The simple patch removes that particular line and now the project compiles successfully.
