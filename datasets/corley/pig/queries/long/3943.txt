By default, NullableBag will write out a DefaultDataBag which inherits the write/readFields methods of DefaultAbstractBag. We found the two are inconsistent:

    public void readFields(DataInput in) throws IOException {
        long size = in.readLong();

        for (long i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            try {
                Object o = sedes.readDatum(in);
                add((Tuple)o);
            } catch (ExecException ee) {
                throw ee;
            }
        }
    }

   public void write(DataOutput out) throws IOException {
        sedes.writeDatum(out, this);
    }


when writing out, the first byte will be one of TINYBAG, SMALLBAG or BAG, followed by size which would be a byte, short or long accordingly. Regardless of that format, the readFields method directly reads size as a long.
