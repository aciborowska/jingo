Currently the Hive components in Piggybank download, extra, rename and copy the necessary Hive jars manually in Ant via the download-hive-deps target (incidentally, it's downloading 0.4, an ancient version). This plays havoc with IDEs that may be trying to load the Hive classes and resolve dependencies automatically through Hive, and is also fragile.  This component should be updated to use Ivy to resolve the Hive dependency.
