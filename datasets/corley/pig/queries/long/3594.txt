 When running the following pig query (script.pig) :

A = LOAD ' my_data' USING org.apache.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();
B = FILTER A by part1=='$val1' and part2 matches '$val2';
C = FILTER  B by map#'key' matches '(val3|val4)';
DUMP C;

> pig -useHCatalog -p val1=2013_01_01 val2=XYZ script.pig

This results in Pig scanning all partitions inspite of filter condition. part1=='$val1' should have been pushed to HCatLoader even though there are other conditions that cannot be pushed.
