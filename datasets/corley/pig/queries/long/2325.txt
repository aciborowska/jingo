Right now the place for the data generated in e2e tests is hardcoded in test/e2e/pig/conf/default.conf as:

 $cfg = {
     #HDFS
      'inpathbase'     => '/user/pig/tests/data'
    , 'outpathbase'    => '/user/pig/out'



It would be better to make it configurable (with an environment variable?) as the rest of the paths.
