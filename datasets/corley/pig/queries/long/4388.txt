 With PIG-4387, realized that the way we put all *-site.xml in pigcontext properties is kind of a mess now with the switching between Properties and Configuration. Also pc.getProperties() is populated initially with all the *-default/site.xml settings but still there are lot of calls to ConfigurationUtil.toConfiguration(pc.getProperties(), true); to include those again.  It might be simpler to have one computed Configuration object as part of PigContext and use that everywhere.
