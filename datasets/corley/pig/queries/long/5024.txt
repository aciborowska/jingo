Currently, when optimize some kinds of JOIN, the indexed or sampling files are saved into HDFS. By setting the replication to a larger number, it serves as distributed cache.

Spark's broadcast mechanism is suitable for this. It seems that we can add a physical operator to broadcast small RDDs.
This will benefit the optimization of some specialized Joins, such as Skewed Join, Replicated Join and so on.
