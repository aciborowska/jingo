It seems is caused by the infinite loop in the code:
BasicTable, Line 698

        while (true)
        {
          int index = random.nextInt(cgScanners.length - 1) + 1;
          if (cgScanners[index] != null) {
            if (cgScanners[index].atEnd() != ret) {
              throw new IOException(
                  "atEnd() failed: Column Groups are not evenly positioned.");
            }
            break;
          }
        }



I think it's fine to just use a for loop here, like:

        for (int index = 0; index < cgScanners.length; index++) {
          if (cgScanners[index] != null) {
            if (cgScanners[index].atEnd() != ret) {
              throw new IOException(
                  "atEnd() failed: Column Groups are not evenly positioned.");
            }
            break;
          }
        }
