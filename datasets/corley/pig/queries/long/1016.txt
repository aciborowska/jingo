Hi, I'm trying to load a map that has a tuple for value. The read fails in 0.4.0 because of a misconfiguration in the parser. Where as in almost all documentation it is stated that value of the map can be any time.

I've attached a patch that allows us to read in complex objects as value as documented. I've done simple verification of loading in maps with tuple/map values and writing them back out using LOAD and STORE. All seems to work fine.
