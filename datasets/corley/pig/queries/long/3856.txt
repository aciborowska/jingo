Replicate join input that was broadcast to union vertex now needs to be broadcast to all the union predecessors. So we need to

	Create edges from the Replicate join input to all the union predecessors
	Change replicate join input to write to multiple outputs.



This can be further optimized by using a shared edge which is yet to be implemented in Tez (TEZ-391)
