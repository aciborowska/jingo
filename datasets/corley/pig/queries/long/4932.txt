UDF in pig throws error when input is fed to the UDF after applying LIMIT operator. The UDF is not able to find the cache file when using LIMIT

org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecException: ERROR 2078: Caught error from UDF: org.test.hadoop.pig.BagProcess [Caught exception: File './names_cache' does not exist]

By removing the LIMIT and directly feeding the input to UDF it runs fine. LIMIT operator seems to not load the cache files causing the issue. I was able to regenerate this on two different cluster running 0.14.0 version of hive
