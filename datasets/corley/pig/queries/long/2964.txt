PigStats.JobGraph currently provides an iterator. The rationale behind providing a List getter is that it simply provides a lot more methods than an iterator. One could do that in the caller code, but providing this helper in the API would be beneficial. For eg, a framework that is used by clients could initiate several pig scripts/store commands at once. At the framework layer, you might want to be able to determine the number of MR jobs in total spawned by these multiple scripts and query stats on those. That's just one use-case, there could be more methods on List that a user could be interested in.
