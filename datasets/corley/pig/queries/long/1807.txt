A possible implementation could be:
init(UDFContext);
destroy(UDFContext);

This would enable initializing UDFs without requiring static calls in the constructor.
Static calls and singletons is one of the reasons pig can not execute different pig scripts in different threads.

Some useful information to add in the UDFContext:

	inputSchema
	whether the UDF is instantiated on the client side (parsing) or on a slave (runtime).
