Pig uses DistributedCache.addFileToClassPath api that puts jars on distributed cache configuration. This uses : to separate list of files to be put of classpath via distributed cache. If fs.default.name has port number in it, it causes the tokenization logic to fail in hadoop for retrieving list of cache filenames in backend.
