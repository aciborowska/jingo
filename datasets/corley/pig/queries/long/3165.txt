One often needs to drop an old MongoDB store when replacing it. Ex:

store answer into 'mongodb://localhost/agile_data.hourly_from_reply_probs' using MongoStorage();

Before doing that you would likely want to run a mongo command from bash from grunt, to drop it:

sh mongo --eval 'db.hourly_from_reply_probs.drop();'

However, in this case grunt acts as though the command never returns. Crap!
