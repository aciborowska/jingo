Currently, DISTINCT is implemented in a straightforward manner per https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-3538.

However, we can implement two types of combiner optimizations for DISTINCT, just as the MRCompiler does for map-reduce:
1. A simple DistinctCombiner that throws away the duplicate tuples
2. An optimizer that transforms certain uses of DISTINCT into an algebraic udf form
