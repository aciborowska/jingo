A number of pig scripts follow the pattern:

File tempFile = File.createTempFile("this", ".txt");
copyFromLocalToCluster (tempFile.to_string(), tempFile.to_string());
tempFile.delete();

The goal, here, seems to be to generate a temp filename to avoid issues on the next run if the file doesn't get cleaned up.  The problem is that File.createTempFile on Windows creates files with names like C:\users\myuser\App data\local\temp\file.txt.  The problem is that ":" is not a valid DFS character and so the put fails.

The easy fix on this is to remove colons from the path before upload.  Then we get something like C\users\myuser\App data\local\temp\file.txt which is a valid DFS pathname with minimal impact to the tests.
