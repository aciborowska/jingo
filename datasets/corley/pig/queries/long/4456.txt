Sort the leaves by SparkOperator.operatorKey to guarantee that sparkOperator with smaller operatorKey is executed before those with larger operatorKey if both are the leaves of spark plan, for example, sparkOperator(scope-65) and sparkOperator(scope-67) are all leaves of spark plan. SparkOperator(scope-65) should be executed before sparkOperator(scope-67) because the output of scope-65 maybe is used by scope-67.
