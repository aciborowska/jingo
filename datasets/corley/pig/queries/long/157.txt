This is the tracking bug for the work to add types to pig and rework the execution pipeline.  Individual components of this work are covered in subtasks.

Functional and design specs for this work are:
http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigTypesFunctionalSpec
http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigTypesDesign
http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigExecutionModel

This work is being done on the branch types, since it is large and disruptive, and we want to be able to do incremental checkins without causing issues for the trunk.
