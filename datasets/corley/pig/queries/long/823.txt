This JIRA is created to track development of a metadata system for  Hadoop. The goal of the system is to allow users and applications to register data stored on HDFS, search for the data available on HDFS, and associate metadata such as schema, statistics, etc. with a particular data unit or a data set stored on HDFS. The initial goal is to provide a fairly generic, low level abstraction that any user or application on HDFS can use to store an retrieve metadata. Over time a higher level abstractions closely tied to particular applications or tools can be developed.

Over time, it would make sense for the metadata service to become a subproject within Hadoop. For now, the proposal is to make it a contrib to Pig since Pig SQL is likely to be the first user of the system.
