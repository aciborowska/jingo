Currently we have '#'  for GET operation. We need to have more Map operations e.g. PUT. 

To address the immediate need I wrote a simple UDF for mapPut(). 

Also we need to discuss what operation/keyword to put into language.

On a side note:

Currently UDF cannot return DataMap (class is not recognized and value is not carried from UDF to caller script).

So I put it in a DataBag to make it work.
