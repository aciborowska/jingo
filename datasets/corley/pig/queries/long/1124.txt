As a Hadoop user I want to control the Job name for my analysis via the command line using the following construct::

java -cp pig.jar:$HADOOP_HOME/conf -Dmapred.job.name=hadoop_junkie org.apache.pig.Main broken.pig

-Dmapred.job.name should normally set my Hadoop Job name, but somehow during the formation of the job.xml in Pig this information is lost and the job name turns out to be:

"PigLatin:broken.pig"

The current workaround seems to be wiring it in the script itself, using the following ( or using parameter substitution).

set job.name 'my job'
