This fails

clean = FOREACH log {
    ev = eventType eq '/rate/video'?'none':eventType;
    GENERATE ev as event, 1 as cnt;
}


but this works

clean = FOREACH log {
    ev = (eventType eq '/rate/video'?'none':eventType);
    GENERATE ev as event, 1 as cnt;
}

The requirement for parens is bogus.  Also, this fails with very misleading messages:

clean = FOREACH log {
    ev = (eventType eq '/rate/video')?'none':eventType;
    GENERATE ev as event, 1 as cnt;
}

I think that the parser needs to be completely revamped to avoid this sort of strangeness.
