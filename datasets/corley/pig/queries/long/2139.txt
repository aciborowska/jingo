LogicalExpressionSimplifier simplifies filter expressions. In the process, it compares udfs to see if they are 'equal' (ie expected to produce same results). But it does not check if the udfs are annotated as @Nondeterministic. If such an annotation exists, then the udfs should not be considered equal. UserFuncition.isEqual() is being used to compare the udfs.
