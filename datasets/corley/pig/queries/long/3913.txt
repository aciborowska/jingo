MapreduceLauncher initializes a statsJobClient to poll counter information of jobs. This works fine in mapreduce mode but it reports incorrect information in local (auto-local) mode. Pig code should try to use org.apache.hadoop.mapred.jobcontrol.Job's getJobClient api to get handle to jobClient wherever possible. statsJobClient (and wherever its references are passed) should be deprecated.
