Currently if we have a UDF that declares via getArgToFuncMapping that it can only handle a subset of types, passing any other types to the function would result in an error. However, some types can be promoted to others and it would be useful if typechecker to perform best fit cast. For instance, if the input parameter has type of Long and the UDF support Int and Double, the code should cast the paraneter into Double.

This would be very useful for conversion of the UDFs from the piigybank to the new code.
