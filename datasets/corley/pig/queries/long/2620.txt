The current behavior of Pig when handling exceptions thrown by UDFs is to fail and stop processing. We want to extend this behavior to let user have finer grain control on error handling.

Depending on the use-case there are several options users would like to have:

Stop the execution and report an error
Ignore tuples that cause exceptions and log warnings
Ignore tuples that cause exceptions and redirect them to an error relation (to enable statistics, debugging, ...)
Write their own error handler
