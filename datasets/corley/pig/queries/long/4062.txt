Builtin TOP function orders records in descending order. However in lot of cases you might want to get top N records in ascending order, such as when ordering records by rank, etc. The idea is to extend the TOP function so that it can be configured via DEFINE statement. For example 

DEFINE TOPASC TOP("ASC");

To keep it backward compatible, the top function by default will continue to order in descending order.
