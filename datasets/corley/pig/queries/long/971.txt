ARITY is not documented in Pig Latin Manual:

http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/docs/r0.3.0/piglatin.html

It is only 1 time mentioned in FAQ:

"Q: How do I prevent failure if some records don't have the needed number of columns?

You can filter away those records by including the following in your Pig program:

A = LOAD 'foo' USING PigStorage('\t');
B = FILTER A BY ARITY < 5;
.....

This code would drop all records that have fewer than five (5) columns."
