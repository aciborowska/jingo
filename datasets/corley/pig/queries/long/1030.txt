this scprit does not work

register /homes/yinghe/owl/string.jar;
a = load '/user/yinghe/a.txt' as (id, color);
b = group a all;
c = foreach b {
    d = distinct a.color;
    generate group, string.BagCount2(d), string.ColumnLen2(d, 0);
}

the udfs are regular, not algebraic.

then if I call  "dump c;" or "explain c", I would get  this error message.
ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 2019: Expected to find plan with single leaf. Found 2 leaves.

The error only occurs for the first time, after getting this error, if I call "dump c" or "explain c" again, it would succeed.
