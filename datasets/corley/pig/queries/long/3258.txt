I have made a patch to enable MultiStorage to handle multiple tuple indexes, rather than only one, for generating the output directory structure.  Before I submit it, though, I need to know if I should generate the patch from /contrib/piggybank/java where I've been compiling and unit testing, or back at the project root.
