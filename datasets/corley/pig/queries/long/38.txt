I am developing Pig Pen, an Eclipse plugin for Pig. Pig Pen needs to parse .pig scripts. The parsing is the same as for grunt, but the actions I take are different (e.g., Pig Pen will ignore "store" commands for the purpose of editing).

What I'd like to do is create an abstract class PigScriptParser, which is identical to the current GruntParser except no actions are taken. Then I'll add a GruntParser that extends PigScriptParser, and has concrete implementations of actions (e.g., what to do when a "store" command is encountered).

I'll also add a PigPenParser that also extends PigScriptParser.

This should not affect the behavior of GruntParser at all â€“ it just separates the parsing from the actuating.
