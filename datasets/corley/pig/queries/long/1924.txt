CSVExcelStorage() combines load and store of CSV encoded data. Handles newlines within fields, escaped double quotes, and double quoting of fields with embedded field delimiters. Newline handling is optional, and controlled by a parameter. The module also offers an option to output with Windows style newlines (CRLF, instead of the Unix LF). All CSV related syntax decisions were made to match Excel 2007.

The module comes with a test file, and javadoc produces proper documentation files.
