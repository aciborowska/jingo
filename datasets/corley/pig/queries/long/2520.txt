I ran local mode tests with dotNext without client side tables(CST) enabled and local mode works.
I also ran regression suites with client side tables enabled and they pass. The regressions use old style references for hdfs.
I ran local mode tests with client side tables enabled and it fails.

It seems to me that wether cst are enabled or not, local mode should work since it's not using hdfs.
