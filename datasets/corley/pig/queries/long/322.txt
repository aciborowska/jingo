The only job name used for a series of map-reduce jobs is the one before STORE, even if SET job.name is used multiple number of times. Though it is known that there exists no direct mapping between (a set of) pig statements and the map-reduce jobs, and Pig tries to optimize the number of map-reduce jobs, having the ability to have different names for the map-reduce jobs triggered by Pig is a useful feature that allows better tracking.

If no job.name is SET, may be Pig can tag along a count in the name, instead of the default "PigLatin:DefaultJobName"

The issue of associating a name explicitly SET by the user with a map-reduce job can be more tricky though when the name is set multiple times.
