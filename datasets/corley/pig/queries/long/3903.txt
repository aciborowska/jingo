FileInputFormat calculates the split size as 
Math.max(minSize, Math.min(maxSize, blockSize));

By default pig.maxCombinedSplitSize is 128MB if pig.noSplitCombinaton is not specifically turned off. We should set the mapred.min.split.size (if not already set by the user) to same as pig.maxCombinedSplitSize, so the underlying FileInputFormat itself gives us bigger splits when possible instead of pig combining smaller splits.
