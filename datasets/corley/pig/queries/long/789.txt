Many user's pig script do something like this:

a = load '/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k' as (name, age, gpa);
c = filter a by age > 500;
e = group c by (name, age);
f = foreach e generate group, COUNT($1);
store f into 'bla';
f1 = load 'bla';
g = order f1 by $1;
dump g;

With the inclusion of the multi-query phase2 patch this appears to no longer work.  You get an error:

2009-04-28 18:24:50,776 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 2100: hdfs://wilbur11.labs.corp.sp1.yahoo.com/user/gates/bla does not exist.

We shouldn't be checking for bla's existence here because it will be created eventually by the script.
