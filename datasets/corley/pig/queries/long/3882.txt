Currently, if it is multiquery off mode, the pig script is executed whenever a STORE is encountered. This becomes even more inefficient in Tez as multiple DAGs are launched. And it is also not possible to do explain if multiquery is off because of this. Should switch to batch mode. Only difference should be that MultiQueryOptimizer is not applied in multiquery off mode.
