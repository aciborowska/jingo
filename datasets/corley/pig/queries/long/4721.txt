The documentation example uses a left outer join, but this produces a flat tuple, which is invalid for IsEmpty. I believe the example in the docs should be:


SSN = load 'ssn.txt' using PigStorage() as (ssn:long);

SSN_NAME = load 'students.txt' using PigStorage() as (ssn:long, name:chararray);

/* do a cogroup of SSN with SSN_Name */
X = COGROUP SSN by ssn, SSN_NAME by ssn;

/* only keep those ssn's for which there is no name */
Y = filter X by IsEmpty(SSN_NAME);
