Several users complained that EXPLAIN output is too verbose and is hard to make sense of.

One way to improve the situation is to realize is that EXPLAIN actually contains several plans: logical, physical, backend specific. So we can update EXPLAIN to allow to show a particular plan. For instance

EXPLAIN LOGICAL A;

would show only logical plan.
