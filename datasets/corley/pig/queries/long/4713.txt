Release notes of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-2328 should go into Builtin Functions (https://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.15.0/func.html) of Apache Pig documentation.  

Saw one user trying to use Bloom Filter to filter data on a different column than the join column which should not be done as Bloom Filters give false positives and can include records that actually don't match the filter criteria. That should be documented as well and highlighted to avoid users trying to use Bloom Filters for just regular filtering.
