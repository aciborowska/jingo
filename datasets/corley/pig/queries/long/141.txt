A nice-to-have enhancement is for grunt to report error immediately when there are mismatching quotes in the store clause. For instance,

store C into 'results";


Currently, grunt stays without doing anything after I typed the ending ";" and then ENTER, until I type something else. Since ";" already signals the end of the clause, then after ENTER, grunt should be able to identify the syntactic error immediately.
