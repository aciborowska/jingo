The following script:

A = LOAD 'bug.in' AS a:tuple(x:int, y:int);
B1 = FOREACH A GENERATE a.x, a.y;
B2 = FOREACH A GENERATE a.x, a.y;
C = JOIN B1 BY x, B2 by x;

yields the following error:

org.apache.pig.impl.plan.PlanValidationException: ERROR 2270: Logical plan invalid state: duplicate uid in schema : B1::x#35:int,B1::y#36:int,B2::x#35:int,B2::y#36:int
