We would add the Parquet jar in the Pig packages to make it available out of the box to pig users.
On top of that we could add the parquet.pig package to the list of packages to search for UDFs. (alternatively, the parquet jar could contain classes name or.apache.pig.builtin.ParquetLoader and ParquetStorer)
This way users can use Parquet simply by typing:
A = LOAD 'foo' USING ParquetLoader();
STORE A INTO 'bar' USING ParquetStorer();
