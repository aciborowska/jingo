When loading data into HBase with HBaseStorage, there is unexpected behavior regarding record schema and casting.

Here is the relevant code snippet:

B = group A by (time_tuple, some_scalar);
C = foreach B {
	-- UDF to generate id (bytearray)
	generate id, flatten(group.$0), COUNT(A);
}



At this point the schema for C is unknown, so I declare a schema with a foreach statement


D = foreach C generate $0 as id:bytearray, $1 as year:int, $2 as month:int, $3 as date:int, $4 as count:int;



Even though I've declared C.$4 as an int, it is still a long (from the COUNT). When I go to insert into HBase I get a ClassCastException since the schema (int) does not match the actual tuple value (long). I can fix this by explicitly casting when I declare the schema.


D = foreach C generate $0 as id:bytearray, $1 as year:int, $2 as month:int, $3 as date:int, (int)$4 as count:int;



Is this expected behavior? If not, is this an HBaseStorage issue - not honoring the schema before going off casting things?
