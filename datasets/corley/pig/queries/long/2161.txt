TOTUPLE udf gets an input tuple, creates a new list, puts every field from the tuple into the list, and creates a new tuple by calling TupleFactory.newTuple(List<Object>) method – which in turn allocates another list and copies everything in there.

Simply returning the input tuple should be sufficient – Pig already did the work of putting the arguments into a tuple.
