When Parser emits an error from one of the tree parsers (like AST validation or plan generation), Line number is missing or printed as Line 0:0. Further investigation shows that Antlr 3.2 isn't able to report the correct line number and line offset. We need to address it in Pig code.

The following is an example.

grunt> A = load 'x' as (u, v, u, w);
2011-03-21 10:04:44,486 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 0: Duplicated alias in schema: u


It's desirable to have line number/offset in such kind of error messages.
