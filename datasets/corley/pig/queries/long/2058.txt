For the following query:

define test( out1,out2 ){
   A  = load 'x' as (u:int, v:int);
   $B  = filter A by u < 3 and v <  20;
}

Pig gives the following error message: Syntax error,unexpected symbol at or near '{'

Previously, it gives: mismatched input '{' expecting RETURNS

The previous message is more meaningful.
