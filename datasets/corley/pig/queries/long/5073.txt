E2E test Limit_5 tests

a = load ':INPATH:/singlefile/studenttab10k';
b = load ':INPATH:/singlefile/votertab10k';
a1 = foreach a generate $0, $1;
b1 = foreach b generate $0, $1;
c = union a1, b1;
d = limit c 100;
store d into ':OUTPATH:';



but with Tez, this test result is not stable in that optimization may pick just one of the input.
