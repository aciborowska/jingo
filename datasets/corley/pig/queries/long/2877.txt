This wires foreaches to use SchemaTuple. As an aside, while SchemaTuple is not turned on by default, I made sure that it worked with ant test-commit if it were (there were some edge cases and lifecycle stuff that needed to be cleaned up).

Further, I refactored some of the tests that I needed to work with for other reasons to be much cleaner.
