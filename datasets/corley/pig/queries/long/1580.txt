mapreduce operator (PIG-506) and stream operator have some similarities. It makes sense to use a similar syntax for both.

Alan has proposed the following syntax for mapreduce operator, and that we move stream operator also to similar a syntax in a future release.

MAPREDUCE id jar
         INPUT  'path' USING LoadFunc  
        OUTPUT  'path' USING StoreFunc
        [SHIP 'path' [, 'path' ...]]
        [CACHE 'dfs_path#dfs_file' , 'dfs_path#dfs_file' ...]
