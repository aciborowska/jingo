'union onshcema' creates a merged schema based on the input schemas. It does that in the queryparser, and at that stage the udf return type used is the default return type.  The actual return type for the udf is determined later in the TypeCheckingVisitor using EvalFunc.getArgsToFuncMapping().
'union onschema' should use the final type for its input relation to create the merged schema.
