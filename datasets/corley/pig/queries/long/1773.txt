The documentation appears to be out of date in regards to casting chararrays.
http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.7.0/piglatin_ref2.html#Cast+Operators lists chararray as being uncastable to anything else.

This isn't the case since PIG-893 


grunt> x = load 'tmp/numbers' as (a:chararray, b:chararray);
grunt> y = foreach x generate ((long) b) + 1;               
grunt> z = foreach y generate (chararray) $0;               
grunt> dump y
