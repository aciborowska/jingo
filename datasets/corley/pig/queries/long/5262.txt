For some Scala classes jdiff produces returntype="<any>". Then it fails parsing the XML because of the < and > characters. Need to fix this, and also fail the build if such thing happens, rather than having it continue and end as "BUILD SUCCESSFUL":


 
[javadoc] JDiff: reading the new API in from file '/Users/szita/shadow/apache/pig/17RC/src/docs/jdiff/pig_0.17.0-SNAPSHOT.xml'...Fatal Error (30267): parsing XML API file:org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; systemId: file:///Users/szita/shadow/apache/pig/17RC/src/docs/jdiff/pig_0.17.0-SNAPSHOT.xml; lineNumber: 30267; columnNumber: 40; The value of attribute "return" associated with an element type "method" must not contain the '<' character.
