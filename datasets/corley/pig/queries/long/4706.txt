I am using Hadoop version 2.7.1 and Pig version 0.15.0. What should the value of PIG_HADOOP_VERSION be? Couldn't find anywhere. I am facing this problem of DataStorageException where it's wrongly picking up the tmp directory. I am guessing the issue is with version mismatch. But if not, then where can I set user.home path?
