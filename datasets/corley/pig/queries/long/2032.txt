This is from a mail I sent Ben and Chris in feb
â€”

Essentially the changes are :

a) Allow for progress reporting so that long running agent api invocations dont result in killing the task.

b) Decouple creation from initialization of monitor agent harness.

c) I increased the threads for coordinator since ibis has slightly io bound coordinator messages to be processed : but this might not be generally relevant.
Maybe some way to configure it would be good ? (The default value was observed to be exhausted really fast for some invocations of ibis !)


d) Handle shutdown more gracefully at the agent side - monitor and wait for relevant future's to be complete.
Note that the code for this is slightly sensitive in terms of how it is written since there are idioms in netty which it supports (immediate invocation vs deferred invocation on future completion).
