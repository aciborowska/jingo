Executing PigUnit against a script which uses the import command always fails with error:
org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.FrontendException: ERROR 1000: Error during parsing. <line 4> : Duplicated import file 'somemacro.pig'

Even though the script being tested does not preform an import of the same script twice.  

I've tried with a couple of different scripts/tests and it appears that PigUnit fails on any test of a pig script where an import command is issued.
