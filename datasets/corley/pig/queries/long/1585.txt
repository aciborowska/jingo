New properties:

Compression:

pig.tmpfilecompression, default to false, tells if the temporary files should be compressed or not. If true, then 
pig.tmpfilecompression.codec specifies which compression codec to use. Currently, PIG only accepts "gz" and "lzo" as possible values. Since LZO is under GPL license, Hadoop may need to be configured to use LZO codec. Please refer to http://code.google.com/p/hadoop-gpl-compression/wiki/FAQ for details. 

Combining small files:

pig.noSplitCombination - disables combining multiple small files to the block size
