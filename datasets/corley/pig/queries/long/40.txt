1) You should not use finalizers for things other than external resources â€“ using them here is very dangerous and could inadvertantly lead to deadlocks and object resurrection and just decreases performance without any advantage.
2) Using .freeMemory() the way it is used in this class is broken.  freeMemory() is going to return a mostly random number between 0 and the real amount.  Adding gc() in here is a terrible performance burden.  If you really want to do something like this you should using softreferences and finalization queues.
