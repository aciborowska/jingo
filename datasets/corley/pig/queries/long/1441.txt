As we get more and more tests, adding more structure would help us to minimize time spent on testing. Here are 2 new targets I propose we add. (Hadoop has the same targets for the same purposes).

unit - to run all true unit tests (those that trully testing apis and internal functionality and not running e2e tests through junit. This test should run relatively quick 10-15 minutes and if we are good at adding unit tests will give good covergae.
smoke - this would be a set of a few e2e tests that provide good overall coverage within about 30 minutes.

I would say that for simple patche, we would still require only commit tests while for more involved patches, the developers should run both unit and smoke before submitting the patch.
