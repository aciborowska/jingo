In either trunk or branch-0.13 I run ant -Dhadoopversion=23.
Problem seems to be in junit-4.11.jar.
Not sure from where pig or ivy is pulling this corrupt file.
Work around is to copy junit-4.11.jar from maven repo, but this solution doesn't lend itself to automated builds.
Get:
compile:
     [echo] *** Building Main Sources ***
     [echo] *** To compile with all warnings enabled, supply -Dall.warnings=1 on command line ***
     [echo] *** Else, you will only be warned about deprecations ***
