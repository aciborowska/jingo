I have a dataset in HDFS that's stored in a file per column that I'd like to access from pig.  This means I can't use LoadFunc to get at the data as it only allows the loader access to a single input stream at a time.  To handle this usage, I've broken the existing split creation code out into a few classes and interfaces, and allowed user specified load functions to be used in place of the existing code.
