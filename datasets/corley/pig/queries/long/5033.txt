This script produces incorrect results:


a = load 'file:///tmp/input1' as (x:int, y:int);
b = load 'file:///tmp/input2' as (x:int, y:int);
u = union a,b;
c = load 'file:///tmp/input3' as (x:int, y:int);
e = filter c by y > 3;
f = filter c by y < 2;
g = join u by x left, e by x using 'replicated';
h = join g by u::x left, f by x using 'replicated';
store h into 'file:///tmp/pigoutput';



Without the union, or with opt.multiquery=false, or with non-replicated joins, it works as expected.
