There are still a couple of e2e test aborts/failures for hadoop23. Most of them are due to test infrastructure, minor backward incompatibility change in 23, or recent changes in Pig. Here is a list:

Scripting_1/Scripting_2: MAPREDUCE-3700

Native_3: 23 test need a hadoop23-steaming.jar

MonitoredUDF_1: Seems related to guava upgrade (PIG-2460), Pig's guava is newer than hadoop23's

UdfException_1, UdfException_2, UdfException_3, UdfException_4: Error message change

Checkin_2, GroupAggFunc_7, GroupAggFunc_9, GroupAggFunc_12, GroupAggFunc_13, Types_6, Scalar_1: float precision

Limit_2: The specific output records change, test infrastructure should allow this
