PIG-3204 fixed pig script parsing to parse in batches instead of line by line. But the fix in BoundScript is not right and it is still parsing line by line. That makes parsing take long time for very large pig scripts using PigStorage when there is no schema file stored and without -noschema as it tries to find the schema file lots of times.

It should be grunt.parseStopOnError(false); instead of grunt.parseStopOnError(true); to make it parse statements in batch.
