The check-in's so far on load-store-redesign branch have nor addressed unit test failures due to interface changes. This jira is to track the task of making the common case unit tests work with the new interfaces. Some aspects of the new proposal like using LoadCaster interface for casting, making local mode work have not been completed yet. Tests which are failing due to those reasons will not be fixed in this jira and addressed in the jiras corresponding to those tasks
