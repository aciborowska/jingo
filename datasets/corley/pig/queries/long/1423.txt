The relation name in pig script can been considered as variable of programming language. One risk of the current grunt is that user may use the previous defined relation name by typo after a long period of work on grunt. And it is difficult for users to track this problem.  E.g. the following red "students" is not the user intend to use, but here grunt won't throw any error meesage.

students = load 'a.txt';
....
student = load 'b.txt';
result = foreach students generate $0;


The clear command is to clear the variable defined before, then if users use the relation name defined before, grunt will throw error message. And this command also will be useful to let user reuse the relation names especially when he's doing lots of experiments for one specific task.
