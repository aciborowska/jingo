Build process can be faster. Here is the issues slow down the build process:
1. Should change test/org/apache/pig/test/utils/dotGraph/Dot.jjt to DOTParser.jjt. [jjtree] assumes the output file name the same with the input file name, otherwise, it will recompile every time
2. Delete src/org/apache/pig/backend/hadoop/executionengine/physicalLayer/relationalOperators/POPostCombinerPackage.java and src/org/apache/pig/impl/plan/SplitIntroducer.java, both classes are empty and generates no class file. Ant will recompile them every time since it do not see the output class file.

I do not know how to create a patch with file deletion and rename, so I describe the actions below:
1. mv test/org/apache/pig/test/utils/dotGraph/Dot.jjt test/org/apache/pig/test/utils/dotGraph/DOTParser.jjt
2. rm src/org/apache/pig/backend/hadoop/executionengine/physicalLayer/relationalOperators/POPostCombinerPackage.java
3. rm src/org/apache/pig/impl/plan/SplitIntroducer.java
4. apply patch to change build.xml (Dot.jjt -> DOTParser.jjt)
