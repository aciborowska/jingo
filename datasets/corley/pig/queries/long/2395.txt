For some scripts Pig doesn't do early projection, e.g. dropping non-necessary fields as soon as possible. This is observed in two ways: 1) the output doesn't contain INFO like "ColumnPruneVisitor - Columns pruned for xxx: $0, $1"; 2) the job has as much or more local IO (see FILE_BYTES_READ and FILE_BYTES_WRITTEN) as HDFS IO (see HDFS_BYTES_READ).

One example where Pig should figure out A's fields c~n can be dropped before the COGROUP.

A = load '/tmp/A' USING PigStorage('|') as (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n);
B = load '/tmp/B' USING PigStorage('|') as (a);
COG = cogroup A by a, B by a;
out = foreach COG generate SUM(A.b) as sum;
store out into '/tmp/out' USING PigStorage('|');

Another similar example involves a GROUP operator.

While Pig is able and assumed to do early projection in most cases, this inconsistency hurts the performance badly.
