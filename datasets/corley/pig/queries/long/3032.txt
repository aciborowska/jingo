I have attached a reasonable test (IMHO) to add to TestBinInterSedes that shows a fairly obvious case where our serialization of DateTime objects fails. It is not really an issue w/our serialization, per se, but I think what is happening is that since we're serialization the TimeZone and not the Chronology, daylight saving time is throwing it off. I think serializing the Chronology is the way to go.
