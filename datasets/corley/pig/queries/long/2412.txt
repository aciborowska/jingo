Scripting_*, Native_* e2e tests fails for 0.23. The reason is mostly the way we test it.

Scripting:
register "./libexec/python/scriptingudf.py" stop working in 23 since the change of layout of hadoop working directory. register "libexec/python/scriptingudf.py" works. This will cause some backward compatibility issue and we need to document it.

Native:
We need to use right version of "hadoop-example.jar" when test against 23.
