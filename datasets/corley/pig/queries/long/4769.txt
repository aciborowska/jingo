 1) For a script that needs store vertex group removed and merged into split, it gives error

Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: VertexGroup must have at least 2 members

as we leave the vertexgroup with just one member in it (POSplit).

2)  For a script that needs non-store vertex group removed, it gives error

Input from vertex scope-xxx is missing

In this case, vertex group is removed but successor inputs are not replaced correctly.
