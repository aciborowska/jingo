Pig assumes bytearray as the default data type. When using the DBStorage class with MySQL with no data type specified, it works correctly for UTF8 strings. We pass encoding parameters in the connection string to DBStorage. So, DBStorage honours those parameters and values are stored correctly into the tables.

When using DBStorage with PostgreSQL, the same scenario stores UTF8 data in octal format in the tables. Hindi characters or rather all UTF8 characters are stored as "\347......." Also, none of the PostgreSQL connection parameters are honoured.
