pig.script.submitted.timestamp is set in MapReduceLauncher.launchPig() when the a MR plan is launched. Some scripts (i.e. those with an exec in the middle) will cause multiple plans to be launched. In these case jobs launched from the same script can have different pig.script.submitted.timestamp values, which is a bug.
