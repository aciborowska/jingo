Algebraic are functions that can be computed incrementally like count(X), SUM(X), etc. They can be computed effciently by doing the first level computation using hadoop combiner. This can give a significant (2-3x) speedup for many aggregation queries. 

Several users asked us for this feature so it is pretty high priority.
