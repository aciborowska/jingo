The "sh" command in grunt is very sensitive to the behavior of exec.  It requires that you provide an executable filename as the first argument, and those are sort of up for interpretation from platform to platform.  For this to easily handle batch scripts, built-in commands, and executables with one semantic, it should spin up an intermediate command-shell.  This would translate "sh <command>" into "exec("sh" ["-c", <command>])".  This helps to smooth out some of the operating system differences between Windows and Linux, and also improves usability of grunt as a whole.
