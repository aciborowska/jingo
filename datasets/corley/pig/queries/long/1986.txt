.eclipse.templates/.classpath needs to be updated to address following -
1. new jars, jars that moved from lib/ to build/ivy/lib/Pig .
2. test/e2e dir- test/e2e/pig/udfs/java needs to be added as top level dir so that dir structure matches package name.

I am also making a change to TOMAP.java in e2e dir , to add a package name that matches the dir structure.
