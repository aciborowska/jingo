Currently, the values for the replicated side of the data are placed in a spillable bag (POFRJoin near line 275). This does not make sense because the whole point of the optimization is that the data on one side fits into memory. We already have a non-spillable bag implemented (NonSpillableDataBag.java) and we need to change FRJoin code to use it. And of course need to do lots of testing to make sure that we don't spill but die instead when we run out of memory
