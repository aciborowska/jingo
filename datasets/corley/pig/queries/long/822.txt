There is no formal specification of the flatten keyword in http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/docs/r0.2.0/piglatin.html 
There are only some examples.

I have found flatten to be very fragile and unpredictable with the data types it reads and creates. 

Please document:
Flatten to be explained formally in its own dedicated section: What are the valid input types, the output types it creates, what transformation it does from input to output and how the resulting data are named.
