When writing a custom StoreFunc or LoadFunc, setUDFContextSignature is never called or it is called with a null value.  For functions that rely on a valid signature, this results in broken functionality (for instance, can not store the schema between frontend and backend if you use signature.schema as the UDFContext key).
