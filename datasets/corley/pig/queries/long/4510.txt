dataset A is loaded with PigStorage. Then after one filter statement, get B. Then one foreach statement, the result set C is empty. Later use of C would show C is empty depending on what operations may apply on B. 

A = load '$input' using PigStorage('\t', '-schema');
B = filter A by (something);
C = foreach B generate some_field, some_field*some_field; 

then C is empty unless additional operation is made on B.
