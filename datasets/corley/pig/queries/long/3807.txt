The following script fails:

d1 = load 'test_data.txt' USING PigStorage() AS (f1: int, f2: int, f3: int, f4: int);
d2 = load 'test_data.txt' USING PigStorage() AS (f1: int, f2: int, f3: int, f4: int);
– the sorting causes the error
n1 = foreach (group d1 by f1) {
	sorted = ORDER d1 by f2;
	generate group, flatten(d1.f3) as x3;
};
n2 = foreach (group d2 by f1) {
	sorted = ORDER d2 by f2;
	generate group, flatten(d2.f3) as q3;
};
describe n1;
describe n2;

joined = join n1 by (x3), n2 by (q3);
describe joined;
final = foreach joined generate n1::x3;
dump final;

– selected output below
n1: 
{group: int,x3: int}
n2: 
{group: int,q3: int}
joined: 
{n1::group: int,n1::x3: int,n2::group: int,n2::q3: int}
