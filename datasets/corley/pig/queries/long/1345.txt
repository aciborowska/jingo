For the purpose of easy debugging, I would be nice to find out where  my warnings are coming from is in the pig script. 

The only known process is to comment out lines in the Pig script and see if these warnings go away.

2010-01-13 21:34:13,697 [main] WARN  org.apache.pig.PigServer - Encountered Warning IMPLICIT_CAST_TO_MAP 2 time(s) line 22 
2010-01-13 21:34:13,698 [main] WARN  org.apache.pig.PigServer - Encountered Warning IMPLICIT_CAST_TO_LONG 2 time(s) line 23
2010-01-13 21:34:13,698 [main] WARN  org.apache.pig.PigServer - Encountered Warning IMPLICIT_CAST_TO_BAG 1 time(s). line 26

I think this may need us to keep track of the line numbers of the Pig script (via out javacc parser) and maintain it in the logical and physical plan.

It would help users in debugging simple errors/warning related to casting.

Is this enhancement listed in the  http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigJournal?

Do we need to change the parser to something other than javacc to make this task simpler?
