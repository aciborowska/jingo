I've implemented a UDF in Pig 0.5 that implements Algebraic and calculates variance in a distributed manner, based on the AVG() builtin.  It works by calculating the count, sum and sum of squares, as described here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Parallel_algorithm

Is this a worthwhile contribution?  Taking the square root of this value using the contrib SQRT() function gives Standard Deviation, which is missing from Pig.
