Attached  simpleTest.out. It seems like HDFS counter 'HDFS_BYTES_WRITTEN' returns the byte count not only for the result of pig store operator, but it includes the size of the jar files as well. The problem is this could change very easily, so in my opinion the best would be to remove these assertions from TestPigRunner as this is just causing intermittent and/or persistent failures.
The test class is for basic testing of PigRunner, and this is achieved well enough without the asserts.
