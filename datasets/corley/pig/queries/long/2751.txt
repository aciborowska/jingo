I would like to be able to use macros within the GENERATE of an FOREACH.

Example:


define test_macro(param1, param2) returns ret_val {
  $ret_val = (param1 == 0 ? param2 : param1);
};

a = LOAD ('data') AS (id, val1, val2);

b = FOREACH a GENERATE id, test_macro(val1, val2);

DUMP b;



This would be most useful for having only a single point to edit (the macro) if a definition for a special computation changes. Lets say, you have raw log data and several scripts loading it. All scripts need to filter out specific unused columns. Most (but not all) of the scripts are dealing with a field that needs to be handled in a special way. So I cannot just use two different LOAD functions (one with the special computation and one without) because that would make a second FOREACH ... GENERATE necessary to filter out the unused columns.
