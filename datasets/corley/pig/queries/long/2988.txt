right now the Pig project doesn't publish pigunit Maven artifact, thins like

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.pig</groupId>
  <artifactId>pigunit</artifactId>
  <version>0.10.0</version>
</dependency>


doesn't work. Can we start deploy pigunit Maven artifacts as part of the release process? Thanks.
