We've noticed that when we generate couple of sub-directories with Oozie and then use AvroStorage (the older version from PiggyBank) to load those directories, hidden files such as _SUCCESS won't get ignored as they should be and in turn will cause failures in the Pig job. This seems to be regression caused by PIG-3223.
