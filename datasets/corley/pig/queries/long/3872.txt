If I am attempting to write to an HDFS location that I'm not authorized to, Hadoop throws an AccessControlException. However, this can happen at the fag end of a long Pig job, leading to a lot of wasted computation.

It'd be nicer if Pig can instead check for access control permissions either when doing a syntax check, or if it's an actual run, check for this at the start and fail fast.
