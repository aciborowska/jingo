When looking at PIG-3385, noticed some issues in handling of custom partitioner with multi-query optimization.


C1 = group B1 by col1 PARTITION BY
       org.apache.pig.test.utils.SimpleCustomPartitioner parallel 2;
C2 = group B2 by col1 PARTITION BY
       org.apache.pig.test.utils.SimpleCustomPartitioner parallel 2;


This seems to be merged to one mapreduce job correctly but custom partitioner information was lost.


C1 = group B1 by col1 PARTITION BY org.apache.pig.test.utils.SimpleCustomPartitioner parallel 2;
C2 = group B2 by col1 parallel 2;


This seems to be merged even though they should run on two different partitioner.
