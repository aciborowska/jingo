In ResourceStatistics.java we see mBytes is public, and has a public getter/setter.


47	    public Long mBytes; // size in megabytes

196	    public Long getmBytes() {
197	        return mBytes;
198	    }
199	    public ResourceStatistics setmBytes(Long mBytes) {
200	        this.mBytes = mBytes;
201	        return this;
202	    }



Typically sizes are stored as bytes, potentially having convenience functions to return with different units.

If mBytes can be marked private without causing woes it might be worth storing size as bytes instead.
