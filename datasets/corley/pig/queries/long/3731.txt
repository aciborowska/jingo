This could be done in several ways, however, adding a namespace (pig.local.) for this is better so that only a few number of jobs that require this can make use of it.

set pig.local.io.sort.mb 50 will set io.sort.mb=50 for local mode jobs allowing many jobs to run in parallel. Another setting that might be required is - io.compression.codecs.
