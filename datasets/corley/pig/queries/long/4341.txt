Pig has supported compression(GZ, GZIP, LZO). But latest pig has not supported CMX codec yet. cmx is "com.ibm.biginsights.compress.CmxCodec". This information also could be found from latest release pig-0.13.0 documentation: http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.13.0/perf.html. 
Besides, I once tested CMX codec with pig-0.13.0 before. Following was the current settings:
SET pig.tmpfilecompression true;
SET pig.tmpfilecompression.codec cmx;
Error:
Caused by: java.io.IOException: Invalid temporary file compression codec [cmx]. Expected compression codecs for org.apache.pig.impl.io.TFileStorage are GZ,GZIP,LZO.
