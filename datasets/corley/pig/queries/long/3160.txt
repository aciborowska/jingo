The GFCross UDF contains the following code:


int[] digits = new int[numInputs];
for (int i=0; i<numInputs; i++){
  if (i == myNumber){
    digits[i] = r.nextInt(numGroupsPerInput);
  }else{
    digits[i] = 0;
 }
}



As int arrays are initialized with all 0s already, this is equivalent to just settings digits[myNumber] and leaving the rest alone.
