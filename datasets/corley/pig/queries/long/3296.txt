several people mentioned this in last Pig meetup. The objective is enabling us to run whole unit tests before commit any patch. The fix should include two parts:

(1) unit test doesn't interferes each other (e.g. moving test dir from /tmp to build/test/tmp so test doesn't delete other test's dir)
(2) need to make sure Pig is thread safe

this is a candidate project for Google summer of code 2013
