We find ourselves wrapping StoreFuncs often and have written a StoreFuncDecorator and a StoreMetadataDecorator class. These make it easy to subclass and decorate only select StoreFuncs methods.

This is conceptually similar to the wrapper helpers in the Java servlet API: 
http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequestWrapper.html
http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/servlet/ServletResponseWrapper.html

I think these would make useful additions to Pig.
