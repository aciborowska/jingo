Adds load/store functions for fixed width data to the Piggybank. They use the syntax of the unix "cut" command to specify column positions, and have an option to skip the header row when loading or to write a header row when storing.

The header handling works properly with multiple small files each with a header being combined into one split, or a large file with a single header being split into multiple splits.
