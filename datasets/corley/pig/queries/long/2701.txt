As Pig becomes more customizable (PPNLs, ReducerEstimators, Optimizers?), the current approach of loading custom classes via class params and reflection can become clunky. This is especially true when trying to integrate a complex object graph into Pig.

This JIRA is to explore how using Guice (http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/) for IoC can help.

Here's a proof of concept developed during the hackathon:

Let me know what you think of the approach. There are other use cases where this can be helpful that I'm less familiar with, so it would be great to identify holes in the approach if you see them.
