When a udf has a project-star or project-range-to-end (eg- $3 ..)as the argument, then to find the appropriate matching udf class, pig type checker (TypeCheckingRelVisitor) creates a UDF input schema that has a single tuple as the argument. But at runtime, the udf will actually get an input that has the expanded list of columns - not a tuple containing a single tuple as indicated by schema used in typechecking.

The patch in PIG-1938 has fix for the case where input schema is present, as it expands the project-star or project-range in that case. Project-range is expanded even in input schema is not present, if it is not a project-to-end, as the number of columns present in such cases is known.
