The following script fails launching a class cast exception:
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to org.apache.pig.data.DataBag


a = LOAD 'a.txt' as (line:chararray);
b = GROUP a ALL;
c = FOREACH b GENERATE COUNT(*) AS sum;
DUMP c;




However, this other script works correctly:

a = LOAD 'a.txt' as (line:chararray);
b = GROUP a ALL;
c = FOREACH b GENERATE COUNT(*) AS sum;
d = ORDER a BY $0;
DUMP d;


So I assume there is something strange in the DUMP operator.
