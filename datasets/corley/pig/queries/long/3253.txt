While reviewing the patch for PIG-3141, I noticed that the following comment is out-of-date:
PigSplit.java
// package level access because we don't want LoadFunc implementations
// to get this information - this is to be used only from
// MergeJoinIndexer
public int getSplitIndex() {
    return splitIndex;
}


Looking at the commit history, the public qualifier was added by PIG-1309, but the comment wasn't updated accordingly.

Provided that more and more LoadFunc implementations use this method (e.g. PIG-3141), we should remove this misleading comment to avoid any confusion.
