Currently Pig reads records off of the reduce iterator and immediately deserializes them into Java objects.  This takes up much more memory than serialized versions, thus Pig spills sooner then if it stored them in serialized form.  Also, if it does have to spill, it has to serialize them again, and then again deserialize them after reading from the spill file.

We should explore storing them in memory serialized when they are read off of the reduce iterator.
