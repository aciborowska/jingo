PigContext's scriptJars should handle de-duplication of jars to account for script engines e.g. JythonScriptEngine performing various jar loading for module and sometimes adding same jar twice. AlsoJobControlCompiler.shipToHdfs() needs a check against adding the same jar more than once, under different randomly incremented sub-dirs.
