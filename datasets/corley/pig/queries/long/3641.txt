Our user was observing incorrect outputs depending on if the query had intermediate output or not.  Below is a simplified testcase I came up with.


knoguchi pig> cat test.txt
9,1,ignored
9,1,ignored
9,1,ignored
knoguchi pig> cat bz-6590644/test.pig
A = load 'test.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (a1:int, a2:int, a3:chararray);
B = foreach A generate a1,a2;
SPLIT B into C1 if a2 == 1, D1 otherwise;
C2 = foreach C1 generate a2;
store C2 into '/tmp/testC';
store D1 into '/tmp/testD';

Incorrect output shown below.  /tmp/testD should be empty but somehow has data in it.


knoguchi@nameother-lm pig> cat /tmp/testC/part-m-00000

knoguchi pig> cat /tmp/testD/part-m-00000
