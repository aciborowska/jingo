As stated in the docs, rewriting an inner join and filtering nulls from inputs can be a big performance gain: http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.14.0/perf.html#nulls

We would like to add an optimizer rule which detects inner joins, and filters nulls in all inputs:
A = filter A by t is not null;
B = filter B by x is not null;
C = join A by t, B by x;
