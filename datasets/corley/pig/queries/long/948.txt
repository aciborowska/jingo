Currently its hard to find a way to relate pig script with specific MR job. In a loaded cluster with multiple simultaneous job submissions, its not easy to figure out which specific MR jobs were launched for a given pig script. If Pig can provide this info, it will be useful to debug and monitor the jobs resulting from a pig script.

At the very least, Pig should be able to provide user the following information
1) Job id of the launched job.
2) Complete web url of jobtracker running this job.
