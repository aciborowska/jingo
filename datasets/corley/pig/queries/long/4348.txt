 Currently Tez AM size is increased upto 4G automatically based on total number of tasks.  Also need to take into account a lot of other factors like vertices, number of shuffle edges possible, etc. 

 A job with 17390 tasks for which memory was increased to 2G and container size to 2.5G still failed with OOM as it had 38 vertices.
