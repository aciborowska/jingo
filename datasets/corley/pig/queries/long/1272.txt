For a simple script the column pruner optimization removes certain columns from the original relation, which results in wrong results.

Input file "kv" contains the following columns (tab separated)

a       1
a       2
a       3
b       4
c       5
c       6
b       7
d       8



Now running this script in Pig 0.6 produces


kv = load 'kv' as (k,v);
keys= foreach kv generate k;
keys = distinct keys; 
keys = limit keys 2;
rejoin = join keys by k, kv by k;
dump rejoin;



(a,a)
(a,a)
(a,a)
(b,b)
(b,b)


Running this in Pig 0.5 version without column pruner results in:
(a,a,1)
(a,a,2)
(a,a,3)
(b,b,4)
(b,b,7)

When we disable the "ColumnPruner" optimization it gives right results.
