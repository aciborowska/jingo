As a byproduct of how ANTLR lexes things, whenever we introduce a new operator (RANK, CUBE, and any special keyword really) we are implicitly introducing a reserved word that can't be used for relations, columns, etc (unless give to us by the framework, as in the case of group).

The following, for example, fails:


a = load 'foo' as (x:int);
a = foreach a generate x as rank;



I'll include a patch to fix this essentially by whitelisting tokens. I currently just whitelist cube, rank, and group. We can add more as people want them? Can anyone think of reasonable ones they'd like to add?
