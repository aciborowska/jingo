Initially proactive spill bags were designed for use in (co)group (InternalCacheBag) and they knew the total number of proactive bags that were present, and shared the memory limit specified using the property pig.cachedbag.memusage .
But the two proactive bag implementations were added later - InternalDistinctBag and InternalSortedBag are not aware of actual number of bags being used - their users always assume total-numbags = 3. 

This needs to be fixed and all proactive-spill bags should share the memory-limit .
