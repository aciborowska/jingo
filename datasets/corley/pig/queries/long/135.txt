Let's assume SRC_TOP is the top-level src directory.

Currently the build process creates a src-gen directory in SRC_TOP and the junit tests create dfs and test directories in SRC_TOP. This means that the 'ant clean' task now has to cleanup all of them.

Interestingly, 'ant clean' doesn't remove the 'dfs' directory at all... a related bug.

It would be nice to create a standalone build directory in the top-level directory and then use that as the parent of all generated files (source and non-source). This would mean 'ant clean' would just need to delete the build directory. It plays well when there are multiple sub-projects developed on top of Pig (e.g. contrib etc.) too.
