I am trying to load some resources in my UDF using MyClass.getClassLoader().getResources("myResource"). I have a bunch of different files called "myResource" which are scattered across my library files. In a non-Pig invocation, the above method returns an Enumeration containing all the resource files called "myResource". When I call this from a UDF, I can see only that the returned Enumeration only contains a single "myResource". It looks like Pig's JarManager is combining all the jar's in the class path into a single jar and the last entry wins. This kind of code and resource layout is used for loading resource bundles in i18n/l10n. In my opinion, at the very least, Pig shouldn't merge out resource files without a warning. Also why should jar files have to be merged like that? Can they not be added to Hadoop's distributed cache individually?
