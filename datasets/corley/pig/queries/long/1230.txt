Last table of join statement is streamed through instead of collecting all its tuple in a bag. As a further optimization of that, tuples of that relation are collected in chunks in a bag. Since we don't want to spill the tuples from this bag, NonSpillableBag should be used to hold tuples for this relation. Initially, DefaultDataBag was used, which was later changed to InternalCachedBag as a part of PIG-1209.
