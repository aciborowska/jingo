ISO-8601 standardizes text representation of dates and times. 
Strict ISO-8601 requires a 'T' between the date and time portion. 
ISO-8601 allows a ' ' space as a variant. 
JDBC uses a ' ' space between the date and time portion. 
Hive (& Impala) adopt the JDBC ' ' space variant. 

The pig built-in UDF ToDateISO(chararray) currently accepts only the strict 'T' format. This makes it difficult to integrate with data from JDBC sources, including Hive. 

ToDateISO(chararray) should allow either the 'T' or ' ' space variant when parsing string representations of datetime primitives.
