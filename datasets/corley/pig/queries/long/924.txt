The current Pig build scripts package hadoop and other dependencies into the pig.jar file.
This means that if users upgrade Hadoop, they also need to upgrade Pig.

Pig has relatively few dependencies on Hadoop interfaces that changed between 18, 19, and 20.  It is possibly to write a dynamic shim that allows Pig to use the correct calls for any of the above versions of Hadoop. Unfortunately, the building process precludes us from the ability to do this at runtime, and forces an unnecessary Pig rebuild even if dynamic shims are created.
