If parameter value is generated via a command, it would fail for some commands. Example:

%declare cmd `/usr/local/bin/perl -e 'print "studenttab10k"'`

This command fails because currently the command is executed via call to Runtime.exec(cmd). In this case, default tokenizer is used to split the command and it does not respect the quotes.
