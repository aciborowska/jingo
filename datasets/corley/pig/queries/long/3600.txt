To reproduce the error, run the command-

ant clean test -Dtestcase=TestExampleGenerator -Dexectype=mr -Dhadoopversion=20



Right now, illustrator isn't fully fixed after the POPackage refactoring (PIG-3595), and the test fails because of that. We need to fix this before commit the POPackage refactoring into trunk.
