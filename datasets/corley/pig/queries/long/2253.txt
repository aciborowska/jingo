The pig shell script has a -config option like hadoop. However it does not, because the "secretDebugCmd" option makes a copy of the arguments and places it in a variable called "remaining". This means "config /my/config/directory" is passed to the Java class org.apache.pig.Main. The class does not recognize the "-config" option so instead of grunt starting it prints the usage message and exits.
