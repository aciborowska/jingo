In 0.8 documentation ,http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.8.0/piglatin_ref2.html#Flatten+Operator
the behavior of flatten for empty bags is well documented. 


Also note that the flatten of empty bag will result in that row being discarded; no output is generated.



Since this is applicable for Pig 0.7 also, the same should be documented in :
http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.7.0/piglatin_ref2.html#Flatten+Operator
