I was trying to load an empty avro folder using the this command,

records = LOAD 'examples/input/'
          USING org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.avro.AvroStorage(
            'no_schema_check',
            'schema_file', 'hdfs://namenode01:8020/schema/twitter.avsc');

even after i mentioned "no_schema_check" it is still looking for schema and throwing an error saying "Cannot get avro schema! Input path might be empty"
