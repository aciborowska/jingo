These are zebra compression related issues:
1. ColumnGoupParser only recognize "gzip" not "gz". For example, if user specify "compress by gz", it will throw org.apache.hadoop.zebra.types.ParseException.

2. BasicTable.dumpInfo is wrong. It will always print "Compressor: lzo2" even if the default compressor is "gz", or user specifies "compress by gzip".
So we can not verify if the default compressor can be actually  over written.
