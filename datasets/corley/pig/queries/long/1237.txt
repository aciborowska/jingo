I've made a modification to the piggy bank MutliStorage class that allows to optionally specify the index of the field in each tuple to write to output.
This feature allows to have records with metadata like seqno, time of upload etc, and then to combine files from these records into one but without the metadata.
e.g. 
1: date type seq1 data
2:  date type seq2 data

then write output grouped by type and ordered by sequence:
data
data
