In HCatalog, i am using hive table and doing transformation and after completing the transformation i want to overwrite the data back to the same hive table.however, while writing back the data to the same table, the transformed data is getting appended rather not getting overwrite.
It would be good if we have option like overwrite so that if need we can use overwrite or append as we have this kind of feature in hive while importing the data into a hive table.
