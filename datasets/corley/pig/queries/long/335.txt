Given a script like:

A = load 'bla' as (x, y) using Loader1();
B = load 'morebla' as (s, t) using Loader2();
C = cogroup A by x, B by s;
D = foreach C generate flatten(A), flatten(B);
E = foreach D generate x, y, t + 1;

In this case, in the last foreach, a cast will need to be added to t + 1 to allow t (a byte array) to be added to an integer.  We use load functions to handle this late casting.  The issue is that we do not currently have a way to know whether to use Loader1 or Loader2 to cast the data.  We need to track the lineage of fields so that the cast operator can select the correct loader.
