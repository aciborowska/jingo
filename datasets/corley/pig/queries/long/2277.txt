Currently Pig depends on hadoop 0.20.
While it is relatively easy to pass a property to the build (through -D or through build.properties) to set hadoop-core.version to something else, the problem is that since hadoop 0.22 the project has been split.
No longer is there one single hadoop-core jar to build against.
