Currently, when we use load udfs, we have to use "register" statement. It is ideal that if user put udf jars in classpath, we can omit register statement, Pig can pick the udf from classpath automatically.

However, Pig do not ship load udfs currently, the classpath approach does not work. "register" works because Pig ship that entire jar. Pig do ship eval udfs and storage udfs, we should ship load udfs as well.
