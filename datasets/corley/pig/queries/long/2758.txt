Support for Map's is not consistent in the builtin evalfunc/impl. There might be other inconsistencies too (like BIGCHARARRAY, but I have not investigated).

For example: search for Long.class or Long.TYPE - this gives us the list of classes/usecases where "Map" is not supported the same way .. Invoker, MonitoredUDFExecutor.

This is NOT a principled way to find all instances of this sort of buggy behavior - someone with better knowledge of pig internals (DataType's, other langs, checks, etc) can do a better job.
