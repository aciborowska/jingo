The following queries do not work:

Nested filter:

a = load 'studenttab10k' as (name, age, gpa);
b = filter a by age < 20;
c = group b by age;
d = foreach c 
{ cf = filter b by gpa < 3.0; cp = cf.gpa; cd = distinct cp; co = order cd by $0; generate group, flatten(co); }
store d into 'output';

Nested Distinct:

a = load '/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k' as (name, age, gpa);
b = group a by name;
c = foreach b 
{ aa = distinct a.age; generate group, COUNT(aa); }
store c into 'output';
