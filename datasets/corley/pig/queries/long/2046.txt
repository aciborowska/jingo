The properties which are set through 'SET' commands are not passed through to FS commands.

Ex;
SET dfs.umaskmode '026'
fs -touchz umasktest/file0

It looks like the SET commands are processed by GruntParser after the FsShell creation happens with current set of properties. Hence whatever properties defined in SET will not be reflected for fs commands executed in the script.
