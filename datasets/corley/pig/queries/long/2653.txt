Based on the size of the PIG script, it takes 1 or 2 minutes in certain cases for PIG compiler to create the MR plan. If the same script has to be run later point in time, it has to go through this process again. 

It would be nice, if PIG can store the result (execution plan) which can be reused when the same script is run again.
