when specifying an aliasOverride in registerScript, pig does not replace the override unless there's a space character after it. 

GruntParser:77 =
      if (query.toLowerCase().startsWith(alias.getKey().toLowerCase() + " ")) {

This makes it impossible to make cool uses of this feature, such as removing custom calls to macros. E.g. if I have a macro called store_only_in_debug_mode, and I want to override it and ignore it in production, it would have been nice if I could just add "store_only_in_debug_mode" to my override list. Currently, this will only work if the script has a space char after the macro call. E.g. 

store_only_in_debug_mode (my_alias);    <--- works

store_only_in_debug_mode(my_alias);    <--- doesn't work, sad
