The following script produce wrong result:

test1.dat:
1
2
3

test2.dat:
1
2

pig script:

a = LOAD 'test1.dat' USING PigStorage() AS (d1:int);
b = LOAD 'test2.dat' USING PigStorage() AS (d2:int);
c = JOIN a BY d1 FULL OUTER, b BY d2;
d = FILTER c BY d2 IS NULL;
STORE d INTO 'test.out' USING PigStorage();



expected:
3

We get:
1
2
3

This is because we erroneously push the filter before full outer join. Similar issue is addressed in PIG-1289, but we only fix left/right outer join.
