Believe the spark branch will be shortly ready to be merged with the main branch (couple of minor patches pending commit), given that we have addressed most functionality gaps and have ensured the UTs are clean. There are a few optimizations which we will take up once the branch is merged to trunk.

Xuefu Zhang, Rohini Palaniswamy, Daniel Dai,
Hopefully, you agree that the spark branch is ready for merge. If yes, how would like us to go about it? Do you want me to upload a huge patch that will be merged like any other patch or do you prefer a branch merge?
