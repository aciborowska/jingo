I'd like to be able to pass a reference to an item within a parameter to a Pig Macro.

For example, suppose that I had a relation A with the schema A:
{id:long, header:(time:long, type:chararray)}
. I'd like to call a macro by typing:

   B = MY_MACRO(A, header.time);

but this does not currently work. Obviously, I could define a new relation as a workaround, for example I could use some pig code like 

  AA = FOREACH a GENERATE *, header.time as time;
  B = MY_MACRO(AA, time);

But that's ugly and clunky
