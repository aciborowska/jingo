From my point of view a test suite is very important for a open source project. As better and easier to use it is, as more people can easy contribute and fix bugs. 
With this in mind I see some space for improvement in the test suite for pig. Here my suggestions, I would love to work on that in case we all agree on the points.

Phase 1:
+ it should be possible to switch a test mode that defines if pig runs in local mode, mini cluster or big cluster.
++ ant test -Dtest.mode=local or -Dtest.mode=mapreduce or -Dtest.mode=mapreduce -Dcluster=myJobTracker
++ default should be local

Phase 2:
+ setup a hudson ci build, run minicluster once a day, run local mode after each checkin.

Phase 3:
cleanup the test package, general standard is that each test should be in the same package as the class that is tested.
