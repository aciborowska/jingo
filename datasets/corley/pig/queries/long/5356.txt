Create a keyword that would allow the programmer to tell PIG that a particular DISTINCT/GROUP BY action should disable the combiner.

 

Often we have pieces of code to ensure that data is meeting expectations, even if we are pretty sure it already is. One example, is when we do a DISTINCT on data to ensure we do not have duplicates or we re-GROUP data to a certain grain before a join. In these cases, the combiner is taking extra time, but not actually giving us a benefit. We can gain significant performance improvement in this cases if the combiner is simply not run. In some cases we can do this at the job level, but in others, we may only want to have the combiner shut off for particular statements.
