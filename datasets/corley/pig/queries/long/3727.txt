The e2e SkewedJoin_6 test runs the following query-

a = load ':INPATH:/singlefile/studenttab10k';
b = filter a by $1 > 25;
c = join a by $0, b by $0 using 'skewed' parallel 7;
store c into ':OUTPATH:';


Currently, this fails with a compilation error in TezCompiler. Basically, visitSkewedJoin() doesn't handle the POSplit that is inserted between load and join.
