A pig's datatype can map to more than one hive/ORC datatype. This is easily handled while loading where we map the multiple hive datatypes to one datatype but while storing it defaults to one hive datatype.

Have options to store a

	pig's int data type as BYTE or SHORT  instead of INT. There is also TINYINT and SMALLINT
	pig's chararray data type as hive CHAR or VARCHAR instead of STRING
	pig's datetime data type as DATE instead of TIMESTAMP
