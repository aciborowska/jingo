All samples with 'extends EvalFunc' have syntax errors in http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/docs/r0.3.0/udf.html .
There shouldn't be parentheses; they are angle brackets.

For example in "How to Write a Simple Eval Function" section:

  public class UPPER extends EvalFunc (String)

should be 

  public class UPPER extends EvalFunc<String>
