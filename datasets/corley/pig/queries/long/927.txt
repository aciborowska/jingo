Currenlty Pig mostly follows SQL semantics for handling null. However there are certain cases where pig may need to handle nulls correctly. One example is the join - joins on single keys results in null keys not matching to produce an output. However if the join is on >1 keys, in the key tuple, if one of the values is null, it still matches with another key tuple which has a null for that value. We need to decide the right semantics here.
