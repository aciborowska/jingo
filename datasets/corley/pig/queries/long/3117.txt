when we debug our pig jobs on pre-production data, we usually find bugs we couldn't detect in our UT, as env and data are not quite the same.

when the final output of a script is not quite what we expect, we start divide-and-conquer, running it line by line and inspecting the intermediate output of each stage. 

It would be great if we could simply configure pig not to delete the intermediate MR outputs, and store them as plaintext instead of snappy format.
