Hi There,

How can I use counter to count the total #of records processed through pig script. 
I know that it can be achieved by writing & invoking a UDF from pig script or by using GROUPBY & COUNT(), but here I don't want to go this way.

I need the way in PIG like the way we are accessing the counter as 
context.getCounter(MyCounters.Counter).increment(1);
