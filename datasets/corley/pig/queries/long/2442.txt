Hi,

If there are multiple store in a pig streaming script, it goes into infinite waiting. 

Script

DEFINE SCRIPT `./a.pl` SHIP ('/homes/anithar/a.pl');;
DEFINE SCRIPT1 `./b.pl` SHIP ('/homes/anithar/b.pl');;
A = LOAD 'test.txt' USING PigStorage() ;
B1 = STREAM A THROUGH SCRIPT ;
B1 = foreach B1 generate $0;
STORE B1 INTO 'B1' USING PigStorage();
B2 =  STREAM B1 THROUGH SCRIPT1;
STORE B2 INTO 'B2' USING PigStorage();



a.pl
--------
#! /usr/bin/perl -w
while (my $line = <STDIN>) {
        print uc($line);
}
--------

b.pl
---------
#! /usr/bin/perl -w
while (my $line = <STDIN>) 
{
        print $line;
}
---------

Input (test.txt)
{code}
test
hi
hello




This infinite waiting happens randomly causing the job to fail with "Task attempt failed to report
status for 605 seconds. Killing!". 
Same happens with 0.8 version too.
