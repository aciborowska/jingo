Execution of Pig script

A = LOAD 'input.txt';
B = RANK A;
STORE B INTO 'output1.txt';
STORE A INTO 'output2.txt';


crashes with 

[main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 2017: Internal error creating job configuration.


If "STORE A INTO 'output2.txt'" is removed, the script works fine. Content of 'input.txt' does not seem to matter much, except it cannot be empty (apparently triggers bug PIG-3726).
