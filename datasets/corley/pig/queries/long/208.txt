Pig files are kept in externalized form between Pig programs, but (I believe) are held in internalized form while being used. It is expensive to internalize externalized files at the beginning of each program, and to externalize internalized files at the end of each program. Pig needs a way to keep its files internalized across programs. This will require a way to name and manage internalized files.
