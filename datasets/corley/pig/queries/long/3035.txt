With latest version of hadoop, the job failure shown to user is always Container killed by the ApplicationMaster. For eg: 

"Backend error : Unable to recreate exception from backed error: AttemptID:attempt_1352163563357_0002_m_000000_1 Info:Container killed by the ApplicationMaster"


Steps to Reproduce:
  Change hadoop version from 2.0.0-alpha to 0.23.5-SNAPSHOT in ivy/libraries.properties. Tests TestScalarAliases.testScalarErrMultipleRowsInInput and TestEvalPipeline2.testNonStandardData will fail when run with -Dhadoopversion=23.
