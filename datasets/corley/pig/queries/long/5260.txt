   Currently bloom join allows specifying the number of bloom filters and all of them are broadcast to each join vertex. The bloom filter partition logic is joinkey hashcode % num_filters. The reducer partition logic is joinkey hashcode % num_reducers. If we made the number of bloom filters equal to number of reducers in the join we can just broadcast bloom filter  0 to reducer 0, bloom filter 1 to reducer 1 and so on. one-one edge will most likely prevent auto-reduce parallelism from being applied for the scatter-gather edge. So need to see if we need a custom one-one broadcast edge for this.
