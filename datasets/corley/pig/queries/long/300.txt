I am working on a Load Function that allows to specify any Hadoop FileInputFormat or CompositeInputFormat.

Because of the nature of PigSlice and PigSlicer such a UDF needs to use a different implementation of Slice and Slicer.

It turns out that it would be extremely helpful if the SliceWrapper class had a couple of minor changes:

1) an additional get method to return the 'wrapped' slice.
2) change to getLocations method to just call the getLocations() method of the wrapped Slice, unless 'wrapped' is a PigSlice (in which case it just does what it does now).

I will make a patch available shortly.
