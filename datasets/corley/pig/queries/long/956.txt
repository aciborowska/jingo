The proposal is to split the tests into 2 groups:

(1) Ten-minute tests - this is a set of tests that run with every patch submission and takes aproximately 10 minutes
(2) All tests - these include all tests and they will run nightly

This is similar to work done in Hadoop: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-458
