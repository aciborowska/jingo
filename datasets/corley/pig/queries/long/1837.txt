I have the following 2 inputs:

data1: 
1       11
2       15

data2:
1       10
4       11
5       10

And the following script to work on the data:

grunt> A = load 'data1' as (x, y: int);
grunt> B = load 'data2' as (x, z: int);
grunt> C = cogroup A by x, B by x;
grunt> D = foreach C generate group, SUM(((IsEmpty(A.y))? 
{(0)} : A.y)) + SUM (((IsEmpty(B.z))? {(0)}
 : B.z));
grunt> dump D;

After running for a while, I get the following error:

Backend error : org.apache.pig.builtin.IsEmpty cannot be cast to org.apache.pig.Accumulator
