There are many bugs in Pig related to the parser, particularly to bad error messages.  After review of Java CC we feel these will be difficult to address using that tool.  Also, the .jjt files used by JavaCC are hard to understand and maintain.  

ANTLR is being reviewed as the most likely choice to move to, but other parsers will be reviewed as well.

This JIRA will act as an umbrella issue for other parser issues.
