It seems like the only way to turn off split combining is by setting pig.noSplitCombination in the configuration.

In PigInputFormat line 252:

boolean combinable = !(loadFunc instanceof MergeJoinIndexer) &&
!(IndexableLoadFunc.class.isAssignableFrom(loadFunc.getClass())) &&
!(CollectableLoadFunc.class.isAssignableFrom(loadFunc.getClass()) &&
  OrderedLoadFunc.class.isAssignableFrom(loadFunc.getClass()));
if (combinable)
  combinable = !conf.getBoolean("pig.noSplitCombination", false);



However, if you're writing a LoadFunc whose underlying InputFormat is going to do the split combining itself, the only way to set this parameter in the configuration is 
to do it in the LoadFunc.setLocation() method (which seems like a bad place to do that) because it's the only method that gives you acces to the configuration.

It would be nice if LoadFunc could either:
a) Have an init method that gets passed the Configuration
b) Have access to a static method like PigInputFormat.setCombineSplits(false);
