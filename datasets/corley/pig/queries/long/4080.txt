Executing Pig scripts in a multi-tenant environment within the context of the app server requires disabling certain other commands that could be dangerous. For eg, the shell commands contained within the pig script will be executed as the user (possibly superuser) on the app server. The following is an example

%declare X `id`;

An admin might want to disable certain features, such as either disabling "shell" entirely or even being extra cautious by disabling "declare". Some more commands that could be disabled are - default, define (dynamic invokers), run and exec.
