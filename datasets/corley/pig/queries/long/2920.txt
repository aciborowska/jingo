I am not sure why but e2e tests set PERL5LIB like this:

<env key="PERL5LIB" value="./libexec"/>



This overrides any env variable, so there is no way to use custom Perl installations.

This patch just removes the line, thus we will rely on the user to configure PERL5LIB appropriately.
With this modification I am able to use my custom Perl installation.
