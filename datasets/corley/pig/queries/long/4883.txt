The following code and data will raise an exception.
However, if I remove any of the four "store"s, the code will be fine.

test.pig
r = load 'test.txt' as (id: chararray, val: long);

t1 = filter r by val >= 12 and val < 20;
grpd = group t1 by val;
t1_cnt = foreach grpd generate group as name, COUNT(t1) as value;
t1_cnt = foreach t1_cnt generate (chararray)name, value;
grpd = group t1 all;
t1_cnt_total = foreach grpd generate 't1' as name, COUNT(t1) as value; 

t2 = filter r by val >= 20 and val < 30;
grpd = group t2 by val;
t2_cnt = foreach grpd generate group as name, COUNT(t2) as value;
--t2_cnt = foreach t2_cnt generate (chararray)name, value;
grpd = group t2 all;
t2_cnt_total = foreach grpd generate 't2' as name, COUNT(t2) as value;

store t1_cnt  into 'outx/3';
store t2_cnt  into 'outx/4';
store t1_cnt_total into 'outx/5';
store t2_cnt_total into 'outx/6';


and
test.txt
c	12




will cause error:

I don't know why the code need to cast a BinSedesTuple to Long.
