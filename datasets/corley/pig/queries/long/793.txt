Currently, our tuple is a real pig and uses a lot of extra memory. 

There are several places where we can improve memory efficiency:

(1) Laying out memory for the fields rather than using java objects since since each object for a numeric field takes 16 bytes
(2) For the cases where we know the schema using Java arrays rather than ArrayList.

There might be more.
