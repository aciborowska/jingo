In the new pipeline, when possible, pig uses hadoop writable comparable types for the hadoop key rather than tuple.  As of hadoop 0.17 there is no DoubleWritable type.  It has been added for hadoop 0.18.  But it appears that we will be ready to integrate the types branch back into trunk before hadoop 0.18 is released.  So we need to implement a DoubleWritable for ourselves until that time.

The code can be taken from HADOOP-3061.  The code where we convert to and from hadoop types (DataType.getWritableComparableTypes and convertToPigType) needs to be changed to use this type.
