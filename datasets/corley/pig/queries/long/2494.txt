I wanted to add two features to SequenceFileLoader.
1.	I added a delimiter so it will act more like PigStorage, in that it will Split the value if it is a type Text (chararray).
2.	I added the option of the key being a NullWritable.  I wanted to be able to process my Hive files in both Hive and Pig, but because my Hive sequence files have a NullWritable key I could not make this work with the current implementation of SequenceFileLoader.

My change is attached to this Issue.
