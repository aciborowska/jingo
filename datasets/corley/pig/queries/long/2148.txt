If you use Pig downloaded from Apache with Hadoop 0.20.203 or CDH3, you have to use the pig-withouthadoop.jar instead of pig-core.jar.  However bin/pig uses pig-core.jar, meaning you can't use the shell script to start Pig.  We need to add a -without option to bin/pig so that it will pick up the pig-withouthadoop.jar.
