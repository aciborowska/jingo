When registering a local resource using a relative path, the resource is added to the JobXXXX jar under its absolute path.

If a pig script contains the following:

REGISTER etc/foo;

and is executed from a directory /PATH/TO/DIR, the JobXXXX jar file will contain the following:

/PATH/TO/DIR/etc/foo

instead of

etc/foo

which was the previous behavior
