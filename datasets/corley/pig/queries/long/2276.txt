Applying "is null" to the result of a UDF inside the ternary operator gives a syntax error: 

A = LOAD 'data.tsv' AS (a, b);
B = FOREACH A GENERATE ( parseNull(a) is null ? 1 : 0 );

gives the following error: Syntax error, unexpected symbol at or near 'parseNull'

The same error happens if parseNull is replaced by any other function, e.g. (TRIM(a) is null ? 1 : 0) will give the same error message.
However (a is null ? 1 : 0) and (parseNull(a) == '' ? 1 : 0) gets parsed without error, so it is related to the combination of "is null" and the result of a UDF.
