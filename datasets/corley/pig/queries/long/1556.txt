We need a way to kill a running Pig script cleanly. This is very similar to " hadoop job -kill" command. This requirement means the following. 

1) Support a "pig -kill <script ID>" or a similar syntax. The script ID or some unique handle should be easily available for the user to identify a running Pig job.
2) The command will then identify all the MR jobs that are currently spawned by this given Pig script.
3) It will internally usse "hadoop job -kill" to kill each one of those MR jobs spawned.
4) It will do any other cleanup necessary and also make sure all mappers/reducers emanating from this Pig script are killed.
