Given data;

input1:


id9     0



input2:


id8     1
id9     1



Pig script


A = LOAD 'input1' AS (id:chararray, val:long);
B = LOAD 'input2' AS (id:chararray, val:long);
C = COGROUP A BY id, B BY id;
D = FOREACH C GENERATE group, SUM(B.val), SUM(A.val), (SUM(A.val) - SUM(B.val));
dump D;



generates incorrect data:


(id8,1L,,)
(id9,1L,0L,-2L)



The workaround is to replace the FOREACH statement with


D = FOREACH C GENERATE group, SUM(B.val) as b, SUM(A.val) as a;
E = FOREACH D GENERATE $0, b, a, (a-b);
