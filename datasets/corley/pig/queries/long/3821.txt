The http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/pig/tags/release-0.12.0/build.xml contains

    <property name="pig.version" value="0.12.1" />
    <property name="pig.version.suffix" value="-SNAPSHOT" />

2014-03-19 21:39:30,960 [main] INFO  org.apache.pig.Main - Apache Pig version 0.12.1-SNAPSHOT (rUnversioned directory) compiled Mar 19 2014, 16:56:18
