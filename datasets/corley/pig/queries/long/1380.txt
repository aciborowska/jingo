Currently there is no Zebra versioning info available. Some disk entities like schema file and TFile do have persistent versions. However there is no Zebra version in general which is accessible by a user.

We need to add this info, preferrably in a build file, so that the runtime jar file will have the info available for the dumpInfo method to display to the caller.
