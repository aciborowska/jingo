Lets say my current working dir (CWD) is /user/x and there exists a file 'a';


The following results in an error:

a = load 'a';

cd /

dump a;


The problem is that the logical plan does not have fully qualified name for 'a' and it is converted only when the
physical plan compilation is done. So in between if someone changes the directory as above we have a problem.

As a user I do not worry/know about the side effects of pig's choice to execute queries lazily. So when I asked it to
load 'a' I made sure that I was in the right directory. I think that the file is loaded and I change the directory. Now
when the dump is asked for, the compilation starts and all it does to qualify the filename is to get the CWD and append
it with the filename if its not absolute already. Hence the problem.

One solution is to store the FQFN while parsing the query. Since there might users of just the logical plan like
pigbody, I think the logical plan should support this.
