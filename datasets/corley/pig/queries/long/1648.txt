For instance, if a small split has block locations h1, h2 and h3; another small split has h1, h3, h4. After combination, the composite split contains 4 block locations. If the number of component splits is big, then the number of block locations could be big too. In fact, the  number of block locations serves as a hint to M/R as the best hosts this composite split should be run on so the list should contain a short list, say 5, of the hosts that contain the most data in this composite split.
