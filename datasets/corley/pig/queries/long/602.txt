We are seeking an easy way to pass a large number of global configurations to UDFs.

Since our application contains many pig jobs, and has a large number of configurations. Passing configurations through command line is not an ideal way (i.e. modifying single parameter needs to change multiple command lines). And to put everything into the hadoop conf is not an ideal way either.

We would like to see if Pig can provide such a facility that allows us to pass a configuration file in some format(XML?) and then make it available through out all the UDFs.
