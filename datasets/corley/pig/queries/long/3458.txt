Our user reported an issue where their scalar results goes missing when having two store statements.


A = load 'test1.txt' using PigStorage('\t') as (a:chararray, count:long);
B = group A all;
C = foreach B generate SUM(A.count) as total ;
store C into 'deleteme6_C' using PigStorage(',');

Z = load 'test2.txt' using PigStorage('\t') as (a:chararray, id:chararray );
Y = group Z by id;
X = foreach Y generate group, C.total;
store X into 'deleteme6_X' using PigStorage(',');

====Inputs
 pig> cat test1.txt
a       1
b       2
c       8
d       9
 pig> cat test2.txt
a       z
b       y
c       x
 pig>



Result X should contain the total count of '20' but instead it's empty.


 pig> cat deleteme6_C/part-r-00000
20
 pig> cat deleteme6_X/part-r-00000
x,
y,
z,
 pig>



This works if we take out first "store C" statement.
