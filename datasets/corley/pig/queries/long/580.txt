Currently Pig uses the combiner only when there is foreach following a group when the elements in the foreach generate have the following characteristics:
1) simple project of the "group" column
2) Algebraic UDF

The above conditions exclude use of the combiner for distinct aggregates - the distinct operation itself is combinable (irrespective of whether it feeds to an algebraic or non algebraic udf). So if the following foreach should also be combinable:

..
b = group a by $0;
c = foreach b generate { x = distinct a; generate group, COUNT(x), SUM(x.$1) }



The combiner optimizer should cause the distinct to be combined and the final combine output should feed the COUNT() and SUM() in the reduce.
