Currently, it is "valid" for a UDF's outputSchema to return a Schema of more than one field (ie an int,int,long). This causes weird error (different treatment in the case of one value instead of multiple).

I will add a check where you can only have one field (multiple fields should be contained in a Tuple).

This will potentially not be backwards compatible, but it is a bug that people do that.
