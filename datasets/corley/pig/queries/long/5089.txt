Hello, I'm trying to execute some Pig Script on an Hadoop Vanilla cluster. I loaded my files on hdfs, I created the jobs and I imported the libraries (some jars and udfs), but when I run the jobs they failed and I don't know why.
How could I run them properly? Where are the libraries need to be inserted?
