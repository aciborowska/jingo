Just stumbled upon this issue over the weekend. It appears the built-in CONCAT function will return null in the advent of 1 item in the Tuple being null. If this is as intended it would be nice if the docs made note of this. Otherwise it would be nice if nulls where just skipped and a proper string of what was left was returned. If all items are null then just return null in that case.
