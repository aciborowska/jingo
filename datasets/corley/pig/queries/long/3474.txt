If you use a *nix command like RMF or MV, pig evaluates this before everything else in the script. This is unexpected behavior because PIG should only run the *nix commands as they encounter them and not out of line.

For example, this pig script will fail because of an 'IllegalArgumentException' for not finding 'data' because it ran RMF first and not as per the sequence

mydata = LOAD 'data'
--process data into new_data
RMF 'data'
STORE new_data into 'data;

This is unacceptable behavior and should be rectified.
