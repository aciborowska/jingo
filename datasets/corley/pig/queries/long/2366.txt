Currently, Utils.getSchemaFromString will die if you give it something like "double." Ideally, it should give some reasonable default. For example, if given

tuple(int,int,float)


you'd get a schema that is equivalent to

t1:tuple(x1:int, x2:int, x3:float)



This would be convenient for the growing list of things which use this helper function to allow more convenient Schema specification (scripting language udfs, OutputSchema annotations)
