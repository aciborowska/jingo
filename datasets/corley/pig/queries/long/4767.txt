To reproduce:
test.pig
a = load 'a.txt';
a_group = group a all;
a_count = foreach a_group generate COUNT(a) as count;

b = load 'mytable' using org.apache.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();
b = filter b by datepartition == '2015-09-01-00' and foo == a_count.count;

dump b;


The above query ends up reading all the table partitions. If you remove the foo == a_count.count clause or replace a_count.count with a constant, then partition filtering happens properly.
