Want to be able to extract search terms from a url. For example,

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=active&rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-24,GGLG:en&q=purpose+of+life&btnG=Search

then

purpose of life

would be extracted.

Pig latin usage looks like

searchTerms = FOREACH row GENERATE org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.util.apachelogparser.SearchTermExtractor(url);
