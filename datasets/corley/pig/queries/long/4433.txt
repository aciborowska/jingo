The parsing of BigDecimal data types in a nested tuple, as implemented by Utf8StorageConverter.java, does not work. There's a "break;" missing from a switch statement.

Code example that demonstrates the problem:

=== input.txt ===
(17,1234567890.0987654321)

=== pig_script ===:
inp = LOAD 'input.txt' AS (foo:tuple(bar:long, baz:bigdecimal));
STORE inp INTO 'output';

=== output ===
(17,)


With patch, the output becomes the expected:
(17,1234567890.0987654321)
