Noticed few things while browsing code

1) DefaultTuple has a protected boolean isNull = false; which is never used. Removing this gives ~3-5% improvement for big jobs
2) Config checking with ThreadLocal conf is repeatedly done for each record. For eg: createDataBag in POCombinerPackage. But initialized only for first time in other places like POPackage, POJoinPackage, etc.
