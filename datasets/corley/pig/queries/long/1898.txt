When running a pig script in mapreduce mode without accessing a cluster, the last operation fails with a confusing error message, I assume that the path constructed would be accessible on a hdfs filesystem, but it doesn't make sense in the local filesystem. It would be better to give a error message or a warning at the start of the script that this may fail due to the missing hdfs reference.

java.lang.RuntimeException: org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.InvalidInputException: Input path does not exist: file:/user/alex/pigsample_7169802_1299889140078

(/user/alex/ would be a valid home directory on a hdfs filesystem, but in the local filesystem, its wrong).
