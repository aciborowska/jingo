Frequently, users are interested on Top results (especially Top K rows) . This can be implemented efficiently in Pig /Map Reduce settings to deliver rapid results and low Network Bandwidth/Memory usage.

 Key point is to prune all data on the map side and keep only small set of rows with Top criteria . We can do it in Algebraic function (combiner) with multiple value output. Only a small data-set gets out of mapper node.

The same idea is applicable to solve variants of this problem:


	An Algebraic Function for 'Top K Rows'
	An Algebraic Function for 'Top K' values ('Top Rank K' and 'Top Dense Rank K')
	TOP K ORDER BY.



Another words implementation is similar to combiners for aggregate functions but instead of one value we get multiple ones. 

I will add a sample implementation for Top K Rows and possibly TOP K ORDER BY to clarify details.
