I'm using HCatStorer to write to external Hive table with partition from Pig and have the following different use cases:

1) Need to overwrite (aka, refresh) data into table: Currently I end up doing this outside (drop partition and delete HDFS folder) of Pig which is very painful and error-prone

2) Need to append (aka, add new file) data to the Hive external table/partition: Again, I end up doing this outside of Pig by copying file in appropriate folder 

It would be very productive for the developers to have both options in HCatStorer.
