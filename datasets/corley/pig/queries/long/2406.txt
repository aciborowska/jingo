Hi,

When 2.51 (type: double) is added 24 times using SUM, it gives you result of 60.23999999999997. 
If a user wants to control the precision, that is, in the result he requires 60.24, it wouldnt be possible unless he implements a custom UDF.

So if we can have a way to improve double precision, 
for eg: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html
Here with BigDecimal, one can improve the double precision and with MathContext, the user has control to set the precision.

Can we have a new UDF which can do the same?

Regards,
Anitha
