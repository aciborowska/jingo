Currently, for map-only jobs, Pig writes map-outputs directly to HDFS and then sends zero data to reducers. The problem with this is two fold:

	Reduce slots are unnecessarily wasted on the cluster
	Reduces write empty files to HDFS putting pressure on the Namenode



Both these can we very easily avoided by just calling:

job.setNumReduces(0);


and letting Hadoop Map-Reduce take care of writing map-outputs directly to HDFS.
