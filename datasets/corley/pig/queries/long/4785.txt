  If diamond shaped edge (two edges going to same vertex), we do not merge into Split. Lot of data is transferred because of that. It can be optimized to merge the operator into the Split, but still have a POValueInputTez->POValueOutputTez vertex which just will be used to redirect the input to avoid the diamond shaped edge.  This will allow filtering and other processing to happen in the Split operator itself and the data transferred to the routing vertex will be minimal.
