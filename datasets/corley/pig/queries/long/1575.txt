The Optimization rule under the new logical plan, PushUpFilter, only does a subset of optimization scenarios compared to the same rule under the old logical plan. For instance, it only considers filter after join, but the old optimization also considers other operators such as CoGroup, Union, Cross, etc. The migration of the rule should be complete.

Also, the test cases created for testing the old PushUpFilter wasn't migrated to the new logical plan code base. It should be also migrated. (A few has been migrated in JIRA-1574.)
