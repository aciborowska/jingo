When I have multiple filter statements joined by AND/OR , except for the first condition all other conditions are ignored.
For example in the below script the second condition (org.udfs.Func09('e',w) == 1) is ignored ;

a = load 'sample_input' using PigStorage(',')  as (q:chararray,w:chararray);
b = filter a by org.udfs.Func09('f1',q) == 1  AND  org.udfs.Func09('e',w) == 1 ;
dump b;

Output from the script
(f1,a)
(f1,e)  --> this record should have been filtered by the second condition

Input for the script;
f1,a
f2,b
f3,c
f1,e
f2,f
f5,e


The explain of the alias b shows that the second condition is not included in the plan itself.
The above statements works fine with Pig 0.8.
