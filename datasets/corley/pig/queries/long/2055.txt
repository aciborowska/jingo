On certain builds, i see that pig fails to support this syntax -


grunt> l = load 'x' using PigStorage(':');           
2011-05-10 09:21:41,565 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1200: <line 1, column 29>  mismatched input '(' expecting SEMI_COLON

I seem to be the only one who has seen this behavior, and I have seen on occassion when I build on mac. It could be problem with antlr and apple jvm interaction.
