I am interested in building pig with Hadoop 0.23, so I added the following top-level build.properties file: 


hadoopversion=23



I found that, with this environment ant clean piggybank does not succeed, despite the presence of PIG-2410. I get the following errors (other errors beyond first removed for brevity):


compile:
