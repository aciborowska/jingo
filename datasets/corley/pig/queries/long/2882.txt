There are places where java.util.Stack is used.

Replace it with java.util.Deque because it java.util.Stack is a legacy class and extends java.util.Vector which is synchronized and slow.

Quote from the java.util.Deque javadoc:

>Deques can also be used as LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stacks. This interface should be used in preference to the legacy Stack class.
