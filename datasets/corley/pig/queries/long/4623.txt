A new line character should be allowed inside a double quote as a valid csv document. For example, the following csv document should be treated as a SINGLE valid csv data

Iphone,"
{ ItemName : Cheez-It
21 Ounce}
",

However, the current implementation of the getNext() inside org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.CSVLoader class fails to take care of this case and it sees two lines of data while in fact it should be treated as single line of data.

This pull request fixes the above issue.
