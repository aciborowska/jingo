Probably PIG-3419 changed the order of the call such that now 'explain' is  showing the logicalPlan before the LogicalPlanOptimizer.optimize() is being called.

Before we had 

1030             PhysicalPlan pp = compilePp();
1031             currDAG.lp.explain(lps, format, verbose);


where  LogicalPlanOptimizer.optimize() was called from compilePp().
