This is a patch to fix errors in document "Built In Functions".


	Heading of the result table of ROUND function is wrongly written as CEIL(x)
	"Syntax" clause of LAST_INDEX_OF function is wrongly written as LAST_INDEX_OF(expression), but the function actually takes three arguments
	"Syntax" clause of REGEX_EXTRACT_ALL function is wrongly written as REGEX_EXTRACT (string, regex)
	An example of REPLACE function is terminated by a semicolon: REPLACE(string,'software','wiki');, but the semicolon is not necessary in Pig Latin syntax
	"limit" argument of STRSPLIT function is described as The number of times the pattern ... is applied. But actually, limit-1 is the maximum number of times the pattern is applied, and "limit" means the maximum length of the result tuple (if the value is positive). If the value is 0 or negative, not limit is applied.
	An example program of TOP function does not work, because it uses COUNT(*)
	Updates links to pages in the Java API Reference
	Fixes typos
	
		"COUNT_STAR is used the to count ..."
		"delimit in JsonLoader or JsonStorer JsonStorage ..."
		"using field deliminters delimiters ..."
		"If you store reading using delimiter "#" ..."
		"The STORE function statement specifies that the files ..."
		"Limit" -> "limit" in a term definition of STRSPLIT function
