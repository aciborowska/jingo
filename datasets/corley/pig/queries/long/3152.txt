In Pig 0.10.1 HTable class is defined under the same package as it is in HBase package. Much more, the version of this class seems to be very old: several methods do not exists or have a different signature.
Since in my use case  HBase is a transitive dependency, I cannot remove it and I need last version of it(same deployed on my cluster).
