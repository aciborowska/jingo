If a semi-colon is included in a comment that splits a GENERATE statement, Pig fails with either this error:
ERROR 1200: <line 0, column -1>  Syntax error, unexpected symbol at or near 'null'
or just:
ERROR 1200: null

This error does not happen if the comment does not split a statement.  I did not test this with non-GENERATE statements.

This happens both in grunt and when running a pig script from a file, though it is primarily an issue with the file.

Grunt example:

grunt> m = LOAD '/user/suryasev/fips2.txt' USING PigStorage('\t');
grunt> n = FOREACH m GENERATE $4 as first_item, $5 as second_item;
grunt> describe n;
n: 
{first_item: bytearray,second_item: bytearray}
grunt> k = FOREACH n GENERATE first_item, --some comment;
