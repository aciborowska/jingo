Currently Bloom requires the user to have stored the result of a previous query using BuildBloom to an HDFS file before it can be used.  This means the user must submit an "exec" between this store and the filter that uses Bloom if they are to be used in the same script.  

If Bloom could take a relation as its first input (ala the relation cast to scalar) then users would not need to put an exec in their script or manage a storage location on HDFS.

Sometimes storing the results in the file makes sense, so we don't want to remove the current behavior, just add another option.
