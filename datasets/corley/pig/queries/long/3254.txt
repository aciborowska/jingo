Credit to [~asitecn]. Currently Pig could launch several mapreduce job simultaneously. When one mapreduce job fail, we need to wait for simultaneous mapreduce job finish. In addition, we could potentially launch additional jobs which is doomed to fail. However, this is unnecessary in some cases:

	If "stop.on.failure==true", we can kill parallel jobs, and fail the whole script
	If "stop.on.failure==false", and no "store" could success, we can also kill parallel jobs, and fail the whole script



Consider simultaneous jobs may take a long time to finish, this could significantly improve the turn around in some cases.
