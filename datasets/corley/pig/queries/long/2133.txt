The following example illustrates:

data1 = LOAD ...
sampled_data1 = SAMPLE data1 0.1;
STORE sampled_data1 INTO sampled_data1.file;

data2 = LOAD ...
joined = JOIN sampled_data1 BY field1, data2 BY field2;
STORE joined INTO joined.file;

What I found is that records in joined.file DO NOT appear in sampled_data1.file, although if they could be joined with sampled_data1 in the first place, they should. The execution steps seem to indicate that the 2nd MR step generates a new sample from data1 before it joins it with data2. Therefore if the sampling rate is low we won't find most of the records of joined in sampled_data1.file .

The fix (thanks Dmitriy!): force flushing and reload the sampled data by inserting after the first STORE:

EXEC;
sampled_data1 = LOAD sampled_data1.file;
