1) "lzo2" was used as the compressor name for the LZO compression algorithm; it should be "lzo" instead;
2) the default compression is changed from "lzo" to "gz" for gzip;
3) In JAVACC file SchemaParser.jjt, the package name was wrong using the old "package org.apache.pig.table.types";
4) in build.xml, two new javacc targets are added to generate TableSchemaParser and TableStorageParser java codes;
5) Support of column group security ( https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-987 ) lacked support of the dumpinfo method: the groups and permissions were not displayed. Note that as a consequence, the patch herein must be applied after that of JIRA987.
6) and 7) a couple of issues reported in Jira917.
