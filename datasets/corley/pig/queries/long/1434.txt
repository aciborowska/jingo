This jira is to implement a simplified version of the functionality described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-801.

The proposal is to allow casting relations to scalar types in foreach.

Example:

A = load 'data' as (x, y, z);
B = group A all;
C = foreach B generate COUNT(A);
.....
X = ....
Y = foreach X generate $1/(long) C;

Couple of additional comments:

(1) You can only cast relations including a single value or an error will be reported
(2) Name resolution is needed since relation X might have field named C in which case that field takes precedence.
(3) Y will look for C closest to it.

Implementation thoughts:

The idea is to store C into a file and then convert it into scalar via a UDF. I believe we already have a UDF that Ben Reed contributed for this purpose. Most of the work would be to update the logical plan to
(1) Store C
(2) convert the cast to the UDF
