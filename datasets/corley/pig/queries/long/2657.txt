Hi,

It would be good if Pig would print a warning (or refuse to run) if you are using an unsupported version of jython. I spent a couple of hours before figuring out that you had to use 2.5.0. I've seen posts indicating that others have run into this problem as well.

Might write up a patch if others agree this is an issue.
