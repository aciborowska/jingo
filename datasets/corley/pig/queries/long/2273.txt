When using embedded Pig inside python, Pig.compileFromFile fails when the referenced pig file starts with a comment.

When you start the referenced pig file with a comment, you get no plan back and hence cannot successfully execute the job.  When you start the same script without a comment, you get a plan and can execute the script successfully.

Strangely, this issue does not appear when using Pig.compile to compile directly from a string.
