This is related to PIG-2010 with a slightly different approach
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-2010
Currently Pig bundles up all dependencies in a single jar which is a lot of overhead when there are a lot of dependencies and short lived jobs. This patch instead pushes the dependencies to distributed cache and uses the PigContext classloading mechanism to make the UDFs available.

Possible improvements: push jars to HDFS/distributed cache only once per script. have a cache on HDFS to avoid repeatedly pushing jars to HDFS.
