The current pig.properties file can use some love. Each property should be introduced by a documentation string explaining


	what the feature does,
	what its default and other allowed values are,
	why a user might change it from the default,
	and what might go wrong with each.



The documentation should follow a common format – I propose the following guidelines:


	Each property should supply either a bulleted list of acceptable values, indicating the default; or provide the default value inline with the description
	Don't say 'This setting lets you control whether Pig will decide to use the Hemiconducer feature', say 'Enables the hemiconducer feature, which [...]'
	Don't document the internals of the feature. Describe its impact on job execution or performance.
	Use consistent indentation, title formatting, and block delimiting. (The current patch does not yet do so completely, as I'm figuring it out)
	Place each setting in the appropriate block according to its impact on the user experience.
	Call out Experimental features with `EXPERIMENTAL`, but group them with similar settings.
	If a setting is dangerous, call that out with `WARNING`
	If one value is always appropriate for casual use, or always appropriate for production use, we should call that out. Production use should assume a moderately loaded single rack hadoop cluster according to the major distro's reference configuration – people running massive-scale installations don't need this file's advice.



I've attached a patch that organizes the current properties file and documents everything I felt confident describing. This is a preliminary patch, as I'll need some help documenting many of the currently un-documented ones. Please review what I've written carefully; I have reasonable experience programming Pig but limited familiarity with the experimental features.
