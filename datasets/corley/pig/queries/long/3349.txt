Currently you can't cast a datetimeobject into a chararray:

grunt> B = foreach A generate (chararray)a; dump B;
2013-06-05 15:29:01,372 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1052: 
<line 8, column 24> Cannot cast datetime to chararray

Was this an oversight? The documented casting matrix does not show the datetime object so I'm not sure if the current behavior is correct or not.

My recommendation would be to support casting to and from strings. Casting from a string would behave exactly like loading a datetime. Casting to a string would be exactly the format you get when you dump a datetime.
