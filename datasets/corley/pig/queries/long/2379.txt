If you do this:
Schema s1=Utils.getSchemaFromString("b:bag
{t:tuple(name:chararray,age:int)}
");
Schema s2=Schema.getPigSchema(new ResourceSchema(s1));
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); //false!!

That's super weird! The reason is that getPigSchema was setting two level access to true for bags. I added a test, and deleted the piece that set it. I worked with trunk, but a cursory glance makes it appear that it should be able to work with other versions as well, as I don't think that code has changed for a while. I ran test-commit without issue, but haven't ran the full test suite.

I appreciate any feedback on this!
