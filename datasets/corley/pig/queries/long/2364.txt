This came up on the listserv. Someone wanted a way to turn (start,end) ranges like 
{(1,3),(2,2),(3,4)}
 into a timeseries with the number of ranges which include the given time ie 
{(1,1),(2,2),(3,2),(4,1)}
 with an optional lag parameter. This patch is that. I included tests. Maybe there is a better name, or this should be in a different package?
