As part of Pig 0.2 we have introduced support for user defined tuples and bags. At the time, however, we did not add an adequate set of tests to make sure the functionality works properly in the face of changes.

In the last month or so, we saw a couple of complains stating that the functionality has problems. We should figure out what the current state is (via unit tests) and and fix the issues as we find them. Until we have a comprehansive set of tests, the extend of the problem is not clear.

Dmitry, does elephant bird use custome tuples and/or bags?
