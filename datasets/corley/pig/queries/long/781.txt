If we have multiple MR jobs to run and some of them fail the behavior of the system is to not stop on the first failure but to keep going. That way jobs that do not depend on the failed job might still succeed.

The question is to how best report this scenario to a user. How do we tell which jobs failed and which didn't?

One way could be to tie jobs to stores and report which store locations won't have data and which ones do.
