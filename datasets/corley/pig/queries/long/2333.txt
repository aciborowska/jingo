I am parsing data using tika, which depends on a jar that contains a META-INF/*.SF (signature) file. This file contains a signature for the MANIFEST.MF file, which is obviously different when pig creates its jar. Processing works locally, but fails on a hadoop cluster.

I am attaching a patch that skips adding any zip entry that starts with META-INF and ends with .SF which fixes the problem I have.
