  The DAG view displays vertex name, id, time duration, task and status information for each vertex. It would be good to add the pig alias and feature (join, group by, etc) information to a "Description" Field to give a clear idea of what that vertex is doing something similar to Lipstick.  There was another suggestion to also have a "Code" section which can put part of the pig script relevant to that. Or the full pig script could be just set at the DAG level and users can go check on the alias with the pig script there.  Most of the time, when multiple users are responsible for a pipeline it is easy to have the pig script also displayed instead of having to go to svn and git to find the script. Easy for pig team during investigation as well. Need to check on the memory constraints.
