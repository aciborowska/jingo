It does so for scalar types but not for complext types and not for the fields inside of the complext types.

This is because it uses different code to parse scalar types by themselves and scalar types inside of a complex type. It should really use the same (its own code to do so.)

The code it is currently uses, is inside of TextDataParser.jjt and is also used to parse constants so we need to be careful if we want to make changes to it.
