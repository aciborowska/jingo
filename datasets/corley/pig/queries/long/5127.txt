For example, the following command fail:

ant -Dtestcase=TestPredeployedJar test-core-mrtez

The reason is mr test left hadoop-site.xml and interfere with tez test. MiniMRCluster and MiniTezCluster use a different set of config files (hadoop-site.xml vs core-site.xml+hdfs-site.xml) and will only clear it's own config file when starting.
