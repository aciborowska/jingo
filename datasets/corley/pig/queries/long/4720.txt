It is a minior issue. Spark related JARs are not included when importing project via IDE.

$ ant -Dhadoopversion=23 eclipse-files 


Open the generated .classpath, the spark related JARs are not in the classpathentry list.  Because the spark JARs were moved to a new  directory(PIG-4667), but eclipse-files target in build.xml are not changed.
