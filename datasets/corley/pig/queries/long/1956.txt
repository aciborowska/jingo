For the following pig script:

a = load 'x' as (name, age, gpa);
b = group a by name;
c = foreach b 
{ ba = filter a by age < '25'; bb = foreach ba generate gpa; generate group, flatten(bb);}

Parser gives the following error:

ERROR 0: <line 3, column 14> ...

It should give a more meaningful error message.
