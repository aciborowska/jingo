In the table of contents at the top of the Built In Functions page of the documentation for Pig versions 0.12.0, 0.12.1, and 0.13.0, "Terms" and "Usage" appear in the list of Eval Functions under PluckTuple. These are subheadings under PluckTuple and should not appear in the table of contents. The Terms and Usage headings under PluckTuple are <h3> headings but should be <h4> headings. This has been fixed in the documentation for Pig versions 0.14.0 and newer. Please also fix in the documentations for Pig versions 0.12.0, 0.12.1, and 0.13.0.
