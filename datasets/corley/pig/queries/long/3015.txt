The current AvroStorage implementation has a lot of issues: it requires old versions of Avro, it copies data much more than needed, and it's verbose and complicated. (One pet peeve of mine is that old versions of Avro don't support Snappy compression.)

I rewrote AvroStorage from scratch to fix these issues. In early tests, the new implementation is significantly faster, and the code is a lot simpler. Rewriting AvroStorage also enabled me to implement support for Trevni (as TrevniStorage).

I'm opening this ticket to facilitate discussion while I figure out the best way to contribute the changes back to Apache.
