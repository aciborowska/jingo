Right now we have CONCAT UDF which concatenate two strings. We don't have any UDF for mass concatenation. The functionality of the proposed udf can be exact reverse of STRSPLIT. 

STRSPLIT take a string and a regex and return a tuple of strings. On the same line MASSCONCAT can take a tuple and a delimeter as inputs and return a string as output.

Example:

Inputs - (a,b,c,d), "|"
Output - a|b|c|d
