This script works:

A = load 'test' using PigStorage(':') as (name: chararray, age: int, gpa: float);
B = group A by age;
C = foreach B 
{
   D = filter A by gpa > 2.5;
   E = order A by name;
   F = A.age;
   describe F;
   G = distinct F;
   generate group, COUNT(D), MAX (E.name), MIN(G.$0);}
dump C;

This one produces an error:

A = load 'test' using PigStorage(':') as (name: chararray, age: int, gpa: float);
B = group A by age;
C = foreach B 
{
   D = filter A by gpa > 2.5;
   E = order A by name;
   F = A.age;
   G = distinct F;
   generate group, COUNT(D), MAX (E.name), MIN(G);}
dump C;

Notice the difference in how MIN is passed the data.
