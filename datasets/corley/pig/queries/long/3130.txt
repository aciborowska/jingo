I have tuple like so:

    (a: (b:int, c:int, d:int, e:int))

I would like to call a UDF and pass a range of the nested tuple. This is what I would expect the command to be:

    FOREACH alias GENERATE myUDF(a.(c .. e));

but this gives me an error like

    ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1200: <line 12, column 133>  mismatched input '(' expecting SEMI_COLON
