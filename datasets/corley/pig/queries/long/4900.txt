Kindly help me to resolve the folowing issue of mine.
I have installed HADOOP 2.5.1 on  two UBUNTU 14.04 desktops in master-slave cluster configuration successfully. I have also installed HBASE 1.1.4 on it in pseudo-distributed mode. Finally I installed PIG 0.13.0. Now I am trying to bulkload data from HDFS file system to HBASE using PIG. Through PIG grunt shell( in map reduce mode) I have succesfully issued LOAD command to bulk read file from HDFS file system into PIG. Then I  issued DUMP command in a PIG variable. We struggled a lot to make things successful upto this point. Then we got stuck,  with the following problem:
Finally with several trial and errors, we failed to issue STORE command for storing the dumped data into HBASE table( created earlier in HBASE successfully). 
        The error encountered while using STORE command is PIG 1200: PIG failed to parse... Could not instantiate ......
       Kindly help us because we have tried almost everyting from internet. This forum is our last hope. 
With thanks and regards
