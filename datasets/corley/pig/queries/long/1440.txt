Refactoring DataType to use Enums instead of integer constants would provide many benefits, including:


	Cleaner code
	Easier to iterate over Enums
	Easier to add new Enums without braking backwards compatibility
	Can use EnumMaps for easily link values to Enums
	Better support for translation from Enums to Strings and viceversa



Int (or byte in Pig's case) Enum pattern has several drawbacks as summarized here http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/enums.html

Drawbacks:
We have to explicitly convert Enum values to bytes when serializing. This can be done in DataReaderWriter.
Possibly higher overhead than simply using bytes.
Refactoring might be difficult.


Thoughts?
