The following script


A = load 'input';
B = load 'emptydir';
C = join B by $0, A by $0 using 'skewed';
store C into 'output';



fails with "ERROR: java.lang.RuntimeException: Empty samples file';

In this case, the sample job has 0 maps.  Pig doesn't expect this and fails . 

For merge join the script

The merge join script


A = load 'input';
B = load 'emptydir';
C = join A by $0, B by $0 using 'merge';
store C into 'output';



the sample job again has 0 maps and the script  fails with " ERROR 2176: Error processing right input during merge join".

But if we change the join order: 


A = load 'input';
B = load 'emptydir';
C = join B by $0, A by $0 using 'merge';
store C into 'output';



The second job (merge) now has 0 maps and 0 reduces. And it generates an empty 'output' directory.

Order by on empty directory works fine and generates empty part files.
