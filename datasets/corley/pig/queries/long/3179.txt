When a task's PigSplit is containing more than wrappedSplit, it only logs the first fileinfo.

When debugging, I saw 

===== Task Information Header =====
Command: bash ....
Start time: Mon Feb 11 16:41:21 UTC 2013
Input-split file: hdfs://abc.bcd.efg:8020/tmp/hij/part-r-00000.bz2
Input-split start-offset: 0Input-split length: 11854247



but the actual error was happing while reading part-r-00007.bz2.  It would have been nice if the log showed all the info that task was going to read.
