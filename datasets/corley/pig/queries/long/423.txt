Query:

grunt> A = load '/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k' as (name: chararray, age, gpa);
grunt> C = foreach A generate (name is null ? '' : (name matches 'foo' ? 'FOO' : name));
grunt> describe C;

08/09/08 16:36:30 WARN pig.PigServer: bytearray is implicitly casted to chararray under LOBinCond Operator
C: 
{chararray}

The warnings look wrong since name is explicitely declared as chararray.
