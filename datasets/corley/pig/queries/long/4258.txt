Several issues found in Windows e2e tests:
1. Inconsistency in existing conf file, tmpPath is tmp/pigtest in default.conf, but /tmp/pigtest in others; We do perl cleanup using "$me =~ s/[^a-zA-Z0-9]*//g" in default.conf, but "chomp $me" in rpm.conf
2. build.xml only test tarball install, for rpm install which does not have the whole tarball, compiling test udf fail
3. Some tests fail due to different OS error message in grunt.conf
4. Windows cmd such as perl/awk use a different quoting to pass parameters
