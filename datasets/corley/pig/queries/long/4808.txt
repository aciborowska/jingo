If you define two PluckTuples with different regexes, and use them together, they will overwrite the regex field of one another's (this will not affect cases where non-regex prefixes are used).

Example (from testOutput in TestPluckTuple.java, modified)

a = load 'a' using mock.Storage();
b = load 'b' using mock.Storage();
c = join a by x, b by x;
define pluck1 PluckTuple('a::.*');
define pluck2 PluckTuple('b::.*');
d = foreach c generate pluck1 AS pluck1, pluck2 AS pluck2;

Expected:

((1,hey,2),(1,sasf,5))
((2,woah,3),(2,woah,6))

Actual:

((1,sasf,5),(1,sasf,5))
((2,woah,6),(2,woah,6))
