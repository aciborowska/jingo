From Pig-3251, testBZ2Concatenation [pig.bzip.use.hadoop.inputformat = true] is failing .


Koji Noguchi,
https://builds.apache.org/job/Pig-trunk-commit/2278/testReport/org.apache.pig.test/TestBZip/testBZ2Concatenation_pig_bzip_use_hadoop_inputformat___true__/ tests are failing. This should because concatenated bzip works with hadoop's TextInputFormat. Can you fix the testcase? I think it would be good to keep the original one which throws the exception for Pig's bzipinputformat and another one for hadoop's which passes and also verifies the output.
