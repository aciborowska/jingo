TezVertexStats uses TaskCounter.INPUT_RECORDS_PROCESSED to display records read from MRInput. But in cases of replicate join or scalar it also includes replicate join input.  Need to have a pig specific counter (MULTI_INPUTS_RECORD_COUNTER) in POSimpleTezLoad.

TezVertexStats uses TaskCounter.OUTPUT_RECORDS to display records stored to MROutput if there is single store. If there are multiple stores it uses MULTI_STORE_RECORD_COUNTER and there are no issues. If there is a single store with another output, then value from OUTPUT_RECORDS is wrong. Need to use MULTI_STORE_RECORD_COUNTER for all cases even if there is no multiple store.
