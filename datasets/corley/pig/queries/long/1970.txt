Pig will create an output/input dependency if the output generated by Pig script feeding to a load statement. So that Pig will not launch two jobs simultaneously (which will result a input file not exist error). For example:

STORE A INTO '/user/myname/myoutputfolder';
D = LOAD '/user/myname/myoutputfolder';


Load will be in a map-reduce job after /user/myname/myoutputfolder is generated.

However, currently we only do exact match. If we load part of the data, we cannot figure out the dependency. Eg:

STORE A INTO '/user/myname/myoutputfolder';
D = LOAD '/user/myname/myoutputfolder/part*' ;



We should be more intelligent to find this dependency.
