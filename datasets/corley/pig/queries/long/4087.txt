In order to improve the usability we have to add to the main WEBSITE  download's link.

github  provide this link , therefore instruction such as : 
svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/pig/trunk/
or
git clone https://github.com/apache/pig.git 
we can leave to the developers who want join to our project.

Just make me happy by copying link to the zip file from the github .

thanks .
