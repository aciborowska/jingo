On http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.7.0/tutorial.html#Pig+Tutorial+File there is a command (second-to-last comand in Pig Script 1) that results in an error:

ordered_uniq_frequency = ORDER filtered_uniq_frequency BY (hour, score);

I believe it should be written without the parentheses around the key fields:

ordered_uniq_frequency = ORDER filtered_uniq_frequency BY hour, score;
