Currently HiveUDF_7 is using DummyContextUDF class to validate that the UDF can increment counters. Right now this is using a MapredContext to report Pig warnings and at the end expects a certain number of warnings to be seen in the output.
This doesn't work for Spark mode (due to the usage of MapredContext) so a more general solution is needed before HiveUDF_7 test can be turned on for Spark as well.
