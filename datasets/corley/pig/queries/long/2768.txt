When compiling with hadoopversion=23 and running with hadoop 23 an annoying warning is printed:

WARN  org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration - fs.default.name is deprecated. Instead, use fs.defaultFS

because fs.default.name is set in the configuration properties in HExecutionEngine.java even if Pig is compiled for hadoop 23.
