Complex Pig Scripts often generate many Map-Reduce jobs, especially with the recent introduction of multi-store capabilities.
For example, the first script in the Pig tutorial produces 5 MR jobs.

There is currently very little support for debugging resulting jobs; if one of the MR jobs fails, it is hard to figure out which part of the script it was responsible for. Explain plans help, but even with the explain plan, a fair amount of effort (and sometimes, experimentation) is required to correlate the failing MR job with the corresponding PigLatin statements.

This ticket is created to discuss approaches to alleviating this problem.
