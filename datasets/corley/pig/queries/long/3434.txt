According to docs, for bincond operator "If a Boolean subexpression results in null value, the resulting expression is null" (http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.11.0/basic.html#nulls).

It works as described in plain foreach..generate expression:


in = load 'in';
out = FOREACH in GENERATE 1, ($0 > 0 ? 2 : 3);
dump out;



in (3 lines, 2nd is empty):

0

1



out:

(1,3)
(1,)
(1,2)



But if we wrap generated variables in tuple (or bag), we lose the whole 2nd line in output:


out = FOREACH in GENERATE (1, ($0 > 0 ? 2 : 3));



out:

((1,3))
()
((1,2))
