Current scalar implementation will write a scalar file onto dfs. When Pig need the scalar, it will open the dfs file directly. Each scalar file contains more than one part file though it contains only one record. This puts a huge load to namenode. We should consolidate part file before open it. Another optional step is put the consolicated file into distributed cache. This further bring down the load of namenode.
