I'd like to propose that we allow for a greater degree of customization in PigStorage.

An incomplete list features that we might want to add:


	flag to tell it to overwrite existing output if it exists
	flag to tell it to compress output using gzip|bzip|lzo (currently this can be achieved by setting the directory name to end in .gz or .bz2, which is a bit awkward)
	flag to tell it to store the schema and header (perhaps by merging in PigStorageSchema work?)
