As one of its members, a bag contains "age" of type "int". When this value is used as an argument to DIFF and cast as an int for the comparison, the following error is thrown:

9/02/11 14:20:46 INFO mapReduceLayer.MapReduceLauncher: 50% complete
09/02/11 14:21:31 ERROR mapReduceLayer.MapReduceLauncher: Map reduce job failed

09/02/11 14:21:31 ERROR grunt.Grunt: ERROR 1072: Out of bounds access: Request for field number 1 exceeds tuple size of 1



Steps to reproduce 


	valid use of DIFF with valid cast for bag field
TEST ErrorHandling.AggregateFunc_601



 A =LOAD '/user/pig/tests/data/types/DataAll' USING PigStorage() AS ( Fint:int, Flong:long, Fdouble:double, Ffloat:float, Fchar:chararray, Fchararray:chararray, Fbytearray:bytearray, Fmap:map[], Fbag:BAG
{ t:tuple( name, age, avg ) }
, Ftuple name:chararray, age:int, avg:float) );
B =GROUP A ALL; 
X =FOREACH B GENERATE DIFF ( ( BAG
{tuple(int)} ) A.Fbag.age, A.Fint );
 STORE X INTO '/user/pig/tests/results/araceli.1234390832/AggregateFunc_601.out' USING PigStorage();

 # invalid use of DIFF with valid cast for bag field, DIFF contains one argument instead off two
TEST ErrorHandling.AggregateFunc_60

 A =LOAD '/user/pig/tests/data/types/DataAll' USING PigStorage() AS ( Fint:int, Flong:long, Fdouble:double, Ffloat:float, Fchar:chararray, Fchararray:chararray, Fbytearray:bytearray, Fmap:map[], Fbag:BAG{ t:tuple( name, age, avg ) }, Ftuple name:chararray, age:int, avg:float) );
B =GROUP A ALL; 
X =FOREACH B GENERATE DIFF ( ( BAG{tuple(int)}
 ) A.Fbag.age ); 
STORE X INTO '/user/pig/tests/results/araceli.1234381533/AggregateFunc_60.out' USING PigStorage();
