When we run Mapper only jobs, All the intermediate outputs(compressed) are going to the user directory instead of going to tmp. If we run on small datasets, it shouldn't create a problem. But when I run for large datasets like more than 100TB lets say, it taking up so much disk space exceeding the disk space quota(setSpaceQuota) of 100GB also. Problem is happening before clean up.
