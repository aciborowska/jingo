consider the following example:

T = load ... ;
T1 = filter T by col == 'hello';
T2 = filter T by col =='world';

currently Pig optimizer does not combine the two predicates and cannot push down the predicates to the data sources (via LoadMetadata).  Thus the data source cannot do any filtering. A full table/file scan is required.

A current more efficient workaround (by hand) is to rewrite the above script to the following equivalent one:

T = load ...;
T = filter T by col == 'hello' or col == 'world' ;
T1 = filter T by col == 'hello';
T2 = filter T by col == 'world';

the above script enables Pig to push down the predicate (col == 'hello' or col == 'world') to the data source to use available partitions/indexes for potentially much more efficient processing. 

This JIRA is created to request PIG optimizer to perform the above type of optimization automatically.
