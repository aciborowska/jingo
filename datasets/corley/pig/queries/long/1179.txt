It seems there is a bug in PIG when ORDER BY is used twice on the same relation using ASC and DESC

I have the following script:

imei_start = FOREACH sessions GENERATE imei, start;
imei_starts = GROUP imei_start BY imei;
imei_retained_period = FOREACH imei_starts {
  ordered_imei_start = ORDER imei_start BY start DESC;
  first_start = LIMIT ordered_imei_start 1;
  rev_ordered_imei_start = ORDER imei_start BY start ASC;
  last_start = LIMIT rev_ordered_imei_start 1;
  GENERATE group, ordered_imei_start, rev_ordered_imei_start;
};

ordered_imei_start and rev_ordered_imei_start are actually the same (they are both sorted in the ASC way) and so last_start is always equal to first_start.

If only one of the 2 ORDER BY is performed, there is no issue.
