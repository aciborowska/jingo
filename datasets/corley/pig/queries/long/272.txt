The following script fails (stack is further down):

define CMD `perl identity.pl`;
define CMD1 `perl identity.pl`;
A = load '/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k' as (name, age, gpa);
B = stream A through CMD;
store B into 'B1';
C = stream B through CMD1;
D = JOIN B by name, C by name;
store D into 'D1';

If I remove the intermediate store, the script works fine. Also if I replace streaming commands with other operators such as filter and foreach, it works even with the intermediate store.
