Hello,
            I am facing an error 2998 : Unable to store data into hbase using pig. The details are 

I have PIG-0.13.0 , HBase-1.1.4, Hadoop-2.5.1.
Hadoop cluster is used. Hbase is in pseudo distributed mode. They are running fine. 
I have an input file with two lines of numbers. I have succesfully been able to load the file data from hdfs to pig variable using load command.  
Dump is also working. 
Now when I try to store the dumped data into hbase using HBaseStorage method, its showing 
error-2998-Unhandled internal error.  class:org/apache/pig/.../hbase/HBaseStorage, method: addRowFilter signature: (Lorg/apache.....) Incompatible argument to function

Please help. Also please specify what will be the content of my bashrc for PIG.
