 Currently verify_pig runs a different equivalent script as the testcase but runs with the same version of Pig. Ran into a issue where a test passed when a bug was introduced and benchmark files were not present. The newly generated benchmarks were also wrong. Caught the failure when running again pointing to previously generated benchmarks.
