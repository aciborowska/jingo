The following script fail:

a = load 'studenttab10k' as (name: chararray, age: int, gpa: float);
b = group a all;
c = foreach b generate SUM(a.age) as total;
c1= limit c 1;
d = foreach a generate name, age/(double)c1.total as d_sum;
store d into '111';



The problem is we have a reference to c1 in d. In the optimizer, we push limit before foreach, d still reference to limit, and we get the wrong schema for the scalar.
