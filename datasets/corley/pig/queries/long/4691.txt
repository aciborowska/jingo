PIG-4649 added support for blacklisting some storefuncs when applying union+store vertex group optimization as HCatStorer was not honoring mapreduce.output.basename and hardcoding part file names. Found that some of our user StoreFuncs also do that and ended up with partial results. So would be good to have a whitelist option as well where you can put StoreFuncs that do not mess with mapreduce.output.basename.
