When mixing static and dynamic column mappings, HBaseStorage sometimes doesn't pick up the static column values and nulls are returned. I believe this bug has been masked by HBase being a bit over-eager when it comes to respecting column filters (i.e. HBase is returning more columns than it should).

For example, this query returns nulls for the sc column, even when it contains data:

a = LOAD 'hbase://pigtable_1' USING
  org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.hbase.HBaseStorage
  ('pig:sc pig:prefixed_col_*','-loadKey') AS
  (rowKey:chararray, sc:chararray, pig_cf_map:map[]);



What is very strange (about HBase), is that the same script will return values just fine if sc is instead col_a, assuming of course that both columns contain data:

a = LOAD 'hbase://pigtable_1' USING
  org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.hbase.HBaseStorage
  ('pig:col_a pig:prefixed_col_*','-loadKey') AS
  (rowKey:chararray, col_a:chararray, pig_cf_map:map[]);



Potential HBase issues aside, I think there is a bug in the logic on the Pig side. Patch to follow.
