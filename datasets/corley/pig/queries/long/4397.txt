I have the following input:


one two
three
 four



I run this code

Lines =
    LOAD 'test.log' USING PigStorage(' ') 
    AS ( First:chararray , Second:chararray );

DUMP Lines;

STORE Lines INTO 'Lines'
USING org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.CSVExcelStorage('\t', 'NO_MULTILINE', 'WINDOWS', 'WRITE_OUTPUT_HEADER');



The output from the DUMP is correct:

(one,two)
(three,)
(,four)


The output from the CSVExcelStorage is incorrect:

First   Second
one     two
three   three
        four



The problem is that if the last field is a null then the previous value is repeated incorrectly (in this case 'three').
