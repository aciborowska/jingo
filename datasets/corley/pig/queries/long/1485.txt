Hi

Currently to instruct Pig to add a jar to its classpath and also make it available to the map/reduce jobs, we have use the "register" keyword with path to a jar.

This problem with this approach is that it hardcodes the pig latin script to a specific jar version thus making the pig latin script forward incompatible to any version upgrades to that jar.
I can see the value for this keyword in an interactive session i.e. when using the Grunt shell however feels like this is an incorrect thing to do in PigLatin script files.

Would be great if there was an alternative method to expose a jar to Pig such as using the classpath. 
This would help scripts do away with the need to embed registers in them and make them agnostic to jar file names.

The benefit of using the classpath is that there are lots of hooks to configure it from different environments e.g. $CLASSPATH when invoked from shell, testing frameworks like maven and junit can also inject stuff into classpath and so can frameworks like Oozie.

Thanks
