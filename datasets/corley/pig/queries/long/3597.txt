There are no option to turning batching off with this storage.

Some JDBC driver doesn't provide Batch Statement implementation.

org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.DBStorage.java:157
      this.ps.addBatch();
      this.count += 1;
      if (this.count > this.batchSize) {
        this.count = 0;
        this.ps.executeBatch();
        this.ps.clearBatch();
        this.ps.clearParameters();
      }



An easy fix is to use DatabaseMetaData.supportsBatchUpdates() in JDBC.

And to use only ps.execute() if the JDBC driver doesn't support Batch Statement.
