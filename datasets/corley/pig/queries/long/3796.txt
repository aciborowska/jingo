PIG-2924 added support for custom stats reader. But the FileBasedOutputSizeReader only checks for 


public static boolean isHDFSFileOrLocalOrS3N(String uri){
        if(uri == null)
            return false;
        if(uri.startsWith("/") || uri.matches("[A-Za-z]:.*") || uri.startsWith("hdfs:")
                || uri.startsWith("viewfs:") || uri.startsWith("file:") || uri.startsWith("s3n:")) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }


Better to change this to UriUtil.hasFileSystemImpl which will automatically filter out hbase://.  This would still not solve cases like HCatStorer which does not have a scheme. Will also write a default stats reader that checks for known StoreFuncInterface implementations that are not file based like HCatStorer. More standard ones can be added later. AccumuloStorage should not be a problem as it has scheme accumulo://.
