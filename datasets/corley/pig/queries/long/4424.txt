From a user:
I have a pig script which runs multiple map reduce jobs. (Ex: 'group by' and 'order by' which will be executed as 2 different map reduce jobs)
Is there a way to specify different map reduce configuration options for different stages instead of specifying them for the whole script (Ex: different values for mapred.min.split.size for different stages)?
