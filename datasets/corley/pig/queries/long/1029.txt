I have performed a set of benchmarks on HBaseStorage loader, using PIG 0.4.0 and HBase 0.20.0 (using the patch referred in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-970) and Hadoop 0.20.0.

The HBaseStorage loader is basically 10x slower than the PigStorage loader.

To bypass this limitation, I had to read my HBase tables, write them to a Hadoop file and then use this file as input for my subsequent computations.

I report this bug for the track, I will try to sse if I can optimise this a bit.
