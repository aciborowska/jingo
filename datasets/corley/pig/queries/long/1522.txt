Pig returns 1 for dryrun with the message:

"Dry run completed. Substituted pig script is at ..."

Some users are confused by the code "1", which usually indicate an error of the operation.  Because the dryrun is completed successfully, users expect "0".

The Pig Error Handling doesn't specify the code for dryrun.  It may make sense to return "0" for successful dryrun, or explain it in the document.
