currently we check PIG_HOME/conf/pig.properties existence to determine PIG_CONF_DIR and then check for /etc/pig

We should change that order to check for /etc/pig/pig.properties and if not set it to PIG_HOME/conf

The reason being pig rpm installs configs in /usr/conf which causes it to pick up /usr/conf rather than /etc/pig as the path.
