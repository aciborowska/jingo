The following areas in DefaultTuple.java can be changed:

The member methods get(), set(), getType() and isNull() all call checkBounds() which is redundant call since all these 4 functions throw ExecException. Instead of doing a bounds check, we can catch the IndexOutOfBounds exception in a try-catch and throw it as an ExecException

The write() method has the following unused object (d in the code below):

for (int i = 0; i < sz; i++) {
                try {
                    Object d = get(i);
                } catch (ExecException ee) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(ee);
                }
                DataReaderWriter.writeDatum(out, mFields.get(i));
            }



The get(i) call in the try should be replaced by the writeDatum call directly since d is never used and there is an unncessary call to get()
