From a single Pig script I write two completely different and unrelated CSV files; both with the flag 'WRITE_OUTPUT_HEADER'.

The bug is that both files get the SAME header at the top of the output file even though the data is different.

Reproduction:
foo.txt
1



bar.txt (Tab separated)
1	a



WriteTwoCSV.pig
FOO =
    LOAD 'foo.txt'
    USING PigStorage('\t')
    AS (a:chararray);

BAR =
    LOAD 'bar.txt'
    USING PigStorage('\t')
    AS (b:chararray, c:chararray);

STORE FOO into 'Foo'
USING org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.CSVExcelStorage('\t','NO_MULTILINE', 'UNIX', 'WRITE_OUTPUT_HEADER');

STORE BAR into 'Bar'
USING org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.CSVExcelStorage('\t','NO_MULTILINE', 'UNIX', 'WRITE_OUTPUT_HEADER');



Command:
pig -x local WriteTwoCSV.pig

Result:
cat Bar/part-*

b	c
1	a


cat Foo/part-*

b	c
1



The error is that the Foo output has a the two column header from the Bar output.
One of the effects is that parsing the Foo data will probably fail due to the varying number of columns
