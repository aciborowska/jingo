Within some contexts, the parser fails to treat semicolons correctly, and sees them as an EOL.


Given an input file:

/test1.txt (in the hdfs)
1;a
2;b
3;c
4;d
5;e


And the following Pig script:

REGISTER /tmp/piggybank.jar ;
DEFINE REGEXEXTRACTALL org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.string.RegexExtractAll();
lines = LOAD '/test1.txt' AS (line:chararray);
delimited = FOREACH lines GENERATE FLATTEN (
        REGEXEXTRACTALL(line, '^(\\d+);(w+)$')
) AS (
        digit:int,
        word:chararray
);
DUMP delimited;


I receive the following error:

ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1000: Error during parsing. Lexical error at line 5, column 40.  Encountered: <EOF> after : "\'^(\\\\d+);"
