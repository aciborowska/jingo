A statement like
BigDecimal scoreValue = new BigDecimal(0);
will correctly trigger a DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE message, because scoreValue is assigned a new value shortly thereafter without being read in between.
But if the line is changed to
BigDecimal scoreValue = new BigDecimal(0).setScale(8, BigDecimal.ROUND_HALF_UP);
it will incorrectly not trigger the message.
