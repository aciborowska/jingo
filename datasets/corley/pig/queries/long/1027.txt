Consider this very simple script containing few records


a = load 'foo';
store a into 'out';



Following message gets printed on grunt shell:

[main] INFO  org.apache.pig.backend.local.executionengine.LocalPigLauncher - Records written : 39
[main] INFO  org.apache.pig.backend.local.executionengine.LocalPigLauncher - Bytes written : 0

File has 39 records which is correctly reported. But number of bytes is always reported as zero, no matter what.  I am observing this on latest trunk, not sure if this existed on previous/current releases.
