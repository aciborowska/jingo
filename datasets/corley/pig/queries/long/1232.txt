This missing versioning in column group schema makes it difficult to evolve the index. For instance, prior to fix of PIG-1201, the index is empty for unsorted tables. However the index is useful even for unsorted tables to save a listStatus call to name node, which has been found expensive for directories of many disk entries inside it. As part of that fix, an index is built.. Without versioning but with the demand to support backward compatibility, another non-classical approach has to be figured out to build index when necessary. As part of this fix, we may also want to address that issue too.
