Streaming seems to be broken in dotNext. There are several tests that are failing.
The results from C below produce clean results.
The results from D which are streamed through CMD produce control characters on some of the output.

define CMD `perl GroupBy.pl '\t' 0` ship('/homes/monster/pigtest/pigtest_next/pigharness/dist/pig_harness/libexec/PigTest/GroupBy.pl');
A = load '/user/user1/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k';
B = group A by $0;
C = foreach B generate flatten(A);
D = stream C through CMD;
store C into '/user/user1/pig/out/user1.1321117428/ComputeSpec_7_C.out';
store D into '/user/user1/pig/out/user1.1321117428/ComputeSpec_7_D.out';
