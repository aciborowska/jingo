Currently the e2e test harness can work either against a database or it can compare against canned results.  We should also give an option to use an old version of Pig to test against.  This has value for two cases.  One, for scripts that cannot be tested against tested against a SQL database we do not have to carry the expected results.  Two, we can use it for compatibility testing between versions.
