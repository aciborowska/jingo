For the following piece of sample code in FOREACH which counts the filtered student records based on record_type == 1 and scores and also on record_type == 0 does not seem to return any results.


mydata = LOAD 'mystudentfile.txt' AS  (record_type,name,age,scores,gpa);
--keep only what we need
mydata_filtered = FOREACH  mydata GENERATE   record_type,  name,  age,  scores ;
--group
mydata_grouped = GROUP mydata_filtered BY  (record_type,age);

myfinaldata = FOREACH mydata_grouped {
     myfilter1 = FILTER mydata_filtered BY record_type == 1 AND age == scores;
     myfilter2 = FILTER mydata_filtered BY record_type == 0;
     GENERATE FLATTEN(group),
-- Only this count causes the problem ??
      COUNT(myfilter1) as col2,
      SUM(myfilter2.scores) as col3,
      COUNT(myfilter2) as col4;  };

--these set of statements confirm that the count on the  filters returns 1
--mycountdata = FOREACH mydata_grouped
--{
--      myfilter1 = FILTER mydata_filtered BY record_type == 1 AND age == scores;
--      GENERATE
--      COUNT(myfilter1) as colcount;
--};
--dump mycountdata;

dump myfinaldata;



But if you uncomment the  

 COUNT(myfilter1) as col2, 

, it seems to work with the following results..
(0,22,45.0,2L)
(0,24,133.0,6L)
(0,25,22.0,1L)

Also I have tried to verify if this is a issue with the 

 COUNT(myfilter1) as col2, 

 returning zero. It does not seem to be the case.
If 

  dump mycountdata; 

 is uncommented it returns:
(1L)
(1L)

I am attaching the tab separated 'mystudentfile.txt' file used in this Pig script. Is this an issue with 2 filters in the FOREACH followed by a COUNT on these filters??
