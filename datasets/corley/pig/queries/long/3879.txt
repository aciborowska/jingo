We are having an issue with multiple store statements in the same script. The STORE fails to insert the records into the database. The script is roughly as follows...


A = LOAD '...' USING CSVLoader ...;
STORE A INTO '/tmp/A-unused' USING DBStorage (org.postgresql.Driver, ..., INSERT INTO ....);
B = FOREACH A GENERATE X, Y, CONCAT(X, Y) as Z;
STORE B INTO '/tmp/B-unused' USING DBStorage (org.postgresql.Driver, ..., INSERT INTO ....);



Both DBStorage calls insert into different tables in the same database.

When the script is run both A, B are stored into their /tmp/ locations. However, the data never makes it into the database. We found two ways to get the data to make it into the database. The first, was to add a DUMP B command after the assignment of B. The second was to execute the script with the -M flag.
