The following query

A = load 'foo';
B = filer A by $0>1;
C = filter A by $1 = 'foo';
D = COGROUP C by $0, B by $0;
......

does not get efficiently executed. Currently, it runs a map only job that basically reads and write the same data before doing the query processing.

Query where the data is loaded twice actually executed more efficiently.

This is not an uncommon query and we should fix this issue.
