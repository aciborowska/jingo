With test.data:

foo
bar
bar
xyzzy
foo
foo
frob

this script test.pig:

orig = LOAD 'test.data' USING PigStorage();
DEFINE cat `cat`;
a1 = GROUP orig BY $0;
a2 = STREAM a1 THROUGH cat;
STORE a2 INTO 'one' USING PigStorage();
b1 = GROUP orig BY $0;
b2 = STREAM b1 THROUGH cat;
STORE b2 INTO 'two' USING PigStorage();

causes this output:

$ hadoop fs -cat one/part*
bar	
{(bar),(bar)}
$ hadoop fs -cat two/part*
bar	{(bar),(bar)}
$ 

that is, all but one line is lost from both results. In comparison, taking out one of the branches makes the other one behave right; this script is works.pig:

orig = LOAD 'test.data' USING PigStorage();
DEFINE cat `cat`;
a1 = GROUP orig BY $0;
a2 = STREAM a1 THROUGH cat;
STORE a2 INTO 'one' USING PigStorage();

and it produces this output:

$ hadoop fs -cat one/part*
bar	
{(bar),(bar)}
foo	
{(foo),(foo),(foo)}
frob	
{(frob)}
xyzzy	
{(xyzzy)}
