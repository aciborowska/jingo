Add a mechanism so that invocations of:



	register my.jar;



will search not only the local directory but a set of paths.  This could
simply be classpath.



This will permit users to have build trees of UDFs that commonly share
across different piglets

without having to copy the jar locally to each directory and without
having to use absolute

pathnames to refer to the files.
