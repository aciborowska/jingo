Hadoop FileOutputCommitter has a flag to write a _SUCCESS file in the output directory on job completion:

    mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.marksuccessfuljobs = true

PigOutputCommitter does not extend FileOutputCommitter thus did not get this feature when it was introduced to FileOutputCommitter.

The absence of this make Oozie coordinator jobs to work incorrectly when using Pig jobs.
