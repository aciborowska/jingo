Currently Zebra grammar for schema definition for collection field allows many types of definition. To reduce complexity and remove ambiguity, and more importantly, to make the meta data more representative of the actual data instances, the grammar rules need to be changed. Only a record type is allowed and required for collection definition. Thus,  fieldName:collection(record(c1:int, c2:string)) is legal, while fieldName:collection(c1:int, c2:string), fieldName:collection(f:record(c1:int, c2:string)), fieldName:collection(c1:int), or feildName:collection(int) is illegal.

This will have some impact on existing Zebra M/R programs or Pig scripts that use Zebra. Schema acceptable in previous release now may become illegal because of this change. This should be clearly documented.
