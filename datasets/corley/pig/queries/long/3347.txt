The problem is that intermediate 'store' invocation "changes" the final store output. Looks like it brings some kind of side effect. We did use 'local' mode to run script
here is the input data:
1
1
Here is the script:

a = load 'test';

a_group = group a by $0;
b = foreach a_group {
  a_distinct = distinct a.$0;
  generate group, a_distinct;
}
--store b into 'b';
c = filter b by SIZE(a_distinct) == 1;
store c into 'out';


We expect output to be:
1 1
The output is empty file.

Uncomment 

--store b into 'b';

 line and see the diffrence.
Yuo would get expected output.
