The current link to the AvroStorage document points to "http://snaprojects.jira.com/wiki/display/HTOOLS/AvroStorage+-+Pig+support+for+Avro+data" which doesn't exist AFAIK.

However, the Wiki has the relevant page and even references the broken link as the source of the information.

Link needs to be updated to point to the Wiki page: https://cwiki.apache.org/PIG/avrostorage.html
