Hi,

I'm trying to execute the sample test(testNtoN) found in your svn trunk(http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/pig/trunk/test/org/apache/pig/test/pigunit/TestPigTest.java?revision=1662348&view=markup) but I have a lot of problems. First of all I'm trying to run the test under IntelliJ 2016.3 as jUnit. I'm using maven 3 as a build tool and dependency manager. So in your documentation you've written that we only need pig, pigunit and hadoop-common. But this way throws exceptions for missing classes. Then I had to add hadoop-hdfs, hadoop-mapreduce-client-core, hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient in order to resolve this problem(I don't think that this must be that way). But then comes the interesing part- I receive the following error 

org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.FrontendException: ERROR 1066: Unable to open iterator for alias queries_group. I tried to debug it and this happens while trying to build the query plan and acquire the ExecJob. I even tried to simplify the script and remove everything but the code for loading and storing the data. The result was the same. So I'm almost desperate and I hope someone can help me with this.

Cheers,
Plamen
