This is a follow-up JIRA to PIG-2582. ResourceStatistics should be improved and a few things we should do for 0.13. 

1. Consider removing method setmBytes(Long mBytes). We deprecated this method in 0.12, but the code does not seem intuitive as the setter is actually working on the variable "bytes".

2. All setter methods return ResourceStatistics object and this is unnecessary. For eg:

public ResourceStatistics setNumRecords(Long numRecords) {
        this.numRecords = numRecords;
        return this;
    }



Each one of these variables has an associated getter.

I will take this up once we are in the 0.13 cycle.
