Currently the sample map reduce job in order by implementation does the following:

	sample 100 records from each map
	group all on the above output
	sort the output bag from the above grouping on keys of the order by
	give the sorted bag to FindQuantiles udf




The steps 2 and 3 above can be replaced by

	group the sample output by the order by key and set parallelism of the group to 1 so that output of the group goes to one reducer. Since Hadoop ensures the output of the group is sorted by key we get sorting for free without using POSort
