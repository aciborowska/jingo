 'ant test'  under svn base dir for pig is running zebra tests, but several tests are failing unless it is started after 'ant clean' . 
It seems like the wrong directory (/homes/tejas/branch-0.8/build/contrib/zebra/test/logs) is being cleaned and the files that are left behind cause this problem.
The failed test case stack trace have error message like  "Caused by: java.io.IOException: ColumnGroup.Writer constructor failed : Index meta file already exists: org.apache.hadoop.zebra.pig.TestOrderPreserveVariableTable.test_union_as_input1/CG0/.meta"
