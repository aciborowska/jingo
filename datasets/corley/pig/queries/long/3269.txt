This is another language improvement using the same approach as in PIG-3268.

Currently, Pig has no support for IN operator. To mimic it, users often have to concatenate several OR operators.

For example,

a = LOAD '1.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (i:int);
b = FILTER a BY 
   (i == 1) OR
   (i == 22) OR
   (i == 333) OR
   (i == 4444) OR
   (i == 55555);


But this can be re-rewritten in a more compact manner using IN operator as follows: 

a = LOAD '1.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (i:int);
b = FILTER a BY i IN (1,22,333,4444,55555);


I propose that we implement IN operator in the following manner:

	Add built-in UDFs that take expressions as args. Take for example the aforementioned IN operator, we can define a UDF such as builtInUdf(i, 1, 22, 333, 4444, 55555).
	Add syntactical sugar for these built-in UDFs.
