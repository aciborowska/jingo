As brought up in the pig user mailing list (http://www.mail-archive.com/user%40pig.apache.org/msg00606.html) Pig does sometime not scan the full HBase table.
It seems that HBaseStorage has problems scanning large tables. It issues just one mapper job instead of one mapper job per table region.
Ian Stevens, who brought this issue up in the mailing list, attached a script to reproduce the problem (https://gist.github.com/766929).
However, in my case, the problem only occurred, after the table was split into more than one regions.
