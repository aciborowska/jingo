In PIG-4802, we determine different parallelism factors for different successors (edges).
For eg: If we have two successors, one with combine plan and other without
we want to compute lesser parallelism factor for the one with the combine plan
as that edge will get less data.

To be more perfect, we need only look at the split sub-plan that
writes to that successor edge. If there is a FILTER in one sub-plan it is accounted
for all the successors now which is not right.
