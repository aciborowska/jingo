When an operator is printed in pig, it prints a string with the user name and date at which the grunt shell was started. This information is not useful and makes the output very verbose.
For example, a line in explain is like -
ForEach tejas-Thu Mar 19 11:25:23 PDT 2009-4 Schema: 
{themap: map[ ]}
 Type: bag

I am proposing that it should change to -
ForEach (id:4) Schema: 
{themap: map[ ]}
 Type: bag

That string comes from scope in OperatorKey class. We don't use make use of it anywhere, so we should stop printing it. The change is only in OperatorKey.toString();
