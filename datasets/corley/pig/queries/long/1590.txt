C = join A by $0 left, B by $0 using 'merge';

will result in map-side sort merge join. Internally, it will translate to use POMergeCogroup + ForEachFlatten. POMergeCogroup places quite a few restrictions on its loaders (A and B in this case) which is cumbersome. Currently, only Zebra is known to satisfy all those requirements. It will be better to use POMergeJoin in this case, since it has far fewer requirements on its loader. Importantly, it works with PigStorage.  Plus, POMergeJoin will be faster then POMergeCogroup + FE-Flatten.
