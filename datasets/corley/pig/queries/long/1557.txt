I have a simple script:

A = load '/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k' as (name, age, gpa);
B = group A by name;
C = foreach B generate group, COUNT(A);
D = order C by $1;
E = limit D 10;
dump E;

I noticed a couple of issues with alias to job mapping: neither load(A) nor limit(E) shows in the output
