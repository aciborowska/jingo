Currently Expression only support BinaryExpressions and Constants. Most of the other logical expressions (cast, udf) need not be pushed down. But, it would make sense to be able to pushdown is null and not operations (possibly negativeexpression).
This change would have impact on LoadFunc's (hcatloader), we need to be careful and make sure we do this in a backwards compatible way.
