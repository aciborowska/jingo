Currently, the parser for queries is in ANTLR, but Grunt is still javacc. The parser is very difficult to work with, and next to impossible to understand or modify. ANTLR provides a much cleaner, more standard way to generate parsers/lexers/ASTs/etc, and moving from javacc to Grunt would be huge as we continue to add features to Pig.
