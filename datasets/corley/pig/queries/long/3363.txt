I have a use case of adding unique values for individual columns of a row. I defined a unique macro to compute the unique value for the given column.

If i call the macro within the script in a single line I'm getting unable to create MR Plan exception

ex: 
define unique(col_name)
returns result{
$result =col_name+'unq';
}
A = load 'logs.txt' as (id:chararray,name:chararray);
B = foreach A generate unique('A::id') as unq_id, unique('A::name') as unq_name;

Where as when I have the macro calling code seperately it is running fine
