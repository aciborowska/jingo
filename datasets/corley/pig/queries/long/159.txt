In order to support the new types functionality described in http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigTypesFunctionalSpec, the parse needs to change in the following ways:

1) AS needs to support types in addition to aliases.  So where previously it was legal to say:

a = load 'myfile' as a, b, c;

it will now also be legal to say

a = load 'myfile' as a integer, b float, c chararray;

2) Non string constants need to be supported.  This includes non-string atomic types (integer, long, float, double) and the non-atomic types bags, tuples, and maps.

3) A cast operator needs to be added so that fields can be explicitly casted.

4) Changes to DEFINE, to allow users to declare arguments and return types for UDFs
