Many of the pig source files mix tabs and 4 spaces for indentation.  This is particularly painful for me when reading the code as I've set up my editor to indent tabs 8 spaces so I can catch if I actually use them anywhere, and the source jumps back and forth in indentation level, sometimes from line to line.

The patch replaces all tabs with 4 spaces in java code since that's what's mentioned as the standard in the wiki.
