Currently, you can embed Pig in Python, Ruby, Groovy, and Javascript. However you are unable to specify a custom Scripting Engine that deals with Pig embedded in something else.

To solve this, Pig can either have a command-line option that specifies which scripting engine to use for running the provided file, or support should be added for something like the following syntax on the first line of a file:
#@ <FQCN of Script Engine>
that forces Pig to use the specified Scripting Engine to read the file.
