We are using PigServer directly to run pig scripts as part of workflow.

It looks like setbatchmodeon(true) can't be used with this registerScript(String fileName, Map<String,String> params).

I am not sure why the pigserver implementation doesnt match grunt shell implementation.

Also you need to call pigserver.store method.

This makes MultiQuery option not possible with PigServer with registerPigScript?
