If we can detect parse/lexical/syntax/etc. issues before running a script we can save user/cluster time. Occasionally this results in a long script failing in the middle because of a simple detectable typo and wasting time/processing power. This issue can serve as holder of several examples and levels we can tackle this. 

There were some discussions regarding having save-points/check-points so script can resume from a failed point. That goes in a separate issue.

Please go ahead and add your examples.
