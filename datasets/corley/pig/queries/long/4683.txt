The following script fail after PIG-3591.

a = load '1.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (a0:chararray, a1:chararray);
b = load '2.txt' as (b0:chararray);
c = cogroup b by b0, a by a0;
d = foreach c {
    a_sorted = order a by a1 desc;
    generate group, a_sorted, b;
}
dump d;


1.txt
a,0
a,2
a,1

2.txt
a

Expected:

(a,{(a,1),(a,2),(a,0)},{(a)})


Actual:

(a,{(a,2),(a,1),(a,0),(a)},{})
