I ran the following script:

Input data:

joe     100
sam     20
bob     134

Script:

A = load 'user_clicks' as (user: chararray, clicks: int);
B = group A by user;
C = foreach A generate group, SUM(A.clicks);
D = foreach A generate clicks/(double)C.$1;
dump C;

Since C contains more than 1 tuple, I expected to get an error which I did. However, the error was not very clear. When the job failed, I did see a valid error (however it lacked the error code): 210630 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.pigstats.PigStats  - ERROR 0: Scalar has more than one row in the output
 However at the end of processing, I saw a misleading error:

210709 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt  - ERROR 2088: Unable to get results for: hdfs://wilbur20.labs.corp.sp1.yahoo.com:9020/tmp/temp818551960/tmp1063730945:org.apache.pig.impl.io.InterStorage
