This is one of the very frequently used patterns


grouped_data_set = group data_set by id;

capped_data_set = foreach grouped_data_set
{
  ordered = order joined_data_set by timestamp desc;
  capped = limit ordered $num;
 generate flatten(capped);
};



But this performs very poorly when there are millions of rows for a key in the groupby with lot of spills.  This can be easily optimized by pushing the limit into the InternalSortedBag and maintain only $num records any time and avoid memory pressure.
