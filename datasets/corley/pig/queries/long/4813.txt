Hi Team,

I couldn't get the schema loading for AvroStorage as described in http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-etl-avro.html working. 

It works fine if I provide the raw schema string with option 'schema' as described in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PIG/AvroStorage.

On HDFS I don't even need to specify the schema with store command.

A quick insights regarding the versions.

	Hadoop :

Hadoop 2.6.0-amzn-2
Subversion git@aws157git.com:/pkg/Aws157BigTop -r 41f4e6be3ac5d6676a3464f77de79a33e8fdd9f3
Compiled by ec2-user on 2015-11-16T20:56Z
Compiled with protoc 2.5.0


	Pig :

Apache Pig version 0.14.0-amzn-0 (r: unknown)


	piggybank jar version:
	
		piggybank-0.14.0.jar
	
	
	avro jar version :
	
		avro-1.7.7.jar
	
	
	avro-ipc jar version :
	
		avro-ipc-1.7.7.jar
	
	
	json-simple jar version
	
		json-simple-1.1.jar
	
	



I tried looking for any pibbybank version of jar for EMR however no luck. I fear I am not using correct versions of jars since the feature should work as it has been documented. 

Please advise if I am missing anything.

Thanks,
Jagdish
