Currently, Pig's progress estimation is based on the percentage of jobs completed out of the total number of MR jobs. However, since the MR operators are arranged in a DAG (and hence more than 1 job might be submitted for execution in parallel), the progress estimation can be improved by considering the number of jobs in the critical path, instead of just the total number of jobs.
