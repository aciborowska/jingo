With pig.opt.bytecode=true with PIG-5256, TestScriptLanguage.runParallelTest2, Jython_CompileBindRun_3 fail with following error

 java.lang.LinkageError: loader (instance of  org/apache/pig/impl/PigContext$ContextClassLoader): attempted  duplicate class definition for name: "org/apache/pig/backend/hadoop/executionengine/physicalLayer/relationalOperators/POForEach_scope_6"


 Since NodeIdGenerator is ThreadLocal, running same script in parallel with different parameters using embedded Python causes conflict in the name of class files generated. Conflicts need to be handled in

	PigContext classloader by making it ThreadLocal
	Class files should have another identifier to differentiate between multiple scripts.
