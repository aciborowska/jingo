On the one hand side Pig uses commons logging - what makes sense. On the other hand side the Pig Main class configure Log4j in the code. This introduce a log4j must have dependency. 
I suggest to only use a log4j configuration file to configure log4j and remove the log4j configuration in the code. 
Any thoughts?
