It would be nice to revisit the AvroStorage, possibly related to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-3015 to work with the union type via Avro. 

In discussions with Cheolsoo, a possible fix could be similar to recursive records (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-2875) utilization of a bytearray could be flexible enough to work, but does place the burden on the developer.
