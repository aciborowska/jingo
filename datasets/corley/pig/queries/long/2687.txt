The idea is to add a real notion of scope that can be used to manage namespace. This would mean the addition of blocks to pig, probably with some sort of syntax like this...

a = load thing as (x:int, y:int);
b = foreach a generate x, y, x*y as z;
{
  a = group b by z;
  b = foreach a generate COUNT(b);
  global b;
}



which would replace the alias b with the nested b value in the scope. This could also be used in nested foreach blocks, and macros could just become blocks as well.

I am 95% sure about how to implement this... I have a failed patch attempt, and need to study a bit more about how Pig uses its logical operators.

Any thoughts?
