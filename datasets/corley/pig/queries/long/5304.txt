There is no way to build Pig with Hadoop 2.8 due to 

    [javac] /code/build/pig/rpm/BUILD/pig-0.15.0-src/src/org/apache/pig/backend/hadoop/datastorage/HDataStorage.java:33: error: cannot find symbol
    [javac] import org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DistributedFileSystem;
    [javac]                              ^
    [javac]   symbol:   class DistributedFileSystem
    [javac]   location: package org.apache.hadoop.hdfs

That trouble was caused by HDFS-8740

So we need to add hadoop-hdfs-client as dependency. 

I'll upload patch shortly.
