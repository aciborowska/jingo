It would be nice to have a FilterFunc that allows to filter based on a tuple in the stream being part of either another tuple of a bag. 

Data (e.g. session data joined with e.g. follow-up sessions where)
> BAG: 
{('/login'), ('/show'), ('/logout?user_id=2000')}
, TUPLE: ('/logout?user_id=2000')
> BAG: 
{('/home'), ('/about')}
, TUPLE: ('/admin')
> BAG: 
{('login')}
, TUPLE: ('/logout')

It would be great to be able to filter filter based on criteria <B1 CONTAINS  T1> or <T1 CONTAINS T2>. In the above case, the only result of such an operation would be the first entry '/logout?user_id=2000' - it should be obvious that this is useful.
