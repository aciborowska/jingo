When using PigServer to execute pig scripts, multiple store statements in a single pig script result in multiple pig jobs getting created.

In earlier versions only on pig job would be created for a pig script even there were multiple store statements in the script.

It looks like batch mode changes affected this 

0.10.0
            pigServer.setBatchOn();
            pigServer.registerScript(pigScript, params);
            List<ExecJob> pigJobs = pigServer.executeBatch();

this would create only one pig job 

in version 0.12.0

           pigServer.setBatchOn();
            pigServer.registerScript(pigScript, params);
            List<ExecJob> pigJobs = pigServer.executeBatch(true);

create multiple pig jobs instead of one and taking longer.
