/**

	Build a bloom filter for use later in Bloom.  This UDF is intended to run
	in a group all job.  For example:
	define bb BuildBloom('jenkins', '100', '0.1');
	A = load 'foo' as (x, y);
	B = group A all;
	C = foreach B generate BuildBloom(A.x);
	store C into 'mybloom';
	The bloom filter can be on multiple keys by passing more than one field
	(or the entire bag) to BuildBloom.
	The resulting file can then be used in a Bloom filter as:
	define bloom Bloom(mybloom);
	A = load 'foo' as (x, y);
	B = load 'bar' as (z);
	C = filter B by Bloom(z);
	D = join C by z, A by x;
	It uses 
{@link org.apache.hadoop.util.bloom.BloomFilter}
.
