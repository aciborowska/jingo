Saw UT failures in TestPigScriptParser and TestTezGraceParallelism on 0.16 branch and trunk. 

TestTezGraceParallelism failures are introduced by PIG-4884. The vertex output data size is larger since DistinctCombiner does not do column projection. Also due to the plan change, the vertex name also changed.
