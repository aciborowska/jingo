LoadPushDown.pushProjection(..) should support nested schemas. Currently the RequiredFieldList passed to this method only include the top-level fields so more granular projection at a lower level is not supported.

The data model already support this, since RequiredField.getSubFields() exists, but subfields are not currently set. I'm not sure if this JIRA is a Bug that these fields aren't set, or if it's an Improvement to set them.
