There are a number of commands that can be used in Pig scripts that will trigger an executeBatch() from GruntParser during parsing. This can cause multiple runs of identical (non-shared) jobs. Consider this script:


A = ...
B = ...
C = ...

STORE C

rmf 'xyz'

D = JOIN C, A
STORE D



The DAG of jobs produced by A,B,C will run twice due to the executeBatch() call tied to the rmf statement. Instead we should insert a marker into the plan for these types of operations and execute them from the JobControlCompiler at the appropriate time.

A quick look of the code shows the following commands currently trigger executeBatch:


	cat
	move
	cp
	copyToLocal
	copyFromLocal
	rmf
	exec
	fs command
	sh command
	SQL command
