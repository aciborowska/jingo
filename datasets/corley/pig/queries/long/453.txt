Currently, the scope resolution operator :: is stored as part of the field schema alias. As a result, users may get confused by queries like:


a = load 'st10k' as (name, age, gpa);
b = group a by name;
c = foreach b generate flatten(a);
d = filter c by name != 'fred';
e = group d by name;
f = foreach e generate flatten(d);
g = foreach f generate name;



With PIG-451, the schema for f will have a column with aliases a::name and d::a::name. The use of d::a::name is particularly confusing.
