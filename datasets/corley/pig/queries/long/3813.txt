When the following script is run, pig goes into an infinite loop. This was reproduced on pig trunk as of March 12, 2014 on apache hadoop 1.2. test_data.txt has been attached. 

test.pig
tWeek = LOAD '/tmp/test_data.txt' USING PigStorage ('|') AS (WEEK:int, DESCRIPTION:chararray, END_DATE:chararray, PERIOD:int);

gTWeek = FOREACH tWeek GENERATE WEEK AS WEEK, PERIOD AS PERIOD;

pWeek = FILTER gTWeek BY PERIOD == 201312;

pWeekRanked = RANK pWeek BY WEEK ASC DENSE;

gpWeekRanked = FOREACH pWeekRanked GENERATE $0;
store gpWeekRanked into 'gpWeekRanked';
describe gpWeekRanked;
---------------------------------------------------

The res object of class Result, gets its value from leaf.getNextTuple()
This gets an empty tuple 
() 
with STATUS_OK.

SO the while(true) condition never gets an End of Processing (EOP) and so does not exit.
