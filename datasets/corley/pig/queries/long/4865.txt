While trying to run lipstick on the production cluster I got this error:

ERROR 2998: Unhandled internal error. tried to access method org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TaskReport.downgrade(Lorg/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/TaskReport;)Lorg/apache/hadoop/mapred/TaskReport; from class org.apache.hadoop.mapred.DowngradeHelper$TaskReportIterator

I looked for the TaskReport class and the DowngradeHelper class, I found that  DowngradeHelper is accessing  the method downgrade() which is a static method and package level accessible only.
