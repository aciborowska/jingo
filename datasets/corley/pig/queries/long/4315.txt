TestHBaseStorage.testMergeJoin() fails. connectingLR is null in CombinerOptimizer and throws NPE in 


from.plan.getOperator(connectingLR.getOperatorKey())



When splitting DAGs and doing moveTree TezCompilerUtil.connect() overwrites the output key of sampler LocalRearrange to the partitioner vertex.

Split followed by orderby also had issues using the same TezCompilerUtil.connect()  method.
