I want to use HBaseStorage without specifying the schema. Storing data in Avro format in HBase is a very common practice. I would like to create a UDF, HBaseAvroStorage that works just like the internal HBaseStorage UDF, but loads the Avro schema metadata so that specifying a schema is unnecessary.

I haven't thought through all the particulars, so if you have - please chime in 

I am also not sure if this isn't sort of handled some place in HCatalog?
