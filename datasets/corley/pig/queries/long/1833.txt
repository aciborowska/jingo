As discovered in testing PIG-1748, the build.xml in the contrib/piggybank/java module has junit.hadoop..conf which points to "${user.home}/pigtest/conf/".  In this directory is a hadoop-conf.xml that defines a value for fs.default.name which is valid during the regular test runs but not for the contrib modules.  However, any tests in contrib that try to access a non-fully qualified file via FileSystem will be routed to this value and will then fail when they can't reach it.  If, however, one runs the tests directly from contrib module without the pigtest directory existing, the tests will pass.  Do any of the contrib modules actually need this variable?  If not, it should be removed.
