Currently the TOMAP function only supports a parameter list of values.

I want to convert a bag of tuples to a map with specific value in each tuple as key. Basically I want to change:
{(id1, value1),(id2, value2), ...} into [id1#value1, id2#value2]

I propose to make the TOMAP accept both the current form

TOMAP($0, $1, $2, $3)

and a new form where the a single parameter: 
A bag of Tuples where each Tuple has exactly two fields: a "key" and a "value".
