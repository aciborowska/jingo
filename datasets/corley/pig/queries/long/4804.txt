Below are steps fro recreating the issue.
1). take sample numbers in a file.
cat >numbers.txt
12
11
111
21
111
21
ctrl+z
2). upload numbers file to a folder
hdfs dfs -put numbers.txt /user/hdfs/numbers
3). Run below pig latin script
help = load '/user/hdfs/numbers';
dump help;

If we use reserved words Pig latin has to throw an error. 

if we use help word ,it successfully completes job and in the end it prints help page.

am I missing anything here?
