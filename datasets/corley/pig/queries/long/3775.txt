When implementing Pig union, we need to gather data from two or more upstream vertexes without sorting. The vertex itself might consists of several tasks. Same can be done for the partitioner vertex in orderby and skewed join instead of 1-1 edge for some cases of parallelism.

TEZ-661 has been created to add custom output and input for that in Tez. It is currently not in the Tez team priorities but it is important for us as it will give good performance gains. We can write the custom input/output and contribute it to Tez and make the corresponding changes in Pig. 

This is a candidate project for Google summer of code 2014. More information about the program can be found at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PIG/GSoc2014
