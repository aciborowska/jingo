I see that in UDFS VALUELIST/VALUESET we wrap every element in a tuple no matter the type of element, which means that we may  wrap a tuple inside a tuple if the input map contains tuples as values. In our Pig loaders we specifically do not do this, when converting to DataBags we do not wrap elements in tuples which are tuple equivalents. I wondering if this is the intended behavior or is it a bug?
