Currently 'register' can only be done inside a Pig Latin script.  Users often run their scripts in different environments, so jar locations or versions may change.  But they don't want to edit their script to fit each environment.  Instead they could register on the command line, something like:

pig -Dpig.additional.jars=my.jar:your.jar script.pig

These would not override registers in the Pig Latin script itself.
