  Parquest supports predicate evaluation and filtering of records natively via https://github.com/apache/incubator-parquet-mr/blob/master/parquet-column/src/main/java/parquet/filter2/predicate/FilterApi.java. It would be good to have it in ORC Reader as well but is not available right now. So evaluate the predicate pushdown condition in OrcStorage itself and filter records. This requires PIG-4093.
