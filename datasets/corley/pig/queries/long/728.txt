The current error handling framework logs backend error messages only when Pig is not able to parse the error message. Instead, Pig should log the backend error message irrespective of Pig's ability to parse backend error messages. On a side note, the use of instantiateFuncFromSpec in Launcher.java is not consistent and should avoid the use of class_name + "(" + string_constructor_args + ")".
