Add this task for myself to update the documents for unit testing with the local mini hadoop cluster when the change for that feature has been committed.  The documents that need to be updated include:

	The " HowToContribute"  document (http://wiki.apache.org/pig/HowToContribute)
	The "Pig Test Frame" document.
What else?
