Brief notes about the pig.pl, and a patch to resolve some of these

1. Is conf/pigclient.conf really required?
pig.pl dies straight away if $ROOT/conf/pigclient.conf does not exist. 
This is a shame, for a couple of reasons:

	the only really necessary detail in pigclient.conf is $pigJarRoot.
	$pigJarRoot, $hodRoot and $defaultCluster can be set using
pigclient.conf - why cant they also be:
    (a) worked out from defaults ? - eg $pigJarRoot
     my $JAR = $0;#/scripts/pig.pl
      $JAR =~ s/pig\.pl/..\/pig.jar/
    (b) $hodRoot - seem an obvious example to be configurable using the 
command line arguments?
    (c) $defaultCluster - ditto?




	if conf/pigclient.conf doesnt exist, pig.pl dies before the --help options can displayed (big shame)
    -> means that scripts/pig.pl -h doesnt work out the box as well as most of
    http://wiki.apache.org/pig/GettingStarted




	As far as I can see minimum setup for a new Pig user:
cd pig
(ant)
mkdir conf
echo "\$pigJarRoot = \"$PWD\"" > conf/pigclient.conf
mkdir -p libexec/pig//released/
cp pig.jar libexec/pig//released/
ROOT=$PWD scripts/pig.pl
or specify the class path manually.



2. Java binary is looked for in a special Yahoo place or in PATH, but 
JAVA_HOME is not checked, as per other common startup scripts (eg Tomcat).


3. looking for java in the path

`which java 2>&1 > /dev/null`;
if ($? != 0) {

I cant help thinking that this would be better/quicker in Perl:
sub inpath
{
    my $bin = shift;
    foreach my $dir (split /:/, $ENV
{PATH}
)
    {
       return 1 if -e $dir/$bin;
    }
    return 0;
}

If this is deemed desirable, I can update the patch for this sub-issue too.

Please find attached a patch for pig.pl that resolves issues 1 & 2. This 
will allow the GettingStarted documentation to perform as expected 
without all the rigmarole associated with pigclient.conf
