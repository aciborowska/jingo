Pig looses floating point precision during conversion between binary and string conversion.
Here is an example code.

words = LOAD '/user/daeho/words.txt' as (word);
numWords  = FOREACH (GROUP words ALL) GENERATE COUNT($1);
weight = FOREACH numWords GENERATE 1.0 / $0;
wordsWithWeight = CROSS words, weight;
sumWeight = FOREACH (GROUP wordsWithWeight ALL) GENERATE SUM($1.$1);
dump sumWeight;

sumWeight is not 1 even though words.txt has 118 lines.

Can we store floating point as binary format?
