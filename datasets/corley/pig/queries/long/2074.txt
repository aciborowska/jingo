This was raised while looking at PIG-1827

There seems to be a bug in PreprocessorContext:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/pig/trunk/src/org/apache/pig/tools/parameters/PreprocessorContext.java?view=markup


235 	//String litVal = Matcher.quoteReplacement(val);
236 	replaced_line = replaced_line.replaceFirst("\\$"+key, val);



the replacement (2nd) parameter of replaceFirst is not a plain string, it can contain references to the matched pattern like "$0" so $ in val must be escaped.
Does someone know why line 235 is commented out ?
