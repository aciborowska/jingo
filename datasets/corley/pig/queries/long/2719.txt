This is demonstrated by the following simple example.

Notice e and f wrongly describe the name of the first column as y2 rather than y1

1.txt:
1, 2, 3
4, 5, 6
7, 8, 9

a = load '1.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (x:int, y:int, z:int);
b = foreach a generate *;
c = join a by x, b by x;
d = foreach c generate a.y as y1, b.y as y2;

describe d;
d: 
{y1: int,y2: int}

e = foreach d generate y1, y2;

describe e;
e: 
{y2: int,y2: int}

f = foreach e generate y1;

describe f;
f: 
{y2: int}
