pig hangs on the last line on the script below when I run with -x local. It runs fine when run on hadoop.
see attached tarball for repro details. 
I initially ran into a problem which involved cogrouping two things like id_docdate_s1 below, but this is what I came up with while tightening down my bugreport.
Thanks in advance!  -MN

DEFINE get_doc_date `document-date.pl`;

id_text1 = LOAD 'v2.txt' AS (id,text);
id_docdate1 = STREAM id_text1 THROUGH  get_doc_date AS (id,docdate);
id_docdate_s1 = ORDER id_docdate1 BY docdate;
store id_docdate_s1 into 'f1.out';

id_text2 = LOAD 'v2.txt' AS (id,text);
id_docdate2 = STREAM id_text2 THROUGH  get_doc_date AS (id,docdate);
id_docdate_s2 = ORDER id_docdate2 BY docdate;
store id_docdate_s2 into 'f2.out';    – second store call hangs pig
