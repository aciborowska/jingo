As part of the explanation of the new DateTime datatype I noticed that we had added a CurrentTime() UDF. The issue with this UDF is that it returns the current time of every exec invocation, which can lead to confusing results. In PIG-1431 I proposed a way such that every instance of the same NOW() will return the same time, which I think is better. Would enjoy thoughts.
