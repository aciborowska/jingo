The simplest example of the failure of the current string interpolation is 


store my_rel into '$OUTPUT_';



This will raise an error saying that OUTPUT_ is not a variable passed in. Similar errors happen with a variety of other trailing characters.

It would be nice if '${OUTPUT}_', or something similar, worked.
