For a script with globbing on register followed by multi-line comments, parameter substitution doesn't work.
test.pig
register /Users/knoguchi/mydir/*.jar; 

A = load '$input' as (a1:int);
/* comment here */
store A into '$output';




Trying to run this would result in 

org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecException: ERROR 2118: Input path does not exist: file:/Users/knoguchi/git/pig/$input


Running with -dryrun, we can see that parameter between the globbing and the multi-line style comment is ignored. 


% pig -dryrun  -param input=input.txt -param output=output.txt  test.pig
...

register /Users/knoguchi/mydir/*.jar;

A = load '$input' as (a1:int);
/* comment here */
store A into 'output.txt';
