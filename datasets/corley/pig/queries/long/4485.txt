When reading parquet files with "order by":

a = load '/xxx/xxx/parquet/xxx.parquet' using ParquetLoader();
b = order a by col1 ;
c = limit b 100 ;
dump c



Pig spawns a Sampler job always in the begining:

Job Stats (time in seconds):
JobId	Maps	Reduces	MaxMapTime	MinMapTIme	AvgMapTime	MedianMapTime	MaxReduceTime	MinReduceTime	AvgReduceTime	MedianReducetime	Alias	Feature	Outputs
job_1426804645147_1270	1	1	8	8	8	8	4	4	4	4	b	SAMPLER
job_1426804645147_1271	1	1	10	10	10	10	4	4	4	4	b	ORDER_BY,COMBINER
job_1426804645147_1272	1	1	2	2	2	2	4	4	4	4	b		hdfs:/tmp/temp-xxx/tmp-xxx,



The issue is when reading lots of files, the first sampler job can take a long time to finish.

The ask is:
1. Is the sampler job a must to implement "order by"?
2. If no, is there any way to disable RandomSampleLoader manually?

Thanks.
