Priority: Trivial 

I noticed this while preparing for a Pig Training session on windows.  

grunt> cat C:/tmp/test88.txt;
1       2       3       4
a       b       c       d
r       s       t       ugrunt>

â€“ meaning the file doesn't have \n and \r in the last line but has those on previous lines. This is to test the difference

grunt> a = load 'C:/tmp/test88.txt';
grunt> dump a;
)1, 2, 3, 4
)a, b, c, d
(r, s, t, u)

 location of ")" and the fact that "(" doesn't show up are the problems.
