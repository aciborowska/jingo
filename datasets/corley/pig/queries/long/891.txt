Several hadoop dfs commands are not support or restrictive on current Pig. We need to fix that. These include:
1. Several commands do not supported: lsr, dus, count, rmr, expunge, put, moveFromLocal, get, getmerge, text, moveToLocal, mkdir, touchz, test, stat, tail, chmod, chown, chgrp. A reference for these command can be found in http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/hdfs_shell.html
2. All existing dfs commands do not support globing.
3. Pig should provide a programmatic way to perform dfs commands. Several of them exist in PigServer, but not all of them.
