Motivation: Why should a user have to supply the fully qualified name to his user defined function, if all the functions he ever uses are in a pre-defined list of packages?

Currently PigContext has a list of Java packages that are searched for functions. Currently the list consists of the following 
packages:

	org.apache.pig.builtin.
	org.apache.pig.impl.builtin.
	com.yahoo.pig.yst.sds.ULT.



Users should be able to add to this packagelist.

Example in Grunt:

include com.pig.function.package.



This has connections to imports in Java classes, namespaces in XQuery, and the PATH env var in shell scripting.

Should be trivial to implement, or could be a property.
