QueryParserUtils.java has the code - 
result.add("hdfs://"thisHost":"+uri.getPort());

I propose to make it generic like - 
result.add(uri.getScheme() + "://"thisHost":"+uri.getPort());

Similarly jobControlCompiler.java has - 
if (!outputPathString.contains("://") || outputPathString.startsWith("hdfs://")) {

 I have a patch version which I ran passing unit tests on. Will be uploading it shortly.
