Even after applying patch for PIG-398, the following query still fails:

a = load 'studenttab10k' as (name, age, gpa);
b = filter a by age < 20;
c = group b by age;
d = foreach c 
{
    cf = filter b by gpa < 3.0;
    cp = cf.gpa;
        cd = distinct cp;
    co = order cd by $0;
    generate group, flatten(co);
    }
store d into 'output';
