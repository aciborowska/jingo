The POCasts resulting from the following scripts have a null load Function reference which leads to run time null pointer exceptions:

Script 1:

a = load 'a' as (s);
b = foreach a generate s#'a' as x;
c = foreach b generate (int) x#'a' as intx;



Script 2:

a = load 'bla' as (s, m, l);
b = foreach a generate s#'x' as f1, s#'y' as f2, s#'z' as f3;
c = group b by f1;
d = foreach c {
    fil = filter b by f2 == 1;
    generate flatten(group), SUM(fil.f3);
    }
