Consider the following Pig script which casts return values of the SQUARE UDF which are  tuples of doubles to long. The describe output of B shows it is long, however the result is still double.

register statistics.jar;
A = load 'myfloatdata.txt' using PigStorage() as (doublecol:double);
B = foreach A generate (tuple(long))statistics.SQUARE(doublecol) as squares:(loadtimesq);
describe B;
explain B;
dump B;


===========================================
Describe output of B:
B: 
{squares: (loadtimesq: long)}
===========================================================
Sample output of B:
((7885.44))
((792098.2200010001))
((1497360.9268889998))
((50023.7956))
((0.972196))
((0.30980356))
((9.9760144E-7))
===========================================================
Cause: The cast for Tuples has not been implemented in POCast.java
