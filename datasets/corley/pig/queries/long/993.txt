A Zebra table is stored as multiple sub tables each containing a set of columns called column group (CG). The user specifies how these columns are grouped while creating a table through the storage hint.

For some of the large tables, it might be necessary for users to remove a set of columns and retain the rest. This jira provides a way for users to delete an entire column group. 

The following comments will have more details on API and the semantics.
