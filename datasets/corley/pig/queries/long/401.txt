The splitIntroducer does not handle the following cases correctly:

	As soon as SplitIntroducer sees an operator which does NOT have multiple outputs it stops - it should still recursively check the successors:
Current code which needs to change:

        List<LogicalOperator> sucs = mPlan.getSuccessors(root);
        if(sucs==null) return; 
        int size = sucs.size();
        if(size==0 || size==1) return;  --> THIS should change to recursively process the succesor if it exists(size == 1 case)






	If there are more than one operators in the plan which need implicit splits to be introduced
	If the new SPLIT operator is introduced before a cogroup, the cogroup's inner map for it's inputs and GroupBy expressions needs to be updated
	The kind of changes need for cogroup maybe needed for some other operators



I started looking at it some and have a patch for the first two issues - UNTESTED which I am attaching to this issue
