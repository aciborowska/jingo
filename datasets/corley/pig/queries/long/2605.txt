In absence of this feature, user is forced to register all the internal dependencies which LF/SF/UDF have. Hard part is not to do register itself, but to figure out dependencies LF/SF have which is non-trivial since user has not written those LF/SF/UDF herself.

Perhaps, this will be considered in UDF/LF/SF redesign.
