Most joda-time releases update DateTimeZone data (timezone database) to recent version - http://www.joda.org/joda-time/upgradeto293.html. Should use latest version in Pig every time we make a release so that timezone related calculations are up to date and provide correct results. Just had one cause where there was wrong result because hcatalog's joda-time-2.5.jar was picked over Pig's joda-time-2.8.2.jar when both conflicted in classpath. Will get hive folks also to update.
