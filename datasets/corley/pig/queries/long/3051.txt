Had a user hitting 
"Caused by: java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 1, Size: 1" error when he had multiple stores and limit in his code.

I couldn't reproduce this with short pig code (due to ColumnPruning somehow not happening when shortened), but here's a snippet. 


...
G3 = FOREACH G2 GENERATE sortCol, FLATTEN(group) as label, (long)COUNT(G1) as cnt;
G4 = ORDER G3 BY cnt DESC PARALLEL 25;
ONEROW = LIMIT G4 1;
U1 = FOREACH ONEROW GENERATE 3 as sortcol, 'somelabel' as label, cnt;
store U1 into 'u1' using PigStorage();
store G4 into 'g4' using PigStorage();



With '-t ColumnMapKeyPrune', job didn't hit the error.
