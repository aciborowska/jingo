There is no current Rule that is affected by this 
but inside TestNewPlanRule.java


155     public void testMultiNode() throws Exception {
...
175          pattern.connect(op1, op3);
176          pattern.connect(op2, op3);
...
178          Rule r = new SillyRule("basic", pattern);
179          List<OperatorPlan> l = r.match(plan);
180          assertEquals(1, l.size());



but this test fail when we swap line 175 and 176 even though they are structurally equivalent.
