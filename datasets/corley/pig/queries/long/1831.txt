The below script when run in local mode gives me a different output. It looks like in local mode I have to store a relation obtained through streaming in order to use it afterwards.

 For example consider the below script : 

DEFINE MySTREAMUDF `test.sh`;
A  = LOAD 'myinput' USING PigStorage() AS (myId:chararray, data2, data3,data4 );
B = STREAM A THROUGH MySTREAMUDF AS (wId:chararray, num:int);
--STORE B into 'output.B';
C = JOIN B by wId LEFT OUTER, A by myId;
D = FOREACH C GENERATE B::wId,B::num,data4 ;
D = STREAM D THROUGH MySTREAMUDF AS (f1:chararray,f2:int);
--STORE D into 'output.D';
E = foreach B GENERATE wId,num;
F = DISTINCT E;
G = GROUP F ALL;
H = FOREACH G GENERATE COUNT_STAR(F) as TotalCount;
I = CROSS D,H;
STORE I  into 'output.I';


test.sh
---------
#/bin/bash
cut -f1,3


And input is 
abcd    label1  11      feature1
acbd    label2  22      feature2
adbc    label3  33      feature3


Here if I store relation B and D then everytime i get the result  :
acbd            3
abcd            3
adbc            3

But if i dont store relations B and D then I get an empty output.  Here again I have observed that this behaviour is random ie sometimes like 1out of 5 runs there will be output.
