The InternalSortedBag(int bagCount, Comparator<Tuple> comp) constructor doesn't properly pass bagCount to the three-arg constructor.

Fixing this issue may have an effect on POSort.java line 268 which uses the two-arg constructor but the specified bagCount (3) is being ignored and the default (1) is used instead.
