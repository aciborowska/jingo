while following the example on pig wiki - 

a = load '/mapred/history/done' using HadoopJobHistoryLoader() as (j:map[], m:map[], r:map[]);
b = foreach a generate (Chararray) j#'STATUS' as status, j#'PIG_SCRIPT_ID' as id, j#'USER' as user, j#'JOBNAME' as script_name, j#'JOBID' as job;
c = filter b by status != 'SUCCESS';
dump c;

when tried to parse /mapred/history logs, it fails to parse the job conf logs because in hadoop 1 the logs are stored as 

job_201310301419_0001_conf.xml

rathar than as per the code says line number 203 in hadoopjobhistoryloader.java 

Path parent = full.getParent();
                String jobXml = jobDetails[0] + "" + jobDetails[1] + ""
                        + jobDetails[2] + "" + jobDetails[3] + ""
                        + jobDetails[4] + "_conf.xml";
                Path p = new Path(parent, jobXml);  

attaching the patch
