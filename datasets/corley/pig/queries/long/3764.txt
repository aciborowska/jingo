I started a prototype here:
https://github.com/julienledem/pig/compare/trunk...compile_physical_plan

The current physical plan is relatively inefficient at evaluating expressions.
In the context of a better execution engine (Tez, Spark, ...), compiling expressions to bytecode would be a significant speedup.

This is a candidate project for Google summer of code 2014. More information about the program can be found at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PIG/GSoc2014
