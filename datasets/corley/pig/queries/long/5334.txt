Today, there was a request from the foundation to add an Apache event logo to our Apache Pig site.
 Details at http://apache.org/events/README.txt
 Basically asking us to add
 https://www.apache.org/events/current-event-234x60.png
 or
 https://www.apache.org/events/current-event-125x125.png
 to our site.

Besides from this, email mentioned about general apache site suggestion outlined at https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs#navigation

	"License" should link to: http://www.apache.org/licenses/
	"Sponsorship" or "Donate" should link to:   http://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html
	"Thanks" should link to: http://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html
	"Security" should link to either to a project-specific page detailing how users may securely report potential vulnerabilities, or to the main http://www.apache.org/security/ page
