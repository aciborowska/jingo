Given the following in a file to Pig, pig doesn't report any error, even if -c option is given:

A = load 'x' as (u, v);
B = foreach A generate $3;

It's questionable whether to validate the query in batch mode as it doesn't contain any store/dump statement. However, if -c option is given, validation should be nevertheless performed.
