Add message at end of each testcase with timestamp in Pig system tests. This will support the generation of application syslog for all failed test cases.

Currently, all Pig system tests print below line while starting test case

Beginning test <testcase> at 1406716992



We also need to print below line at the end of each test case

Ending test <testcase> at 1406717992
