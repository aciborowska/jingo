I have created a RANDOMINT function which generates random numbers between (0 and specified value), For example RANDOMINT(4) gives random numbers between 0 and 3 (inclusive)


$hadoop fs -cat rand.dat
f
g
h
i
j
k
l
m



The pig script is as follows:

register math.jar;
A = load 'rand.dat' using PigStorage() as (data);

B = foreach A {
        r = math.RANDOMINT(4);
        generate
                data,
                r as random,
                ((r == 3)?1:0) as quarter;
        };

dump B;



The results are as follows:

{color:red} 
(f,0,0)
(g,3,0)
(h,0,0)
(i,2,0)
(j,3,0)
(k,2,0)
(l,0,1)
(m,1,0)
{color} 



If you observe, (j,3,0) is created because r is used both in the foreach and generate clauses and generate different values.

Modifying the above script to below solves the issue. The M/R jobs from both scripts are the same. It is just a matter of convenience. 

A = load 'rand.dat' using PigStorage() as (data);

B = foreach A generate
        data,
        math.RANDOMINT(4) as r;

C = foreach B generate
        data,
        r,
        ((r == 3)?1:0) as quarter;

dump C;



Is this issue related to PIG:747?
