PigServer.store(String id, String filename) throws Could not resolve PigStorage exeception. I guess this is because of the the fully qualified class name of PigStorage i.e org.apache.pig.builtin.PigStorage to the PigContext.resolveClassName().

The PigContext.resolveClassName() uses this fully qualified class PigStorage class name and appends with the package names available in the ArrayList returned by getPackageImportList().

And that is why the resolveClassName() could not resolve PigStorage because it is actually searching for org.apache.pig.builtin.org.apache.pig.builtin.PigStorage

I do not know if this is a bug or a requirement.
