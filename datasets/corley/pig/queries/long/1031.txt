I have a data stored in a text file as:

{(4153E765)}
{(AF533765)}


I try reading it using PigStorage as:


A = load 'pigstoragebroken.dat' using PigStorage() as (intersectionBag:bag{T:tuple(term:bytearray)});
dump A;



I get the following results:


({(Infinity)})
({(AF533765)}
)


The problem seems to be with the method: parseFromBytes(byte[] b) in class Utf8StorageConverter. This method uses the TextDataParser (class generated via jjt) to interpret the type of data from content, even though the schema tells it is a bytearray. 

TextDataParser.jjt  sample code

TOKEN :
{
...
 < DOUBLENUMBER: (["-","+"])? <FLOATINGPOINT> ( ["e","E"] ([ "-","+"])? <FLOATINGPOINT> )?>
 < FLOATNUMBER: <DOUBLENUMBER> (["f","F"])? >
...
}



I tried the following options, but it will not work as we need to call bytesToBag(byte[] b) in the Utf8StorageConverter class.

A = load 'pigstoragebroken.dat' using PigStorage() as (intersectionBag:bag{T:tuple(term)});
A = load 'pigstoragebroken.dat' using PigStorage() as (intersectionBag:bag{T:tuple(term:chararray)});
