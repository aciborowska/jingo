If schema for a field of type 'bag' is partially defined then FLATTEN() incorrectly eliminates the field and throws an error. 
Consider the following example:-

A = LOAD 'sample' using PigStorage() as (first:chararray, second:chararray, ladder:bag{});              
B = FOREACH A GENERATE first,FLATTEN(ladder) as third,second;                                   
C = GROUP B by (first,third);

This throws the error
 ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1000: Error during parsing. Invalid alias: third in 
{first: chararray,second: chararray}
