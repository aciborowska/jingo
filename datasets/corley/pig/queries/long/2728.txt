When running Pig scripts through the grunt shell I kept getting Java Heap Space error messages. The cause was that my Hadoop cluster was running 467 map tasks which were being passed down to only 199 reducers. The notice I was getting through the Grunt shell was:

"Neither PARALLEL nor default parallelism is set for this job. Setting number of reducers to 199"

I tried the following commands, none of which worked:

SET DEFAULT_PARALLELISM 2;
SET mapred.reduce.tasks 450;
SET mapred.running.reduce.limit 30;

When I ran the script directly from a file (pig filename.pig) it ran without problems.
