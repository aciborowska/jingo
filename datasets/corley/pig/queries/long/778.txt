The question about how to use the ReversibleLoadStore function came up in 2 scenarios recently:

a) Can we generate a load operator from a store by simply taking the same store function string, if the store function is a ReversibleLoadStore function? I would like to use that to remove unnecessary compiler generated stores, if we can change the depending load operators to load from a different store. 

b) Is it sufficient to check whether a pair of store and load operations on the same location is reversible to know whether we can eliminate it without changing the data? This is done in the pig server for logical plans right now.

If I go by PigStorage then, the answer to (a) is yes. The answer to (b) is no, but we also need to check that both load and store use the same parameter to the reversible function.
