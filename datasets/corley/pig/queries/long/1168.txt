For a map-only job, dump just re-executes every pig-latin statement from the begininng assuming that they would produce same result. the assumption is not valid if there are UDFs that are invoked. Consider the following script:-

raw = LOAD '$input' USING PigStorage() AS (text_string:chararray);
DUMP raw;

ccm = FOREACH raw GENERATE MyUDF(text_string);
DUMP ccm;

bug = FOREACH ccm GENERATE ccmObj;

DUMP bug;

The UDF MyUDF generates a tuple with one of the fields being a randomly generated UUID. So even though one would expect relations 'ccm' and 'bug' to contain identical data, they are different because of re-execution from the begininng. This breaks the application logic.
