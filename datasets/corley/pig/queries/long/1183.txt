Found some minor nits on pig trunk codebase, assigning it to myself.Keeping it open to add few more and close it.

org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecJob.java
Line 78: getContiguration() - should it not be getConfiguration() ?

ivy/pig.pom
Line 47: </exclusions> - Missing ?

A general observation on usage of magic numbers, for eg:
org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.PigSlice.java
Line199: magic number -int errCode = 2094; - can be better framed as new ExecException(msg, UNABLE_TO_DESERIALIZE, PigException.BUG, cnfe) where UNABLE_TO_DESERIALIZE is defined as enum constant 
UNABLE_TO_DESERIALIZE = 2094.
