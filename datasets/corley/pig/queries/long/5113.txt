Hello, I installed Pig on Ubuntu Server 16.0 and I need to use it in local mode.
Yesterday I tried to run some jobs but unfortunately they were killed cause the heap space of java wasn't enough. I updated it but now, when I try to run pig, it appear this error:
Not a valid JAR: /usr/local/pig/pig-0.16.0-core-h2.jar /usr/local/pig/pig-0.16.0-SNAPSHOT-core-h2.jar

How could I solve this? I cannot find a solution.
