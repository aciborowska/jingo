The Dynamic Invokers feature is not documented in official documentation (in pig 0.8). It should be part of the udf documentation, or the page should at least point to the javadoc pages of this family of udfs that help in invoking java functions.

Release notes are present in this jira - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-1551 .
