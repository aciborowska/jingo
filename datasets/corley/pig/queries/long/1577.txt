In the current implementation, functionality that allows to map arguments to classes does not support functions with variable number of arguments. Also it does not support funtions that can have variable (but fixed in number) number of arguments. 

This causes problems for string UDFs such as CONCAT that can take an arbitrary number of arguments or TRIM that can take 1,2, or 3 arguments
