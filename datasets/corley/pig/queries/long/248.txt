Pig Local mode gives wrong results (but Pig + Hadoop give correct results) . This created issues for users who tried to debug in local mode...

Here's my pig code:

a = load '/homes/amiry/tmp/my_test.txt' as (c1,c2,c3);
b = group a by c1;
c = foreach b {
   d = order a by c3;
   generate d;
}
dump c;

Pig + Hadoop: 

(
{(abc, http://www.sss.net, a), (abc, http://www.rrr.com, b)}
)
(
{(def, http://local.yahoo.com/, d), (def, http://lmn.com/, f), (def, http://xyz.com/, g)}
)


Pig Local:
(
{(abc, http://www.sss.net, a), (abc, http://www.rrr.com, b)}
)
({})


Input: 

abc     http://www.rrr.com      b
abc     http://www.sss.net      a
def     http://local.yahoo.com/ d
def     http://lmn.com/ f
def     http://xyz.com/ g
