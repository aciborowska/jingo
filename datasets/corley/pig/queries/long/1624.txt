According to the Pig Latin manual (http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/docs/r0.7.0/piglatin_ref2.html#FOREACH) the correct usage of AS in a FOREACH clause is:


B = foreach A generate $0, $1, $2 as (user, age, gpa);



However, this is incorrect, and produce a syntax error.  The correct syntax for AS for FOREACH is:


B = foreach A generate $0 as user, $1 as age, $2 as gpa;
