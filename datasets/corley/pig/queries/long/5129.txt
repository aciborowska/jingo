In MR, we have a progress bar which tracks the percentage complete of the Pig script. In Tez, we have Tez progress bar in the form of "TotalTasks: 2 Succeeded: 2" for a single DAG. However, we don't track number of DAGs launched. An easy solution for a Tez progress bar is equally distributed percentage across Dags, and within the dag, percentage of task completed.
