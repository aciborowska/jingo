Current code -

for (Job job : jc.getRunningJobs()) {
                    RunningJob runningJob = getJob(job.getJobClient(), job.getAssignedJobID());
                    if (runningJob!=null) {
                        runningJob.killJob();
                        log.info("Job " + job.getAssignedJobID() + " killed");
                    }
                }


is not sufficient for killing all the submitted jobs. It does not kill the jobs that are submitted to the cluster but are in UNDEFINED state (with appid but no app-master).
