I have a Pig script as a template:


register Countwords.jar;
A = $INPUT;
B = FOREACH A GENERATE
examples.udf.SubString($0,0,1),
$1 as num;
C = GROUP B BY $0;
D = FOREACH C GENERATE group, SUM(B.num);
STORE D INTO $OUTPUT;




I attempt to do Parameter substitutions using the following:

Using Shell script:


#!/bin/bash
java -cp ~/pig-svn/trunk/pig.jar:$HADOOP_CONF_DIR org.apache.pig.Main -r -file sub.pig \
             -param INPUT="(foreach (COGROUP(load '/user/viraj/dataset1' USING PigStorage() AS (word:chararray,num:int)) by (word),(load '/user/viraj/dataset2' USING PigStorage() AS (word:chararray,num:int)) by (word)) generate flatten(examples.udf.CountWords(\\$0,\\$1,\\$2)))" \
             -param OUTPUT="\'/user/viraj/output\' USING PigStorage()"




register Countwords.jar;

A = (foreach (COGROUP(load '/user/viraj/dataset1' USING PigStorage() AS (word:chararray,num:int)) by (word),(load '/user/viraj/dataset2' USING PigStorage() AS (word:chararray,num:int)) by (word)) generate flatten(examples.udf.CountWords(runsub.sh,,)));
B = FOREACH A GENERATE
examples.udf.SubString($0,0,1),
$1 as num;
C = GROUP B BY $0;
D = FOREACH C GENERATE group, SUM(B.num);

STORE D INTO /user/viraj/output;



The shell substitutes the $0 before passing it to java. 
a) Is there a workaround for this?  
b) Is this is Pig param problem?
