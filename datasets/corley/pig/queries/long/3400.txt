To reproduce issues, run the following commands w/ S3 paths:

pig -e 'ls s3://<path>'
pig -e 'mkdir s3://<path>'
pig -e 'cp s3://<path1> s3://<path2>'
pig -e 'mv s3://<path1> s3://<path2>'
pig -e 'copyToLocal s3://<path>/<file> .'
pig -e 'copyFromLocal <file> s3://<path>'


As of now, none of these commands works in Apache Pig, whereas they do in EMR Pig. The problem is that in GruntParser, DataStorage is constructed using the default file system provided by configuration, and s3 paths are not recognized.

Instead, we should construct DataStorage based on the given URL. For example,

DataStorage dfs = new HDataStorage(new Path(path).toUri(), mConf);
