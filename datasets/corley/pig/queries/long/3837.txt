To reproduce the issue, run ant pigperf. It fails with the following error-

BUILD FAILED
/Users/cheolsoop/workspace/pig-apache/build.xml:799: The archive sdsuLibJKD12.jar doesn't exist



Although sdsuLibJKD12.jar is checked into trunk (see here). But the path to the jar in build.xml seems broken.

-            <zipfileset src="${lib.dir}/sdsuLibJKD12.jar" />
+            <zipfileset src="test/perf/pigmix/lib/sdsuLibJKD12.jar" />
