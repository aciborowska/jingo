Currently, all the MR properties from Configuration and user defined properties are sync'ed into PigContext's properties member using Utils.recomputeProperties method. This is done in several places in the code and it is kind of the magic behind how configuration works (I removed a little bit of this magic in PIG-3463). We should refactor the code to separate this so that we can improve configuration settings and precedence can be clearly defined.
