User is trying

register jackson_core_asl-1.9.4_1.jar;
register jackson_mapper_asl-1.9.4_1.jar;
register jackson_xc-1.9.4_1.jar;

But pig.jar/pig-withouthadoop.jar has jackson jars and JarManager packages the jackson from pig.jar into job.jar(PIG-2457). We could not find any possible workaround with mapreduce framework to put the user jar first in the classpath as job.jar always takes precedence.

 The pig script works fine with 0.9 and is a regression in 0.10.
