It seems like its a dependency of some jar which Pig pulls in. This results in following warnings while running tests: 

 [junit] WARNING: multiple versions of ant detected in path for junit 
 [junit]          jar:file:/usr/share/ant/lib/ant.jar!/org/apache/tools/ant/Project.class
 [junit]      and jar:file:/home/ashutosh/.ivy2/cache/ant/ant/jars/ant-1.6.5.jar!/org/apache/tools/ant/Project.class



We should configure ivy such that it doesn't download this version of ant, since Pig already has listed ant its direct dependency in ivy and that is version 1.7.1
