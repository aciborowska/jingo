I noticed looking in the PiggyBank LoadFunc classes sometimes there will be cases where the TupleFactory instance is created in the constructor and sometimes there are cases when it's in the getNext() override method. 

Is there a particular reason for this or can I submit a patch to standardize on using it in the constructor across the Loaders?


CSVLoader.java - constructor method
private TupleFactory mTupleFactory = TupleFactory.getInstance();


RegExLoader.java - getNext method
TupleFactory mTupleFactory = DefaultTupleFactory.getInstance();
