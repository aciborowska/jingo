In PIG-2071, we changed the behavior of union on numeric and chararray to bytearray.

This itself was always failing at runtime until we changed to skip the bytearray typecast for union-onschema in PIG-3270.
(For union, it still fails with typecast to bytearray error. )

Now, seeing users getting inconsistent results due to this union-ed bytearray.
