Job jars are largely identical from job to job (just the pig classes and their dependencies). However, there is pigContext in the job jar, and that seems to change from job to job.As a result, the job jars are basically uncacheable in the shared cache. It would be great if we can find a way to separate the pig context and store it in the distributed cache separate from the (stable) job jar. That would give us a better chance to store the job jar.
