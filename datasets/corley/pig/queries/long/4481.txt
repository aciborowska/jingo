ComputeSpec_1, ComputeSpec_2 and StreamingPerformance_3 produce the wrong result on Windows. Since Pig compare the test result with old version of Pig, which also produce wrong result, the test still pass.

The cause of the issue is the parameter passing under Windows. Some parameter of executable cannot pass correctly on Windows. StreamingPerformance_3 requires a simple quoting change and command line change. However, I didn't find a proper way to fix ComputeSpec_1 and ComputeSpec_2 as FS and OFS parameters could not be passed correctly to awk. Changing the test slightly to get around (not changing the intention of the test).
