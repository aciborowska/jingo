When column x is of type bytearray, the semantics of x.$0 is not clear.

We need to define the behavior of this expression in the following cases -
1. Column type is bytearray and the actual object is DataByteArray.
2. Column type is bytearray and the actual object is either a Tuple or DataBag.

When the bytearray column is an object of type DataByteArray, pig runtime tries to cast the object as a tuple and fails with a cast exception.

I am not sure of the current behavior if the bytearray column actually contains a Tuple or DataBag object. (Needs to be tested).


This is related to PIG-1281 .
