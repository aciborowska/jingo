The function SparkLauncher.addJarToSparkJobWorkingDirectory() try to copy the user's Jar files to the working directory. 

when SPARK_MATER == LOCAL, and if the src & dest Jar files have the same absolute path, an exception will be thrown.

Reproduce steps:
1. build pig tutorial
2. cd PIG_HOME/tutorial/pigtmp
    pig -x spark
    REGISTER ./tutorial.jar
    raw = LOAD '/user/excite-small.log' USING PigStorage('\t') AS (user, time, query);
    clean1 = FILTER raw BY org.apache.pig.tutorial.NonURLDetector(query);
    store clean1 into '/user/result1';
