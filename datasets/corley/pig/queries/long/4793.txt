Dear,

I created the simple pig script that reads two avro files, merges the two relations and stores it into the output avro file.

I tried to store output relation into avro file using:
 store outputSet into 'avrostorage' using AvroStorage();

Some workaround was required because pig has problems to process schema with :: (maybe another bug?)

Added code below the result 'avrostorage' file was generated.
outputSet = foreach outputSet generate $0 as (name:chararray) , $1 as (customerId:chararray), $2 as (VIN:chararray) , $3 as (Birthdate:chararray), $4 as (Mileage:chararray) ,$5 as (Fuel_Consumption:chararray);


When I tried to store avro file with the schema definition using code below,
strange error is occurring https://bpaste.net/show/ccf0cbef06a9 (Full log).

...
10.0.1.47:8050 2016-01-29 17:24:39,600 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.pigstats.mapreduce.MRPigStatsUtil - 1 map reduce job(s) failed!
...

STORE outputSet INTO '/avro-dest/Test-20160129-1401822' 
 USING org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.avro.AvroStorage('no_schema_check', 'schema', '....')

I think these might be two important issues, could you please investigate?

Thank you
