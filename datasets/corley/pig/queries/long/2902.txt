This was observed in PIG-2835, where Pig defaults the type used in SUM() as integer while it's actually double, thus parsing each number to integer would throw an exception. PIG-2835 replaced the expensive exception handling with a light weight sanity check, but do we really want to default the numeric types to integer?
