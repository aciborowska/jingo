Currently, the source structure only supports java (ie src/org/apache/etc). The JRuby script support will necessitate a JRuby file as source, and there is currently no home for it. There are a couple options:

1) the cleanest is moving to src/main/java, src/main/ruby, etc. The issue with this is it would require rebasing all patches. That's pretty big...but as Pig grows, may be necessary (this might be a good chance to fix the formatting and spacing of old files!)
2) add a src-jruby/ directory
3) add a src/jruby/ directory
