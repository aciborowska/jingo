When I ran the following Pig script on the command line "pig -c mycluster myscript.pig", I got the error: 

2008-03-07 16:31:45,992 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt -


A = load '/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/fileexists';
B = foreach A generate $2, $1, $0;
C = strean B through `awk '{print $3 " " $4 "\t" $2 "\t" $1}'`;
store C into '/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/results1';



The error message is not quite meaningful, and it took me a while to find out what was wrong - the word "strean" should have been "stream".
