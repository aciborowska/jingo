{ObjectSerializer}
 is pretty useful and could be used by UDF and other user code.

Currently its limitation is that the class that is being deserialized should be visible to root class loader (ie. should be part of CLASSPATH on the front end). The registered jars are not visibile. This is because java.io.ObjectInputStream used to deserialize is from the root classloader.

ObjectSerializer should support another method deserialize(str, ClassLoader).
