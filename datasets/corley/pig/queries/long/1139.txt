Currently the user's ZebraSortInfo by Map/Reduce's writer, namely, the BasicTableOutputFormat.setStorageInfo, is sanity checked by the SortInfo.parse(), although the sanity check could be all performed in that method taking a ZebraSortInfo object.

But the sanity check at the reader side is totally by the caller of TableInputFormat.requireSortedTable method, which should be better encapsulated into a new SortInfo's method.
