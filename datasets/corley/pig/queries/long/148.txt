We may want to skip some of the building steps currently involved in running the Pig unit test with "ant test" to shorten the total time when possible.  Presently, the build script spends long time on the init, compile-sources, and buildJar steps even when the test class and the jar files have already been built successfully before.  Could we add a check in build.xml to skip those steps if the class and/or jar files already exist?  If the use wants to re-build those files when running the unit test, they can first invoke "ant clean" which should be implemented in such a way that it cleanly removes those files.
