The purpose is that I'd like to take advantage of both pig and hive. Pig-latin has powerful data flow expression ability which is useful for ETL while hive is good at query. 

The scenario is that I'd like to store pig alias as spark temporary table (cache can be optional). And I have an another spark engine which share the same SparkContext (in the same JVM) to query the table.

Please close this ticket if it is already supported. I didn't go through all the features of pig-spark.
