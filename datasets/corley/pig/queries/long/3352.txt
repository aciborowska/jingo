If a bz2 block boundary occurs in the middle of a record that is terminated by a carriage-return then the next record will be duplicated.  The compressed stream position is updated at the same time a carriage-return character is seen without a subsequent line-feed character.  Based on the method of reporting position within the compression stream, it incorrectly believes it has read only the carriage-return character into the next compression block and ends up processing the next record which will also be processed by the consumer of the next split.
