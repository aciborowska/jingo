Column pruner for union could fail if one source of union have the schema and the other does not have schema. For example, the following script fail:


a = load '1.txt' as (a0, a1, a2);
b = foreach a generate a0;
c = load '2.txt';
d = foreach c generate $0;
e = union b, d;
dump e;



However, this issue is in trunk only and is not applicable to 0.6 branch.
