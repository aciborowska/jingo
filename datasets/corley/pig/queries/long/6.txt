It needs to be able to load full table in hbase.  (maybe ... difficult? i'm not sure yet.)
Also, as described below, 
It needs to compose an abstract 2d-table only with certain data filtered from hbase array structure using arbitrary query-delimited. 


A = LOAD table('hbase_table');
or
B = LOAD table('hbase_table') Using HbaseQuery('Query-delimited by attributes & timestamp') as (f1, f2[, f3]);



Once test is done on my local machines, 
I will clarify the grammars and give you more examples to help you explain more storage options. 

Any advice welcome.
