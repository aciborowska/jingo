Currently Pig e2e tests take a lot of time to execute and complete the run. But most of the tests are in a single test file i.e. nightly.conf

The idea is to break the nightly.conf file into two, such that each file contains about equal number of tests. This way we can execute the tests on separate clusters and finish the run faster.
