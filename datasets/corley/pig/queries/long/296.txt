udf for computive cumulative sum, row, rank, dense rank.  

To use 
A = load 'data' using PigStorage as ( query, freq );
B = group A all;
C = foreach B {
    Ordered = order A by freq using numeric.OrderDescending;
    generate
        statistics.CUMULATIVE_COLUMN(Ordered, 1) as   â€“ Pig starts with 0th column, this refers to the column freq by offset
                ( query, freq, freq_cumulative_sum, freq_row, freq_rank, freq_dense_rank );
};
D = foreach C generate FLATTEN(A);
