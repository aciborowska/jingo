In the log output of the internalCopyAllGeneratedToDistributedCache() method in pig/data/SchemaTupleFrontend.java the word "cache" is misspelled as "cacche". According to another issue, this was already addressed and resolved in 2013, however the issue persists in the latest releases.

Here is a link to the previous issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-3432
I also issued a pull request to the Github mirror: https://github.com/apache/pig/pull/30
