We need to test how well our symmetric hash join scales.  We need to add a couple of tests.  One will test a join of data with a key that has many instances of the same value.  This can be accomplished by self join the page_view data on user.  For another we should join a large number of tables (say 10) together to see that we can handle many way joins.  We should also consider adding one where the join has many keys (say 10 or 15) to test joins with large keys.
