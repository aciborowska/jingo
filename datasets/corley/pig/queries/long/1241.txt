Exception is thrown for a script like the following:

register /homes/yinghe/owl/string.jar;
a = load 'a.txt' as (id, url);
b = group  a by (id, url);
c = foreach b generate  COUNT(a), (CHARARRAY) string.URLPARSE(group.url)#'url';
dump c;

In this query, URLPARSE() is not accumulative, and it returns a map. 

The accumulator optimizer failed to check UDF in this case, and tries to run the job in accumulative mode. ClassCastException is thrown when trying to cast UDF into Accumulator interface.
