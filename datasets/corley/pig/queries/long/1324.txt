Currently, column pruning does not prune sub-fields inside a complex data-type. For example:

A = load '1.txt' as (a0, a1, a2);
B = group A by a0;
C = foreach B generate group, SUM(A.a1);

Currently, since we group A as a bag, and some part of the bag is used in the following statement, so none of the fields inside A can be pruned. We shall keep track of sub-fields and figure out a2 is not actually needed.
