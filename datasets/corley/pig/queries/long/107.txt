I don't know if that's on purpose but in TestLogicalPlanBuilder.java, those methods don't have the @Test annotation and therefore are not run with latest junit (in my case in eclipse):

public void testQuery41() {}
public void testQuery42() {}
public void testQuery43() {}
public void testQuery44() {}    
public void testQueryFail44() throws Throwable {}
