Hi all,
 We have a host of Join optimizations that have been implemented recently in Pig to improve performance. These include:

http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/docs/r0.5.0/piglatin_reference.html#JOIN

1) Merge Join
2) Skewed Join

It would be nice to mention the Merge Join and Skewed join in the following section on the PigCookBook

http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/docs/r0.5.0/cookbook.html#Take+Advantage+of+Join+Optimization

Can we update this release 0.6??

Thanks
Viraj
