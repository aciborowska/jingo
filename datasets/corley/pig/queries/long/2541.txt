There are a lot of interests in knowing where the data comes from when loading from a directory (or a set of directories). One can do it manually (see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PIG/FAQ). But it will be more convenient for users if we implement this in the PigStorage with a command line option (e.g., pig.source.tagging=true/false) to turn it on/off. By default it will be off.
