I've created a loadfunc that implements LoadMetadata and returns a schema as follows:


(key: bytearray,columns: {((name: chararray,owner_id: chararray))})



(the code is at CASSANDRA-3371 if you want to take a look)

However, whenever I try to access tuple fields within the bag, they cannot be found:


rows = LOAD 'cassandra://Keyspace1/Standard1' USING CassandraStorage();
one = filter rows by columns.owner_id eq 'foo';
dump one;


Produces:

2012-01-20 20:12:14,858 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1200: Pig script failed to parse:
<file foo.pig, line 2, column 7> pig script failed to validate: org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.FrontendException: ERROR 1128: Cannot find field owner_id in :tuple(name:chararray,owner_id:chararray)



Replacing the bag with another tuple works and all the fields are accessible.  I've tried this against the 0.9 and 0.10 branch heads with no luck.  Trunk produces a slight different error:

org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.FrontendException: ERROR 1000: Error during parsing. Pig script failed to parse:
