Pig code when executed on Tez fails with and error 'Schema cannot be determined'. Pig version we use is 0.15. We use Hcat loader to load data into a hive table. But one other code which has the same Hcat loader gets executed successfully. We use the same jar files for both the code.
Any help and suggestions would be of great help.
