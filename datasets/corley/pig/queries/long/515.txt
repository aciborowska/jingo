I write software on top of Pig, which automatically generates Pig scripts. It makes my life much easier if I can write "B = A;" as a pig command. It used to work in the old version of pig, but doesn't work in "types" branch. Should be simple to fix â€“ e.g. rewrite into foreach B generate *; or introduce an "identity" operator, or simply compile it away.

Thanks!
