 In PIG-5323, the code streams the last input similar to MR. In MR only last input can be streamed because it is read last (key values are sorted by index). But in Tez since each input (except for cases of self-join) is separate, it is possible to either stream the first or the last input. For the cases of skewed join, bloom join and replicate join it is the left most dataset that is always big. So we should stream that instead of the right most dataset. 

If we actually had sizes of each input (from counters), we can choose which input to stream dynamically during runtime. This can help with cases of regular join where people have not placed the bigger dataset as the right most one.
