patch adds a -j/forcelocaljars flag which if enabled allows you to do 
pig -j -useHCatalog hdfs://myserver:8020/load/scripts/mydir/myscript.pig

thus loading the pig script REMOTELY 
while loading the jar files LOCALLY

One does this to avoid a single point of failure but avoid one central interversion dependent repository for all the jars across all teams/projects.
