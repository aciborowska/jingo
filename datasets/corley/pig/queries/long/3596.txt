If file is loaded by PigStorage without schema every variable is bytearray. It can be casted to other types. After processing with UDF the result cannot be casted anymore.

Meaningful example:

in:

1
1	2
1	2	3


script:

a = load 'in';
b = foreach a generate flatten(TOBAG($0..)) as x;
c = foreach b generate (int)x * (int)x;
dump c;


ERROR 1052: Cannot cast bytearray to int
