The proposal is to


	for compilation always use dependencies from Ivy
	for packaging to have 2 targets:



(1) The current jar target will not package it and rely on having it available at runtime
(2) Add a new target jar_with_hadoop that does what the current jar does
(3) Add a property that allows to build the release tar with and without hadoop.jar embeded into pig.
