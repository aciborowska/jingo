    For very big Tez jobs (~50K tasks), AM quickly goes OOM without -XX:+UseNUMA. tez.am.launch.cmd-opts default setting has that, but since pig gives preference to yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts if present (which usually it is),  -XX:+UseNUMA is not there. Need to add -XX:+UseNUMA if we are picking up mapreduce setting.
