This is something I thought would be cool for a while, so I sat down and did it because I think there are some useful debugging tools it'd help with.

The idea is that if you attach an annotation to a UDF, the Tuple or DataBag you output will be flattened. This is quite powerful. A very common pattern is:

a = foreach data generate Flatten(MyUdf(thing)) as (a,b,c);

This would let you just do:

a = foreach data generate MyUdf(thing);

With the exact same result!
