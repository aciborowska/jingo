Jira to hold the integration of an eclipse plugin for pig.

I will provide a zip of all the source files and directory structure. You just need to put them in the contrib folder and svn add them. (we can take care of the svn:ignore later)

I changed all sausage references with guinea.
I also replaced my name with "Apache Pig" in the various xml files.

I propose this svn structure, having guinea in it's own directory will allow the plugin to have it's own release cycle independent from pig.

/pig/ (http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/pig/)

There are actually 3 projects:

	"org.apache.pig.eclipse" (the plugin)
	"org.apache.pig.eclipse.feature" the feature just making a reference to the plugin but necessary for the update-site
	"update-site" the update site for eclipse users so that people can add the url http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/pig/update-site to their eclispe (there is no need to put this one in trunk/branches/tags since it basically just a website with a jar)



The work flow when releasing a new plug in version is:

	import all 3 project in eclipse
	"org.apache.pig.eclipse.feature" > Export > Plug-in Development > Deployable feature > Directory: /local/dir/to/update-site > Finish
	svn commit /local/dir/to/update-site
