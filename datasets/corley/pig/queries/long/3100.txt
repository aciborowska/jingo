In the case that a .pig_schema file is present, if you have a record with fewer than expected fields, pig errors out with an index out of bounds exception that is annoying, unnecessary, and unhelpful.

Instead of improving logging, I decided to just do what pig should do, which is fill in the records.

Patch will include a test and the fix.
