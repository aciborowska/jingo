When I ran the following Pig script on the command line (pig -c cluster -latest p_11), Pig returns immediately without doing any processing.  When I entered the script line by line into GRUNT, after I entered the second line, I had to type one extra ";" in addition to the original one in order for Pig to accept the line.  In the end, Pig gave me the correct results.

Here is the script, p_11:


A = load '/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k';
B = stream A through `python ./python/MySimpleStreamApp.py --upper` as (name, age, gpa);
store B into 'results_11';



Here is the python streaming script, MySimpleStreamApp.py:


#!/usr/bin/python

import sys
import optparse

def main():
    p = optparse.OptionParser()
    p.add_option('--upper', '-u', action="store_true")
    options, arguments = p.parse_args()

    line = sys.stdin.readline()
    while line:
        if options.upper == True:
            line = line.upper()
        sys.stdout.write(line)
        line = sys.stdin.readline()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
