A perlÂ related issue found while testing streaming. In newer perl versions (>5.26), current directory (".") is not included in @INC, so PerlStreamingDepend may fail during "use PigStreamingModule;". A possible solution is to let this module add current directory for itself to make it more independent from the environment (current perl version).

Test case was:



define CMD `perl PigStreamingDepend.pl - sio_5_1 sio_5_2` input(stdin) output('sio_5_1', 'sio_5_2') ship('./libexec/PigStreamingDepend.pl', './libexec/PigStreamingModule.pm');
A = load '/user/hrt_qa/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k';
B = stream A through CMD;
store B into '/user/hrt_qa/out/hrtqa-1539851229-streaming.conf-StreamingIO/StreamingIO_5.out';
