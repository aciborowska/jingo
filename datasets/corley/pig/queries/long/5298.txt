Although we pull in jetty libraries in ivy Pig does not depend on org.mortbay.jetty explicitly. The only exception I see is in Piggybank where I think this can be swapped by javax.el-api and log4j.

We should investigate (check build, run unit tests across all exec modes) and remove if it turns out to be unnecessary.
