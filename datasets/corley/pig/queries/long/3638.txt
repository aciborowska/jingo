Hi. I have a suggestion to improve PigUnit
1. Add default functionality to feed several input to one script. I didn't find a way how to do it using exsiting API and had to extend it.
2. Allow to use "native" loaders. There are plenty of bug when you start to run in prod your script with AvroStorage/any other complacated storage. You can catch many schema/types related bugs on unit-test level.
3. The same for storage.
