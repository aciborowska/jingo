There are a big  performance difference in join between spark and mr mode.

daily = load './NYSE_daily' as (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray,
            date:chararray, open:float, high:float, low:float,
            close:float, volume:int, adj_close:float);
divs  = load './NYSE_dividends' as (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray,
            date:chararray, dividends:float);
jnd   = join daily by (exchange, symbol), divs by (exchange, symbol);
store jnd into './join.out';



join.sh

mode=$1
start=$(date +%s)
./pig -x $mode  $PIG_HOME/bin/join.pig
end=$(date +%s)
execution_time=$(( $end - $start ))
echo "execution_time:"$excution_time
