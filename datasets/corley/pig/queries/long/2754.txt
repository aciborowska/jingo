sample code like that:

txns = LOAD '/test' USING PigStorage() AS (domain:chararray,amount:double);

txns_by_domain = GROUP txns BY domain;

test_txns = FOREACH txns_by_domain 
{ domain = group;  test_out = SUM(txns.amount * txns.amount);}
...

it looks built-in function SUM did not support inner multiply and sum up.
