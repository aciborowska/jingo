Running commands on

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PIG/How+to+set+up+Eclipse+environment

$ ant clean eclipse-files

succeeds, but Eclipse shows 1565 errors. I uploaded eclipse20.log with the errors.

Noting "tez" related errors, I ran:

$ ant setTezEnv eclipse-files

succeeds, but Eclipse shows 505 errors. I uploaded eclipse23.log with the errors.

Incidentally, running both:

$ ant clean setTezEnv eclipse-files
$ ant clean eclipse-files compile gen

fails with following error:
