This JIRA is a proposal to create a Hadoop table management service: Owl. Today, MapReduce and Pig applications interacts directly with HDFS directories and files and must deal with low level data management issues such as storage format, serialization/compression schemes, data layout, and efficient data accesses, etc, often with different solutions. Owl aims to provide a standard way to addresses this issue and abstracts away the complexities of reading/writing huge amount of data from/to HDFS.

Owl has a data access API that is modeled after the traditional Hadoop !InputFormt and a management API to manipulate Owl objects.  This JIRA is related to Pig-823 (Hadoop Metadata Service) as Owl has an internal metadata store.  Owl integrates with different storage module like Zebra with a pluggable architecture.

 Initially, the proposal is to submit Owl as a Pig contrib project.  Over time, it makes sense to move it to a Hadoop subproject.
