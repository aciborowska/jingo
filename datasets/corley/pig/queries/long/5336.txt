When working on PIG-5334, saw bunch of old documents still being uploaded on svn&site.

knoguchi@truelisten-lm site> ls publish/docs/ | sort -V
r0.7.0/
r0.8.1/
r0.9.1/
r0.9.2/
r0.10.0/
r0.10.1/
r0.11.0/

r0.13.0/

r0.17.0/



Sometimes I see our users referencing old documents due to this.
We should retire most of them and leave the recent ones.
