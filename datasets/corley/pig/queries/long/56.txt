Now that DataBag has an iterator method, it can implement Iterable with no other changes.  This would allow bags to be used in a foreach loop like 
for(Tuple t : bag) {
  // do something with t
}

The attached patch has DataBag implement iterable and converts all bag iterator usages in pig to use foreach loops.
