Patch from PIG-4819 that changed RANDOM() broke TestBuiltin.testURIWithCurlyBrace which I fixed in PIG-4833 which broke TestBuiltin.testUniqueID in hadoop1.x mode...

Hopefully I can fix this without breaking another test...

TestBuiltin.testUniqueID has been failing on hadoop-1.x since the test was fixed in PIG-4819.
(It used to ignore the results and always return success.)
