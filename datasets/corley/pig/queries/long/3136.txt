This is something Daniel and I have talked about before, and now that we have the @ syntax, this is easy to implement. The idea is that relation names are no longer required, and you can instead use a fat arrow (obviously that can be changed) to signify this. The benefit is not having to engage in the mental load of having to name everything.

One other possibility is just making "alias =" optional. I fear that that could be a little TOO magical, but I welcome opinions.
