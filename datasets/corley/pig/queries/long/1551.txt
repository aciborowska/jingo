PIG-1354 introduced a set of UDFs that can be used to dynamically wrap simple Java methods in a UDF, so that users don't need to create trivial wrappers if they are ok sacrificing some speed.

This issue is to extend the set of methods that can be wrapped this way to include methods that do not take any arguments, and methods that take arrays of 
{int,long,float,double,string}
 as arguments. 
Arrays are expected to be represented by bags in Pig. Notably, this allows users to wrap statistical functions in o.a.commons.math.stat.StatUtils .
