Currently, the parser/type checker uses the getReturnType to deduce the return type of the user defined function (UDF). This mechanism is satisfactory only for basic types (int, long, ...); for composite types (tuple, bag), the schema is also required.The abstract class EvalFunc interface exposes the outputSchema to deduce the return type/schema of the UDF. The parser/type checker should use this method to figure out the return type/schema of the UDF and use it appropriately.
