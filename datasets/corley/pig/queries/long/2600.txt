It would be nice if Pig played better with Maps. To that end, I'd like to add a lot of utility around Maps.


	TOBAG should take a Map and output 
{(key, value)}
	TOMAP should take a Bag in that same form and make a map.
	KEYSET should return the set of keys.
	VALUESET should return the set of values.
	VALUELIST should return the List of values (no deduping).
	INVERSEMAP would return a Map of values => the set of keys that refer to that Key



This would all be pretty easy. A more substantial piece of work would be to make Pig support non-String keys (this is especially an issue since UDFs and whatnot probably assume that they are all Integers). Not sure if it is worth it.

I'd love to hear other things that would be useful for people!
