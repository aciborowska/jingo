In the PhysicalPlan clone method, the algorithm used is as follows:

1. Create an empty plan

2. For all the operators in the plan, 
   a. clone the operator 
   b. add it to the plan

3. For all the keys (from_node) in the map mFromEdges
   a. For all the values (to_node) for this key
      i. Connect the from_node to the to_node in the plan

There are no guarantees on the order in which the from_nodes in the mFromEdges are processed, we could get out of order connections in the graph.

Example:

If we have UDF with two arguments like myUDF(a, b) in a plan, the order in which the nodes are processed will determine the cloned plan. We could end up with 

myUDF(a, b)

OR 

myUDF(b,. a)

depending on the order in which a and b appear in the mFromEdges look up table.
