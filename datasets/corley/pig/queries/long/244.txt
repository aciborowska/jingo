A while ago we have added escaping support for string literals in Pig query. This added a requirement that every "/" will have to be escaped. Currently  there is an ongoing issue about adding escaping support for Load/Store parameters. 

These are just like we do patching work just on the spot without looking at Pig as the whole. I think we should have a consensus on "what" and "where" to allow (or enforce) escaping.
