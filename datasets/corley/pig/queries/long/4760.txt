PIG-4529 reveal a MR counter limit issue imposed to Pig. The original fix won't work in Oozie since Oozie launcher already imposed counter limit and Pig cannot change it (there is an internal flag in Limits to make sure it does not init twice).

Actually the MR counter is completely redundant and should be removed.
