We are currently depending (only for tests though) on uber jar avro-tools that have 12 MB. It seems that the original intention was to use avro-tools artifact without all dependencies, however the classifier was incorrectly specified in the ivy.xml. Considering that we have most of the avro-tools dependencies on classpath already, I think that it would be cleaner to follow the intention.
