From the pig 0.10.0 and 0.11.0 documentation:

http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.10.0/udf.html
Pig UDFs can currently be implemented in three languages: Java, Python, JavaScript and Ruby.

http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.11.0/udf.html
Pig UDFs can currently be implemented in three languages: Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby and Groovy.


I believe this should be the following, respectively:
Pig UDFs can currently be implemented in three languages: Java, Python and Ruby... also JavaScript
Pig UDFs can currently be implemented in three languages: Java, Python and Ruby... also JavaScript and Groovy.


Or perhaps those should be "four" and "five" but that's a matter of perspective.
