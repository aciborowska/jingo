I wanted to do a self-join


1       one
1       uno
2       two
2       dos
3       three
3       tres



viraj@machine~/pigscripts >pig -x local script.pig
script.pig
– since the below does not work

A = load 'Adataset.txt' as (key:int, value:chararray);
C = join A by key, A by key;
dump C;

 

– i tried the below it fails with:

A = load 'Adataset.txt' as (key:int, value:chararray);
B = A;
C = join A by key, B by key;
dump C;

There is a workaround currently:

A = load 'Adataset.txt' as (key:int, value:chararray);
B = foreach A generate *;
C = join A by key, B by key;
dump C;
