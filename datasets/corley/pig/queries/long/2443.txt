UDF that could be used to check if a String is numeric (or an Integer). Several tools such as Splunk, AbInitio have this UDF built-in and companies making an effort to move to Hadoop/Pig could use this.

Use Case:
In raw logs there are certain filters/conditions applied based on whether a particular field/value is numeric or not. For eg, SPLIT A INTO CATEGORY1 IF IsInt($0), CATEGORY2 IF !IsInt($0);
