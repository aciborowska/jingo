Hi
In a recent github mirror, I've found suspicious code.
Branch: trunk
Path: src/org/apache/pig/pen/util/ExampleTuple.java


...
 39     Tuple t = null;
...
110     @Override
111     public void reference(Tuple t) {
112         t.reference(t);
113     }



In Line 112, `t.reference' should be `this.t.reference'? This might be just a trivial thing as the class name as ExampleTuple. But I wanted to report just in case.

Thanks!
