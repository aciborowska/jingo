Pig Latin allows user to specify a HDFS directory to store the streaming stderr ourput (if necessary). For instance, the following script


DEFINE Y `stream.pl` stderr('stream_err' limit 100);
X = STREAM A THROUGH Y;
STORE X INTO '/tmp/stream_out';

 

will put streaming stderr into the directory /tmp/stream_out/_logs/stream_err.  Namely, in the _logs directory of the job's output directory.

But the problem occurs with multiquery scripts where a single job can have multiple output directories. The current implementation stores streamig stderr in the _logs directory of a ramdom generated tmp directory and it would be hard for user to find if she needs to look ino streaming stderr messages.

A better solution is needed to store the streaming stderr in HDFS for multiquery scripts.
