Currently though Pig has a type checker it is not called with every query registration. Instead, the system waits till there is a dump or store. I think its not in line with the philosophy of catching errors early. Instead of the typechecking happening in the execute method, it should happen in registerQuery and the execute method should expect a type checked plan.
