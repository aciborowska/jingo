Documentation syntax should reflect the correct code indicated in the tutorial script.

Documentation syntax 

ordered_uniq_frequency = ORDER filtered_uniq_frequency BY (hour, score);



Above syntax results in this error:

2010-06-30 22:12:16,412 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1000: Error during parsing. Encountered " "," ", "" at line 1, column 64.
Was expecting:
    ")" ..



(Correct) Tutorial script syntax

ordered_uniq_frequency = ORDER filtered_uniq_frequency BY hour, score;
