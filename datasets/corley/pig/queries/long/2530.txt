The below script results in incorrect output for Pig 0.10 but runs fine with Pig 0.8,


input.txt
1	4
1	3
2	3
2	4




a = load 'input.txt' as (v1:int, v2:int);
b = group a by v1;
c = foreach b { x = a; x = order x by v2 asc; generate flatten(x); }
store c into 'c1';




Output from Pig 0.10
--------------------
1       4
1       3
2       3
2       4

Looking at the explain, it seems like the sorting is entirely missed out. 
The script produces correct results if I change the alias name ie;

c = foreach b 
{ x = a; x1 = order x by v2 asc; generate flatten(x1); }
