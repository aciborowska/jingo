One of the nice thing between Pig and Hbase is that they can be integrated. Thanks to recent patch (PIG-1250) committed.

The documentation is not well updated yet (currently almost relate to the patch itself). It world be nice to document this feature in detail in the Pig documentation page (e.g, in here: http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.9.1/func.html#load-store-functions).
