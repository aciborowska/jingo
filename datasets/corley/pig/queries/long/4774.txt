For UDF backward compatibility issue after POStatus.STATUS_NULL refactory issue, PIG-4184 fixed the udfs to handle null by adding input.get(0) == null check in all the UDFs. UDFs extending AlgebraicMathBase, AVG, MIN, MAX, etc was not fixed.

Script to reproduce NPE. It is an odd usage doing aggregation after join instead of group by which one user was doing and rewrite moving aggregation after group by fixed the NPE. Might be rare, but there might be other cases where user call those functions with a bag directly without group by which might cause nulls to be passed to it.

A = LOAD '/tmp/data' as (f1:int, f2:int, f3:int);
B = LOAD '/tmp/data1' as (f1:int, f2:int, f3:int);
A1 = GROUP A by f1;
A2 = FOREACH A1 GENERATE group as f1, $1;
C = JOIN B by f1 LEFT, A2 by f1;
D = FOREACH C GENERATE B::f1, (double)SUM(A2::A.f3)/SUM(A2::A.f2);
STORE D into '/tmp/out';
