HIVE-5547 added support or 'usehcatalog' parameter in WebHCat job submission.  When Pig script is submitted that uses HCat, WebHCat will ship Hive tar (if so configured) to the target node in the cluster.  This works with Pig 12, but with Pig 11 pig script fails looking for jdo2 library (among others which are not present in Hive 13 tar file).

TestPig_11 in hive/hcatalog/src/test/e2e/templeton/tests/jobsubmission.conf has the test case.
