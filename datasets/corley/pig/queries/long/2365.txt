Given that TOP is basically always used with FLATTEN, now that FLATTEN prepends the bag name, the output is suboptimal.

a = load 'thing' as (x:int, y:int, z:int);
b = group a all;
c = foreach b generate flatten(TOP(10,1,a));
describe c;
--currently: c: 
{null::x: int,null::y: int,null::z: int}
--without a one line change could be: c: 
{a::x: int,a::y: int,a::z: int}

The current implementation actually throws away this info, so it's just a matter of not doing that. Patch attached.
