In jenkins, it  shows that TestLogicalPlanBuilder#testQuery90 fails. After debugging, it always fails in 
Line1139 

 Assert.assertTrue(foreach.getSchema().toString( false ).equals("mygroup:tuple(myname:chararray,myage:int),mycount:long"));



The script is 

a = load 'myfile' as (name:Chararray, age:Int, gpa:Float);b = group a by (name, age);c = foreach b generate group as mygroup:(myname, myage), COUNT(a) as mycount;store c into 'output';



The reason why fails is because the schema of mygroup(myname,myage) is 
mygroup(myname:bytearray,myage:bytearray) and this user-defined schema is assigned to c. so the schema of c is
not mygroup:tuple(myname:chararray,myage:int) but mygroup:tuple(myname:bytearray,myage:bytearray).

This problem is imported since PIG-2315 as ForEachUserSchemaVisitor is used in LogicalPlan.
