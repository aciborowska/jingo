This bug will happen if the following condition meet:
1. LoadFunc is susceptible to duplicated fields in fieldsToRead. The only LoadFunc we notice now is Zebra.
2. The first item in FOREACH statement contains reference to the same input more than once.

For example, the following script will be affected:
a = load '11' using org.apache.hadoop.zebra.pig.TableLoader('a0');
b = foreach a generate a0+a0;
