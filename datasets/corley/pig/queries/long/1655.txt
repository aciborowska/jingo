As part of PIG-1405, some udfs from piggybank were made standard udfs. But now the code is duplicated in piggybank and org.apache.pig.builtin. . This can cause confusion.
I am planning to make these udfs in piggybank subclasses of those in org.apache.pig.builtin. so that users don't have to change their scripts.
