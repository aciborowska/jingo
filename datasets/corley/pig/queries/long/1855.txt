Currently Pig compiles against a pre-packaged, source controlled set of versions of Hadoop:
lib/hadoop18.jar and lib/hadoop20.jar.

While this is convenient for Pig development as a standalone activity it makes it a pain to be able to use:
1) The hadoop??.jar contains classes that do not belong to the o.a.h namespace. In other words it contains com.sun.*, org.apache.jasper and all sorts of other auxiliary classes used by hadoop.
2) When building Pig against your own version of Hadoop one has to untar the hadoop20.jar, splice in the o.a.h classes, re-pack (and commit to source control?)

One would expect the ability to be able to point Pig build to output from own Hadoop build.
