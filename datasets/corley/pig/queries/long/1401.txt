"explain -script <script file>" executes grunt commands like run/dump/copy etc - explain -script should not execute any grunt command and only explain the query plans.

Note: "explain <alias>" statement in the script will still cause all grunt commands upto the explain to be executed. This issue only fixes the behavior of "explain -script <script file>" wherein any grunt commands like "run", "dump", "copy", "fs .." present in the supplied <script file> will need to be ignored.

This should be documented in the release in which this jira will be resolved.
