often i want to get files into the classpath (that are not necessarily .class files), and shipped to the mappers.
i can manually do this by jar'ing the file or dir and registering said jar, but it would be much simpler and more effective for pig to support this directly (as it unpacks said jar internally anyway).
it should have entirely the same semantic that register already has, but it should accept files/dirs that are not jar files.
