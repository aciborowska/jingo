A pig task gets busy and finally timeout(for more than 600 secs) when spilling large bags to disk. It seems during this period, progress will not be reported. 

In other word, if one record contains large bags, it may require multiple spills. There is no progress report between these spills until whole record is written to disk. Is this a bug leading to timeout?
