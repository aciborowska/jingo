Pig currently ignores parameters from configuration files added statically to Configuration objects as Configuration.addDefaultResource(filename.xml).

Consider the following scenario -
In a hadoop FileSystem driver for a non-HDFS filesystem you load properties specific to that FileSystem in a static initializer block in the class that extends org.apache.hadoop.fs.Filesystem for your FileSystem like below - 


class MyFileSystem extends FileSystem {

        static {
		Configuration.addDefaultResource("myfs-default.xml");
		Configuration.addDefaultResource("myfs-site.xml");
	}


}



Interfaces like the Hadoop CLI, Hive, Hadoop M/R can find configuration parameters defined in these configuration files as long as they are on the classpath.

However, Pig cannot find parameters from these files, because it ignores configuration files added statically.

Pig should allow users to specify if they would like pig to read parameters from resources loaded statically.
