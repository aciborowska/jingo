A new test case (testNestedPlan) added to TestEvalPipeline has the following query:

        pig.registerQuery("A = LOAD 'file:" + tmpFile + "';");
        pig.registerQuery("B = group A by $0;");
        + "C1 = filter A by $0 > -1;"
        + "C2 = distinct C1;"
        + "C3 = distinct A;"
        + "generate (int)group;"
        + "};";

Expected:

(0)
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)

Got:

(NULL)
