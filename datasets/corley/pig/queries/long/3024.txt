When the hadoop core version dependency is changed, TestEmptyInputDir almost always fails as coded.  The issue is that it assumes all hadoop versions  have MAPREDUCE-3606 fixed except two.  It is more resilient to check families of releases for the fix than to check the release number directly.  Right now, it is safer to assume the bug is present unless the release is one of those with the fix than it is to assume all releases have the fix except for two.
