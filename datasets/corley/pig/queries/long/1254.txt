Currently junit is configured to run only with 256M of memory. This is too low considering the fact that most tests create MiniCluster, run Hadoop local job runner, run tests etc. all within same jvm.  This results in transient failures, longer time for tests to complete etc. This should be upped atleast to 512M.

build.xml:

    <junit showoutput="${test.output}" printsummary="yes" haltonfailure="no" fork="yes" maxmemory="256m" dir="${basedir}" timeout="${test.timeout}" errorProperty="tests.failed" failureProperty="tests.failed">
