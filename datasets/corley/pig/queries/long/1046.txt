This fails -
j = join l1 by $0, l2 by $0 using 'skewed';
This works -
j = join l1 by $0, l2 by $0 using "skewed";

String constants are single-quoted in pig-latin. If the algorithm specification is supposed to be a string, specifying it within single quotes should be supported.
Alternatively, we should be using identifiers here, since these are pre-defined in pig users will not be specifying arbitrary values that might not be valid identifier.
