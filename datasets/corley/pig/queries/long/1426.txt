Most of  time,  the size of tuple is not very large, one byte is enough for store the size of tuple. So I suggest to use VInt instead of Int for the size of tuple when doing Serialization. Because the key type of map output is Tuple, so this can reduce the amount of data transferred from mapper to reducer.
