let's say there are 2 scripts a and b, I imported b in a, and both a and b use the same parameter like time stamp. but after executed script a, I find out that the parameter in b is not substituted at all, and any description clauses are add in b will cause an error when parsing, which is not convenient. 
Now, I have to manually merge the 2 scripts into 1 to bypass the problem.
I suppose the order of import and parameter substitution is wrong, which cause the problem.
