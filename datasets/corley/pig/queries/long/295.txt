The problem is that last is supposed to be holding the last read value from the tuple but clearly it does not right now as can be seen below:
              int last = -1;
		while (iter.hasNext()){
			Tuple t = iter.next();
			if (eliminateDuplicates)
{
				assertTrue(last < t.getAtomField(0).numval().intValue());
			}
else
{
				assertTrue(last <= t.getAtomField(0).numval().intValue());
				assertEquals(t.arity(), 2);
			}
		}

last is always -1 & all tests pass. This should be correct aptly for the non-types branch if we want to. But the fix I am attaching is just for the types branch. Here since we do not have types, there will be bytearray comparison leading to lexicographic sorting. So changed the tests to test that rather than numeric sorting.
