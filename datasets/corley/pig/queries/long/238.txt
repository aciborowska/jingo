Running Pig Programs

There are two ways to run pig. The first way is by using pig.pl that can be found in the scripts directory of your source tree. Using the script would require having Perl installed on your machine. You can use it by issuing the following command: pig.pl -cp

pig.pl is missing from pig/truck/scripts:
