Setting output compression using "SET" in the script does not work:
SET mapred.output.compress true;
SET mapred.output.compression.codec org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.GzipCodec;

We did some trick to make individual compression setting for multistore work. Instead of the above parameter, using the following works:
SET output.compression.enabled true;
SET output.compression.codec org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.GzipCodec;

However, this is against intuition. We should use mapred.output.compress/mapred.output.compression.codec.
