Since in grunt parsing happens statement by statement and in file, whole of the script is considered, its possible to have different error messages. Problem here is that in file mode, most important error message is gobbled up and is not printed either on stdout/stderr or in logfile. In 0.8 it was correctly getting printed at stderr.
