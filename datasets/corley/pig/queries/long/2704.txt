While developing a new Tuple, I realized that there are a lot of assumptions about how Tuples work, but no clear way how to test those assumptions (short of trying to force your new Tuple into as many codepaths as possible). It'd be very useful to have a test suite that takes a Tuple (or perhaps the factory that generates it, for more control), and tests that it operates as a Tuple should.
