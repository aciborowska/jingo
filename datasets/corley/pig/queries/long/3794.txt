When you connect to an HDP 1.3 version HDINSIGHT cluster with remote desktop, if you try this:

c:\apps\dist\pig-0.11.0.1.3.2.0-05>bin\pig -useHCatalog

you get this:

"HCAT_HOME should be defined"

but you should not get an error.

It appears that pig.cmd should use "HCATALOG_HOME" instead of "HCAT_HOME".

The same problem exists on the 1.3 one-box installation for Windows. A quick look at the source code indicates it is still a problem on trunk.

In addition, if you set hive.metastore.uris to '', this is supposed to create an embedded metastore instead of going to the metastore service. This fails on Azure HDINSIGHT and Windows because of missing datanucleus and sqljdbc4 jars. 

Finally, if you submit a pig job from WebHCat, due to argument quoting for windows, -useHCatalog comes in as "-useHCatalog" into pig.cmd. This causes -useHCatalog to never work on Windows from WebHCat.
