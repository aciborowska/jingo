getRemoteHosts is to extract hosts from a URL string. URL can also be a comma separated string. The current logic is:
1. split URL into components with regard to ","
2. for each component, get its host

However, it does not deal with some URL components which contains comma, such as:
scheme://
{a,b,c}
xxx

A better implementation is needed.
