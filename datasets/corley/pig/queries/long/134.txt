In http://incubator.apache.org/pig/deployment.html, this line is outdated:


Requirements
   1. Java 1.6.x. preferably from Sun. Set JAVA_HOME to the root of your Java installation.

It is 1.5.x

I will provide the patch for deployment.xml, but I think you need to regenerate the forrest documentation (html and pdf).
