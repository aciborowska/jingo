Consider the following. I have my own Storer implementing StoreFunc and I am throwing FrontEndException (and other Exceptions derived from PigException) in its various methods. I expect those error messages to be shown in error scenarios. Instead Pig gobbles up my error messages and shows its own generic error message like: 

010-07-31 14:14:25,414 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 2116: Unexpected error. Could not validate the output specification for: default.partitoned
Details at logfile: /Users/ashutosh/workspace/pig/pig_1280610650690.log



Instead I expect it to display my error messages which it stores away in that log file.
