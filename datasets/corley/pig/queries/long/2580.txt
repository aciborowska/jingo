Would be possible for someone to modify JsonStorage.java to also implement FileInputLoadFunc ? e.g. atleast to be able to load .json documents which were stored with PigStorage or use the same json structure?

– store JsonStorage() test
a = load '/jsonStorage1.txt' as (a0:int, a1:
{t:(a10:int, a11:chararray)}
,a2:(a20:double, a21), a3:map[chararray]);
store a into '/jsonStorage1.json' using JsonStorage();

– load JsonStorage() test
b = load '/jsonStorage1.json' using JsonStorage();

descbibe a; – both a and b have same schema but b got its schema from the json meta
describe b;
