HBase implicitly stores timestamp for each cell. Sometimes this feature is used to track historical data. I would like to provide option for HBaseStorage  which would return cell timestamp in milliseconds

Interface:
add option "withTimestamp" to HBaseStorage constructor
Implementation:
add timestamp:long as last element of tuple.

RFC.
