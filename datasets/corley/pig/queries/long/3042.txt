If DISTINCT would operate as a function we could do something like this


SPLIT data INTO
    new_entries IF COUNT(DISTINCT(*)) > 1,
    duplicate_entries OTHERWISE;



Since this is unfortunately not the case (see also PIG-826), I would like to propose a new SPLIT_DISTINCT (name is up for discussion) operator that acts in the way the above code intents. One would then just have to write:


SPLIT_DISTINCT data INTO new_entries, duplicate_entries;



Wanting to separate duplicates from the rest of e.g. log data, is a common scenario I think and the new operator would make this task a lot simpler.
