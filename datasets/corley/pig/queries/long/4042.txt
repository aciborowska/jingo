I am working on a patch for HBaseStorage to implement IndexableLoadFunc. The results that are returned for the RHS of the join are always bytearrays regardless of the schema that is set, the caster, etc.. and the join only works if both relations have the row key set to be a bytearray. I have attached the patch I am working on with the two failing test cases. I am very eager to get this resolved, but after digging through the code I'm not sure where to start to fix it.
