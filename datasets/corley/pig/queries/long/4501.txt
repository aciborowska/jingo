AvroTupleWrapper, AvroMapWrapper and AvroBagWrapper expose write APIs but their implementation is broken. 

For instance, we can do 

Tuple t = TupleFactory.newInstnace().newTuple(1);
t.set(0, 0);
avroTupleWrapper.set(0, t);
avroTupleWrapper.get(0);  


The last line will (in most cases) fail depending upon what the avro schema is for the 0th element.

I'm attaching a patch which highlights this more concretely. The patch only shows failures in AvroTupleWrapper but similar problems exist in corresponding Map and Bag classes
