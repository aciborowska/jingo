I've extended Pig fixed width loader to handle bytes in a fixed or delimited record.  This was a result of us getting files that are binary where some columns are in BigEndian.  We had to read the files in bytes and the column that is designated as BigEndian read correctly.

I would like to contribute this enhanced loader back to the community!
