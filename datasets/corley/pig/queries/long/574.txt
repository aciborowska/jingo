This is a request for a "run file" command in grunt which will read a script from the local file system and execute the script interactively while in the grunt shell.

One of the things that slows down iterative development of large, complicated Pig scripts that must operate on hadoop fs data is that the edit, run, debug cycle is slow because I must wait to allocate a Hadoop-on-Demand (hod) cluster for each iteration.  I would prefer not to preallocate a cluster of nodes (though I could).

Instead, I'd like to have one window open and edit my Pig script using vim or emacs, write it, and then type "run myscript.pig" at the grunt shell until I get things right.

I'm used to doing similar things with Oracle, MySQL, and R.
