After we add a new method "getCastString" into ResourceSchema, TestPigStorageSchema begin to fail. Seems PigStorageSchema try to serialize cast string into the schema. If I change the name of the method from "getCastString" to "genCastString", then the error message go away. Since Dmitriy is the author of TestPigStorageSchema, I need his help to check if this is the right approach to fix it.
