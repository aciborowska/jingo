PySystemState has getJarFileName() api that does searches for the jar that has class PySystemState Class. The answer it expects is â€“
jar:file:/install_dir/jython.jar!/org/python/core/PySystemState.class
Then it pulls out </install_dir/jython.jar> out of above string and in initPath adds python.path and </install_dir/jython.jar>/Lib to sys.path.

With MAPREDUCE-967, job.jar is not unpacked on the task node. The job.jar always has jython code (as pig ships it from scriptjars when register is invoked).  Hence, above code path puts /Lib inside job.jar on sys.path and all works fine.
But, without MAPREDUCE-967, job.jar is unpacked into jobcachedir. So, getJarFileName in above code in jython returns null and it never gets <jython>.jar on classpath as its unpacked.
