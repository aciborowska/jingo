  We had a scenario where a user had multiple udfs all named udfs.py. JythonFunction was referring to the absolute localized path of udfs.py in the Oozie launcher. Tasks which ran on a node and which had a different version of udfs.py localized to same path (hashcode conflict) as the Oozie launcher failed.  We should be referring to relative path of the files. The current code check is the canonical path starts with cwd, but that does not work as the files are downloaded to a different location and symlinked to the current working directory of the task attempt.
