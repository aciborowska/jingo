Versions: Pig 0.12.0
Hadoop: 2.2.0

I have compiled Pig to work with hadoop 2.2.0 and could successfully run simple PIG load/store commands in mapreduce mode. The hadoop cluster is remote.

But I was getting errors similar to the one mentioned in PIG-3930.
I tried the patch mentioned in PIG-3930, and that did remove the error I was getting in local mode.

However, that error has now moved over into mapreduce mode.
