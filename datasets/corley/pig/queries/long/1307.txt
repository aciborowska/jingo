pig uses a size changed flag to indicate when we should recalculate the memory footprint of the bag. the setting of this flag is sprinkled throughout the code. unfortunately, it is missing in DefaultDataBag.spill(). there may be other cases as well. the problem with this case is that when the low memory threshold kicks in, bags are spilled until the desired amount of memory is "freed". since the flag is not being reset subsequent calls to the threshold events will retrigger the spill() and think more memory was freed even though nothing was actually spilled.
