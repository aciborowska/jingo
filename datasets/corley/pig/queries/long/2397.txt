For a class project we developed a whole set of Pig scripts for TPC-H. Our goals are:

1) identifying the bottlenecks of Pig's performance especially of its relational operators,

2) studying how to write efficient scripts by making full use of Pig Latin's features,

3) comparing with Hive's TPC-H results for verifying both 1) and 2).

We will update the JIRA with our scripts, results and analysis soon.
