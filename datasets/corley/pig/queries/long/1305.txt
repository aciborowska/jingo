The Pig Reference Manual needs to be updated:

Relational Operators

Syntax:

LOAD 'data' [USING function] [AS schema];

'data' 

Please note:
Pig reads in both bz2 and gz formats correctly as long as they are not concatenated gzip or bz2 generated in this manner. cat *.bz2  > text/concat.bz2. Your M/R jobs may succeed but the results will not be accurate.
