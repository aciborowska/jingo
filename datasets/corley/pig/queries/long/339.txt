The following script returns double records as expected:
a = load 'a';
b = load 'b';
c = union a, b;
d = cross a, b;
e = limit c 100;
f = limit d 100;
dump e;   // return double number of records
dump f;    // return double number of records

Seems to be the limit operator in reduce plan is not effective.
