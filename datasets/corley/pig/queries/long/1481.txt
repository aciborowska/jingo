Hi

We've been using the Hadoop MiniCluster to do unit testing of our pig scripts in the following way.

MiniCluster minicluster = MiniCluster.buildCluster(2,2);
pigServer = new  PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, minicluster.getProperties());

This has been working fine for 0.6 and 0.7. 

However in the trunk (0.8) looks like there is change due to which an exception is thrown if hadoop-site.xml or core-site.xml is not found in the classpath.

org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecException: ERROR 4010: Cannot find hadoop configurations in classpath (neither hadoop-site.xml nor core-site.xml was found in the classpath).If you plan to use local mode, please put -x local option in command line
	at org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.HExecutionEngine.init(HExecutionEngine.java:149)
	at org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.HExecutionEngine.init(HExecutionEngine.java:114)
	at org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext.connect(PigContext.java:177)
	at org.apache.pig.PigServer.<init>(PigServer.java:215)
	at org.apache.pig.PigServer.<init>(PigServer.java:204)
	at org.apache.pig.PigServer.<init>(PigServer.java:200)


The problem seems to be org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.HExecutionEngine: 148
            if( hadoop_site == null && core_site == null ) 
{
            	throw new ExecException("Cannot find hadoop configurations in classpath (neither hadoop-site.xml nor core-site.xml was found in the classpath)." +
            			"If you plan to use local mode, please put -x local option in command line", 
            			4010);
            }

We would like to use the mapreduce mode but with the minicluster and have a lot of unit test with that setup.

Can this check be removed from this level ?

Thanks
