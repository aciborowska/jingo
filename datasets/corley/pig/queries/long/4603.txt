In the constructor of SpillableMemoryManager, a NotificationListener is added to the MemoryMXBean. This listener is never removed, even if the application is re-deployed.

This results in the instance SpillableMemoryManager being still reachable after a redeploy. This results in its class being reachable, which results in the classloader being reachable, along with all the classes in it.

This leads to metaspace OutOfMemoryErrors.
