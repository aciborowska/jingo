The TOKENIZE function is a wrapper around the Java StringTokenizer class.  The delimiter argument is currently hard coded as " \",()*", and it is impossible to specify an alternative delimiter.  

The delimiter can be added as an optional argument to TOKENIZE which will preserve backwards compatibility while allowing users to specify their own delimiter chars.
