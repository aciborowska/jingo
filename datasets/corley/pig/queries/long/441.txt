Order by with desc works if you use a single reducer.  But with more than one reducer the partitions are not correctly constructed.  The SortParitioner uses the object comparators, not the raw the comparators.  The object comparators have no concept of order by descending.  So they build the partitions for ascending order.  The end result is data sorted descending within the partition but not across partitions.
