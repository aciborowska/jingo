We introduce column group name to Zebra and make it a first-class citizen in Zebra. This can ease management of column groups.
We plan to introduce an "as" clause for column group name in Zebra's syntax.

Functional Specifications:
1) Column group names are optional. For column groups which do not have a user-provided name, Zebra will assign some default column group names internally that is unique for that table - CG0, CG1, CG2 ... Note: If CGx is used by user, then it can not be used for internal names.

2) We introduce an "AS" clause in Zebra's syntax for column group names. If it occurs, it has to immediately follow [ ]. For example, "[a1, a2] as PI secure by user:joe group:secure perm:640; [a3, a4] as General compress by lzo". Note that keyword "AS" is case insensitive.

3) Column group names are unique within one table and are case sensitive, i.e., c1 and C1 are different.

4) Column group names will be used as the physical column group directory path names.

5) Zebra V2 will support dropColumnGroup by column group names (will integrate with Raghu's A29 drop column work).

6) Zebra V2 can support backward compatibility (If there are Zebra V1 created tables in production when V2 is released). More specifically, this means that Zebra V2 can load from V1-created tables and do dropColumnGroup on it.

7) Does NOT support renaming.
