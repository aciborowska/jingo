Currently, the size of combined splits can be configured by the pig.maxCombinedSplitSize property.

Although this works fine most of time, it can lead to a undesired situation where a single mapper ends up loading a lot of combined splits. Particularly, this is bad if Pig uploads them from S3.

So it will be useful if the max number of combined splits can be configured via a property something like pig.maxCombinedSplitNum.
