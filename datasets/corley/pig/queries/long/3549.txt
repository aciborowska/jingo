It would be better if we dump the hadoop job ids for failed, killed jobs in pig log. Right now, log looks like following-

ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt: ERROR 6017: Job failed! Error - NA
INFO org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.MapReduceLauncher: Job job_pigexec_1 killed


From that its hard to say which hadoop job failed if there are multiple jobs running in parallel.
