Currently it is simple for users to use a different TextInputFormat with PigStorage since PigStorage loader just expects one line at a time, takes care of parsing the text into a tuple.

This is not the case with storage side. PigTextOutputFormat handles the conversion to Text (it actually write UTF8 of each field from tuple directly to output). This implies a different TextOutputFormat can not be used with PigStorage.
