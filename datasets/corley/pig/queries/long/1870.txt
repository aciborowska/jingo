Projecting columns after LOAD via HBaseStorage produces unexpected results. This is related to the loadKey functionality and how the pushProjection method in HBaseStorage has to offset to build a column list that aligns with the tuple (the column list doesn't contain the row key).

This shift appears to create an inconsistency with the FieldSchema for the tuple which results in the wrong tuple value being fetched for a given column. I'll attach a patch with unit tests that illustrate the problem.
