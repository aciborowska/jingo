Some Operators, such as MergeCogroup, Stream, CollectedGroup etc buffer some input records to constitute the result tuples. The last result tuples are buffered in the operator.  These Operators need a flag to indicate the end of input, so that they can flush and constitute their last tuples.
Currently, the flag 'parentPlan.endOfAllInput' is targeted for flushing the buffered tuples in MR mode.  But it does not work with OutputConsumeIterator in Spark mode.
