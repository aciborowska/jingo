It will be a great help to users to show A) Line Number B) Actual Line in Pig Error Messages. Currently user has to copy/paste script line by line in Grunt to find out line that ran into a problem. For Grunt we can skip line number. 


Alternatively, we can assign line numbers in Grunt and show it in command prompt alongside "grunt>".  This could be a separate issue.
