I serached through the documentation but could not find a section that describes the cases under which combiner is used. Since combiner has such a significant impact on query performance, I think it is important to add this information. Also, with 0.9 we are expending combiner usage so having documentation would be useful for that as well.

Here are the JIRAs for combiner use slated for 0.9:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-750
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-490
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-946
