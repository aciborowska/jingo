The visitors used for explain and in MRCompiler do not guarantee order - hence the plan shown in explain output may not match the plan that is finally executed. This is not a bug but makes debugging harder. If the plan that is executed is different from the one in explain, it would still be the same in terms of semantics - the difference would only be in the order of inner plans and operators. It would be nice if we could have an order preserving way of showing explain output which would also be used to construct the plan (MRPlan) which is finally executed.
