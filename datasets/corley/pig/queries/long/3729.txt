Unable to get pig 0.12.0 to run single node pseudo distributed hadoop 2.2 cluster using the jar from mvnrepository.com 
this is the error

"org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.FrontendException: ERROR 1066: Unable to open iterator for alias"

if I download the jar from
http://apache.claz.org/pig/pig-0.12.0/pig-0.12.0.tar.gz  

and then recompile the src with  "ant clean jar -Dhadoopversion=23"  
when I install the recompiled  jar in .m2 everything works

If it is the case that the Apache hadoop 2.2.0 jars are backwardly compatible then could some one comment on what could be the issue?
