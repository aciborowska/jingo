The following query fails in 0.8:

A = load 'x' as (x:long, y:chararray);
B = load 'y' as (x:long, y:float);
C = union onschema A, B;

grunt> C = union onschema A, B;
2011-05-12 09:01:47,031 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 1031: Incompatible types for merging schemas. Field schema: y: chararray Other field schema: y: float

However, in 0.9 validation doesn't catch the error. It seems float is cast to chararray automatically.

grunt> describe C;
C: 
{x: long,y: chararray}
