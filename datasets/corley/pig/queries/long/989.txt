Currently, we do not allow type merge between numerical type and non-numerical type. And the error message is confusing. 

Eg, if you run:

a = load '1.txt' as (a0:chararray, a1:chararray);
b = load '2.txt' as (b0:long, b1:chararray);
c = join a by a0, b by b0;
dump c;

And the error message is "ERROR 1051: Cannot cast to Unknown"

We shall:
1. Allow the type merge between numerical type and non-numerical type
2. Or at least, provide more meaningful error message to the user
