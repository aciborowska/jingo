A simple pig script, that never introduces any schema information:

A = load 'foo';
B = foreach (group A by $8) generate group, COUNT($1);
C = load 'bar';       // ('bar' has two columns)
D = join B by $0, C by $0;
E = foreach D generate $0, $1, $3;

Fails, complaining that $3 does not exist:

java.io.IOException: Out of bound access. Trying to access non-existent column: 3. Schema 
{B::group: bytearray,long,bytearray}
 has 3 column(s).

Apparently Pig gets confused, and thinks it knows the schema for C (a single bytearray column).
