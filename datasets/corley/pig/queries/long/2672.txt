Pig currently copies jar files to a temporary location in hdfs and then adds them to DistributedCache for each job launched. This is inefficient in terms of 

	Space - The jars are distributed to task trackers for every job taking up lot of local temporary space in tasktrackers.
	Performance - The jar distribution impacts the job launch time.
