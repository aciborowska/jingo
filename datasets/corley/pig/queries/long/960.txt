PigStorage's reading of Tuples ( lines ) can be optimized using Hadoop's LineRecordReader.

This can help in following areas

	Improving performance reading of Tuples (lines) in PigStorage
	Any future improvements in line reading done in Hadoop's LineRecordReader is automatically carried over to Pig



Issues that are handled by this patch

	BZip uses internal buffers and positioning for determining the number of bytes read. Hence buffering done by LineRecordReader has to be turned off
	Current implementation of LocalSeekableInputStream does not implement available method. This method has to be implemented.
