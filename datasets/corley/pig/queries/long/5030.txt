"kill applicationId" does not work in general. Here is the existing code:

public void killJob(String jobID, Configuration conf) throws BackendException {
        if (runningJob != null && runningJob.getApplicationId().toString() == jobID) {
            try {
                runningJob.killJob();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                throw new BackendException(e);
            }
        } else {
            log.info("Cannot find job: " + jobID);
        }
    }


It only kill application the client launches. It is different than what we have in MapReduce.
