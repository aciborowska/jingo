I do PigServer.registerQuery("store ..."), and the query fails. Pig prints a bunch of stack traces but does not throw an error back to the caller. This is a major problem because my client needs to know whether the Pig command succeeded or failed.

I saw this problem with registerQuery() ... the same problem may arise with other PigServer methods as well, such as store(), copy(), etc. â€“ not sure.
