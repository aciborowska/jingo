There is currently no syntax to create a single-column tuple. For example, none of these work:

x = LOAD 'data.json' USING JsonLoader('a:chararray, b:chararray') AS (a:chararray, b:chararray);


	The goal is to create a relation containing a tuple with a single column
	For example: tpl: (value: chararray)
	Creates a relation with a single column "a" that is a chararray
a = foreach x generate (a) as (a: chararray); 
b = foreach x generate a as (a: chararray); 
c = foreach x generate a as a: chararray; 




	Python-style tuple syntax is a syntax error
d = foreach x generate (a,) as (a: chararray); 




	Types are incompatible
e = foreach x generate (a) as tuple(a: chararray)
