FLATTEN inside a foreach statement produces wrong results, if the input contains an empty bag.

A = load 'flatten.txt' as (a0:int, a1:bag{(t:chararray)});
B = group A by a0;
C = foreach B {
  c1 = foreach A generate FLATTEN(a1);
  generate COUNT(c1);
};


The easy workaround is to filter out empty bags.
