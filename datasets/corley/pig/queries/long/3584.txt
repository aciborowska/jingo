I found an issue this morning with AvroStorage and arrays of strings. Suppose that you have an Avro file with an array of strings like this:

{"name" : "example",
 "namespace" : "org.apache.pig.avro",
 "type" : "record",
 "fields" : [
 {"name" : "arrayOfStrings",
  "type" : "type" : "array", "items" : "string"}}

The current version of AvroStorage would translate this schema into a bag of tuples, each containing a single chararray field. 

The current version of AvroStorage will naively place each value in the array into a tuple inside a bag of values. Unfortunately, each value is a Utf8 item (not a Java String type). This can cause problems in later processing steps, because Pig does not know how to deal with Utf8 objects. 

I've written a patch for AvroStorage that will correctly translate objects in arrays into a form that Pig can process. (While I was at it, I made sure that we correctly translated other Avro types, including fixed, enums, and unions.)
