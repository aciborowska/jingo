The inspiration for this comes from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-2694. The idea is that instead of getting some hard to understand error, the e2e driver should make sure that all required fields are present (ie verify_pig_script and the like), and if its not, mention that. For the record, the current error you get it:

 ERROR TestDriver::run at : 470 Failed to run test Accumulator_1 <file not found: ./bin/pig at TestDriverPig.pm line 448


Which is basically meaningless...

I'm not terribly familiar with perl or I'd do this myself...
