While implementing TezExecutionEngine, I realized that a lot of code can be shared between MRExecutionEngine and TezExecutionEngine because both use the common Hadoop framework (hdfs, resource manager, etc). So it would make sense to create a base abstract class for them (called HExecutionEngine) and have them inherit common methods and fields from it.
