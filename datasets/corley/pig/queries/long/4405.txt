The mock/Storage contains convenience methods for creating a bag and a tuple when doing unit tests. Pig has however 3 complex data types ( see http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.14.0/basic.html#Simple+and+Complex ) and the third one (the map) is not yet present in such a convenience method.

Feature request: Add such a method to facilitate testing map[] output better.
