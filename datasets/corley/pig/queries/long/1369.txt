If a field (which is of type Tuple) in the data in null, POProject throws a NullPointerException. Also while projecting fields form a bag if a certain tuple in the bag does not contain a field being projected, an IndexOutofBoundsException is thrown. Since in a similar situation (accessing a non exisiting field in input tuple), POProject catches the IndexOutOfBoundsException and returns null, it should do the same for the above two cases and other cases where similar situations occur.
