IndexedTuple extends the DefaultTuple. This implementation might break in case we are trying to use a custom TupleFactory. Any special data in the custom tuples might get lost when we convert it to an IndexedTuple. The constructor does a super(t.getAll()), other non-datum attributes will be lost after this conversion. The indexedTuple must instead have Tuple as an attribute and implement the Tuple interface and delegate all the methods. The implementation should be by composition.
