When running Pig unit test, there are too many entires added to the classpath, and in some environment, results a bash "Argument list too long" exception.
In fact, lib/*.jar is added twice. One is explicitly in junit task, the other is injected the chain test.classpath->classpath->ivy.lib.dir. We need to remove lib/*.jar.
