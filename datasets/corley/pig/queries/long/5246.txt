we copy assembly jar to pig's classpath in spark1.6.

# Please specify SPARK_HOME first so that we can locate $SPARK_HOME/lib/spark-assembly*.jar,
# we will add spark-assembly*.jar to the classpath.

    if [ -z "$SPARK_HOME" ]; then
       echo "Error: SPARK_HOME is not set!"
       exit 1
    fi

    # Please specify SPARK_JAR which is the hdfs path of spark-assembly*.jar to allow YARN to cache spark-assembly*.jar on nodes so that it doesn't need to be distributed each time an application runs.
    if [ -z "$SPARK_JAR" ]; then
       echo "Error: SPARK_JAR is not set, SPARK_JAR stands for the hdfs location of spark-assembly*.jar. This allows YARN to cache spark-assembly*.jar on nodes so that it doesn't need to be distributed each time an application runs."

after upgrade to spark2.0, we may modify it
