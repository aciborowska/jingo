When we use pig in local mode and also have some config files that point to cluster (in the form of hadoop-site.xml) in the classpath, the local mode errs out saying it can't find the input file. This is because, when the local execution engine is being created, a new Configuration object is being created which takes properties from hadoop-site.xml while initializing. Because of this from then on it tries to connect to the settings in the hadoop-site.xml and fails to find the local files.

However, as we are in local mode we want this new Configuration to contain only properties from our pigContext. Currently, the configuration object doesn't support such a thing. We would actually want to initialize the Configuration with properties in hadoop-default.xml
