Pig 0.8/0.9 shows wrong stats for store counters when I have multiple store but of the same name.

To reproduce the issue please use the below script :

A = load 'sampledata1' as (f1:chararray,f2:chararray,f3:int);
B = filter A by f3==1;
C = filter A by f3==2;
D = filter A by f3==3;
store B into '/folder/B/out.gz';
store C into '/folder/C/out.gz';
store D into '/folder/D/out.gz';



Input 

aaa     a       1
aaa     b       1
bbb     a       2
bbb     b       2
ccc     a       3
ccc     b       3




For this script Pig shows 
Output(s):
Successfully stored 6 records (32 bytes) in: "/folder/B/out.gz"
Successfully stored 6 records (32 bytes) in: "/folder/C/out.gz"
Successfully stored 6 records (32 bytes) in: "/folder/D/out.gz"

Counters:
Total records written : 18
Total bytes written : 96
