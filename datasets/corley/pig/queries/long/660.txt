With Hadoop 0.20, it will be possible to query the status of each map and reduce in a map reduce job. This will allow better error reporting. Some of the other items that could be on Hadoop's feature requests/bugs are documented here for tracking.

1. Hadoop should return objects instead of strings when exceptions are thrown
2. The JobControl should handle all exceptions and report them appropriately. For example, when the JobControl fails to launch jobs, it should handle exceptions appropriately and should support APIs that query this state, i.e., failure to launch jobs.
