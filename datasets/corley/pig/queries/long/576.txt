Would be nice if I could write:

a = UNION b;       // evaluates to b
a = UNION;          // evaluates to empty set

... and similarly for other operators like JOIN.

This comes up when automatically generating Pig code for an embedded application. Currently I have to handle these as special cases in the code that generates the Pig commands, which is messy. Worse, as far as I know the empty-union case has no easy work-around â€“ I think I have to resort to creating an empty file and reading it to generate an empty relation.
