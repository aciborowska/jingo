Looks like we need to update the default HCAT_HOME in /bin/Pig to /usr/lib/hive-hcatalog.

This is what it has currently.

<snip>
if [ "$HCAT_HOME" == "" ]; then
  if [ -d "/usr/lib/hcatalog" ]; then
    HCAT_HOME=/usr/lib/hcatalog
  else
    echo "Please initialize HCAT_HOME"
    exit -1
  fi
  fi
