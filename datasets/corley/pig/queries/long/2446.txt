From hadoop 20.203+, HDFS_BYTES_READ change the meaning. It no longer means the size of input files, it is the total hdfs bytes read for the job. Pig need a way to get the map input bytes to retain the old behavior.

TestPigRunner.testGetHadoopCounters is testing that and is temporary disabled for hadoop 203+.
