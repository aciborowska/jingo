Currently pig always does a multi-pass order by where it first determines a distribution for the keys and then orders in a second pass.  This avoids the necessity of having a single reducer.  However, in cases where the data is small enough to fit into a single reducer, this is inefficient.  For small data sets it would be good to realize the small size of the set and do the order by in a single pass with a single reducer.
