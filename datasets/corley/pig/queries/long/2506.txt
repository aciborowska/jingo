These builtins should respond to lowercase form as well.  I am tired of writing ugly upper case Pig.  My friends make fun of me.  My partner says I write code just like my Dad's SQL.  Cascading fans make fun of my upper case L's and P's.  I just don't want to write uppercase Pig anymore.  I just can't do it.
