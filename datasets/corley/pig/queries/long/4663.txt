The HBase client Scan API offers a way to setMaxResultsPerColumnFamily.  This number prevents all the columns from being consumed when scanning a row.  If you have a single row with several thousand columns on it, Pig will likely fail giving an OutOfMemoryException or ScannerTimeoutException.

The suggestion is to add the option '-maxResultsPerColumnFamily' which can be passed as an optString parameter in the constructor, which sets this value on the HBase Scan.
