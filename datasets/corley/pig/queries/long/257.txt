This very cool idea sprang out from a discussion in mailing-list (Thanks Manish Shah)

There is a semantic issue that Hadoop Input Format generally expects K,V but Pig expects Tuple. We can solve this by sticking K,V as fields in Tuple. 

Provided that we've got rich built-in string/binary manipulation functions, Hadoop users shouldn't find it too costly to use Pig. This should definitely help accelerate Pig adoption process.

After a brief look at the current code, this new feature will require changes in Map Reduce execution engine so I will wait until the type branch is complete before start working on this (If nobody expresses interest in doing it  )
