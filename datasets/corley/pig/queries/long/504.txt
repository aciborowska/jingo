For the snippet of code which runs on the latest types branch. (utf8.txt attached)

A = load 'utf8.txt' using PigStorage() as (t1: chararray);
illustrate A;



results in this output being produced
-------------------------------



 A     
 t1: bytearray cn: 1

-------------------------------

Three observations:
1) text should be chararray, not bytearray.
2) cn: 1 should be removed from the display
3) Value for text is "username??" is not displayed properly

Now replacing illustrate with dump

A = load 'utf8.txt' using PigStorage() as (t1: chararray);
dump A;

The utf8 characters after username are not displayed correctly but instead substituted by ?.
