1) Need a new setting pig.bloomjoin.nocombiner to turn off combiner for bloom join. When the keys are all unique, the combiner is unnecessary overhead.
2) In previous case, the keys were the bloom filter index and the values were the join key. Combining involved doing a distinct on the bag of values which has memory issues for more than 10 million records. That needs to be flipped and distinct combiner used to scale to a billions of records.
3) Mention in documentation that bloom join is also ideal in cases of right outer join with smaller dataset on the right. Replicate join only supports left outer join.
