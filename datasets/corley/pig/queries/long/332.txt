Script :


a = load '/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k' using PigStorage() as (name:chararray, age:int, gpa:float);
b = filter a by  name == 'fred allen' and age == 61 and gpa == 1.42;
store b into '/user/pig/tests/results/FilterEq_7.out' using PigStorage;



Result has 0 rows when infact there should be 1 row.

The reason is within Pig code in POCast, we do 

res.result = new Double(((Float)res.result).doubleValue());



to promote the column to a double. As a results of the above code, the precisions don't match and hence the filter throws away the row.

This could be treated as "Working as designed" and the user may need to explicity do gpa == 1.42f - just wanted it to be discussed and pointed out in the 2.0 release notes.
