Currently, set command can set the value of a variable, or show all variables along with value. I'd like to add another form which show the value of a particular variable. For example:
>set fs.defaultFS (show value of fs.defaultFS).

That will help us debug a Pig session in a cleaner way (as compare to show all variables).
