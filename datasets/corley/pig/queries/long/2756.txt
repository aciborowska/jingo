Tracking areas where we need documentation on the pig.apache.org site (Javadocs are typically pretty good). We can open child tasks as needed. Please add to the list if you know of others.


	Pluggable PigProgressNotificationListener isn't in the docs
	Pluggable reducer estimators (see PIG-2574)
	ILLUSTRATE seems to have dropped off the docs
