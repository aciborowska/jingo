In a replicated join if a huge relation is mentioned wrongly on the right side, the job may start filling up the disks and eventually impact the overall cluster.

Furthermore, the document for replicated join says,
"The small relations must be small enough to fit into main memory; if they don't, the process fails and an error is generated."

It would be nice to have a mechanism to fail fast this sort of scenarios or may be have some warning messages to notify this.
