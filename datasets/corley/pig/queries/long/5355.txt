The logic for padding the current row does not consider the updated padded row during the comparison. It ends up with different length then expected. This results in negative value for processed.



            byte[] lastPadded = currRow_;
            if (currRow_.length < endRow_.length) {
                lastPadded = Bytes.padTail(currRow_, endRow_.length - currRow_.length);
            }
            if (currRow_.length < startRow_.length) {
                lastPadded = Bytes.padTail(currRow_, startRow_.length - currRow_.length);
            }

            byte [] prependHeader = {1, 0};
            BigInteger bigLastRow = new BigInteger(Bytes.add(prependHeader, lastPadded));
            if (bigLastRow.compareTo(bigEnd_) > 0) {
                return progressSoFar_;
            }
            BigDecimal processed = new BigDecimal(bigLastRow.subtract(bigStart_));


The fix is to use lastPadded in the second if comparison and Bytes.padTail call inside that if

PIG-4700 added progress reporting. This enabled ProgressHelper in Tez. It calls getProgress here  on PigRecrodReader https://github.com/apache/pig/blob/trunk/src/org/apache/pig/backend/hadoop/executionengine/mapReduceLayer/PigRecordReader.java#L159 . Since Pig is reporting negative progress, job is getting killed by AM.
