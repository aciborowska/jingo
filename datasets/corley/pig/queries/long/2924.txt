Using PigStatsUtil (like Oozie does) to collect JobStats for jobs that use a HBaseStorage blows up when the stats are asked to be accumulated.

This is because JobStats (which adds stuff up) is assuming all storages are file based and that it can do listStatus/etc. operations on their filespec-provided filename. For HBaseStorage, this is set to the tablename and there's no such file, leading to an exception (FileNotFound or Invalid URI - depending on using 'tablename' or 'hbase://tablename').
