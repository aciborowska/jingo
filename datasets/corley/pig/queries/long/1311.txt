Clearly marking Pig interfaces (Java interfaces but also things like config files, CLIs, Pig Latin syntax and semantics, etc.) to show scope (public/private) and stability (stable/evolving/unstable) will help users understand how to interact with Pig and developers to understand what things they can and cannot change.
