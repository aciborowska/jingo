Consider the following scenario :-
1. Multi-level splits in the map plan.
2. Each split branch further progressing across a local-global rearrange.
3. Output of each of these finally merged via a UNION.

MultiQuery optimizer throws the following error in such a case:
"ERROR 2146: Internal Error. Inconsistency in key index found during optimization."
