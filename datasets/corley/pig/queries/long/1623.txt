All of the following register statements parse


register /Users/gates/tmp/pig-0.7/pig-0.7.0/./contrib/piggybank/java/piggybank.jar
register '/Users/gates/tmp/pig-0.7/pig-0.7.0/./contrib/piggybank/java/piggybank.jar'
register '/Users/gates/tmp/pig-0.7/pig-0.7.0/./contrib/piggybank/java/piggybank.jar';



As far as I know register is the only Pig Latin command that does not require a semicolon at the end.  It is also the only command that allows unquoted strings for file paths.  We should align this with other similar syntax in Pig Latin.

I order to avoid breaking existing scripts we may need to warn about this behavior for a while before no longer supporting it.
