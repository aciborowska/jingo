This example has a correct behavior. 

in = LOAD '$INFILE' USING AvroStorage('','-f schema.avsc');
out = FOREACH in GENERATE *;

But if we try to pick and project specific fields like the following example,

in = LOAD '$INFILE' USING AvroStorage('','-f schema.avsc');
out = FOREACH in GENERATE $0,$1,$7;

Actual result is "$0, $1, $2" not "$0,$1,$7"

This bug is always reproducible.
