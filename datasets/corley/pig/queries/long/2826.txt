The training link on Pig's website used to point to a Pig specific video on Cloudera's site.  It now points to a list of all their videos.  Also, at the time they were the only ones providing training videos for Hadoop.  Now other vendors do as well.  This link should be replaced by a link to a wiki page where vendors who wish to can list their training resources.
