   While bytes comparator cannot be used for joins till TEZ-2715 is available, they can be used for group by and distinct if they have only one Tez input. If there is more than one input due to union optimization (OrderedGroupedMergedKVInput) , full comparator has to be still used as OrderedGroupedMergedKVInput uses the comparator to merge the two underlying inputs.
