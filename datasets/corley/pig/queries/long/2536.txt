Currently, pig does not allow this syntax:

A = load 'thing' (x:int, y:int, z:int);
B = distinct A.x;
C = distinct A.(y,z)
D = distinct C.$0;



and so on. With this patch, it does. I should probably add more tests, though it's a simple patch... it just turns distinct rel.proj into syntactic sugar for distinct (foreach rel generate proj)
