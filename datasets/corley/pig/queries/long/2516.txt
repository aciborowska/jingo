Like fs command,  sh command failure should result in query failure when run in batch mode. In interactive mode it should result in a warning.

Also, sh command parsing seems to be faulty, according to Daniel, parser generated by PigScriptParser.jj would result in sh command using GetPath(), ie all sh commands might not be working.
