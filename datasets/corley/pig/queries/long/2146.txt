The below is my script;

register piggybank.jar;
a = load 'myinput' using PigStorage(',') as (f1:chararray,f2:chararray,f3:chararray);
b = distinct a;
c = limit b 2;
store c into 'pss001' using org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.PigStorageSchema();



Input
-------
a,1,aa
b,2,bb
c,3,cc


For this script , PigStorageSchema is not generating  .pig_headers and .pig_schema files. While debugging I could see that storeSchema(..) method itself is not invoked.The schema object for the store is returned as  null (POStore.getSchema()) because of which PigOutputCommitter is not invoking the storSchema.

The same schema object is valid when I run it in local mode. This issue is happening for Pig 0.9 also.
