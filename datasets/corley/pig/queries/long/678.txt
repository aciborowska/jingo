I should be able to use "as" with GROUP the same way I use it with LOAD, i.e. rename the entire schema. This is especially important b/c the system automatically assigns schema names for the output of group that many people find unintuitive.

e.g. this should work:

grouped = GROUP data BY url AS (url, history);
