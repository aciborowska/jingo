When running a very large query a user got the following error after 90 minutes:

org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.Launcher
>> - Error message from task (reduce) tip_200810072143_0004_r_000033Task
>> task_200810072143_0004_r_000033_0 failed to report status for 600 
>> seconds. Killing!

Looks like we missed reporting progress in a few places.
