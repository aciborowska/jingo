M/R requires more accurate progress status. It should be based on number of rows. For unsorted tables, this data is readily available as each mapper calculates the number of rows based upon its split. However, for sorted tables, this number of rows is not used and therefore will need to be calculated from the TFile scanner working on a key range. This TFile functionality is unfortunately unavailable now and will be needed to support this functionality.
