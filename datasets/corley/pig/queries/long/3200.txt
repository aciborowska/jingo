MiniCluster creates hadoop-site.xml under build/classes which is used by Pig tests in creating a (mini) hadoop cluster to run against. 

MiniCluster.buildCluster() deletes this file from previous run before re-generating it. However, this config file is not deleted when mini-cluster is shutdown. This can sometimes lead to unpredictable behavior when hadoop-site.xml is not expected on classpath (See PIG-3135). 

The cleanest operation would be to delete this file when the mini-cluster is shutdown.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the issue
