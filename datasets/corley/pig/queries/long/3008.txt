This JIRA exists mainly to get a conversation started. We've talked about it before, and it's a tricky issue. That said, some of the Pig code is super, super gnarly. We need some sort of path that will let it eventually be fix-able.

I posit: any file that hasn't been touched for over 6 months is eligible for a whitespace patch.
