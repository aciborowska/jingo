Pig handling bzip within its own codebase. I am not very sure but that's probably due to history reason. Hadoop does not support splittable bzip until 0.21 (HADOOP-4012). If so, we shall remove the bzip2 module in Pig and delegate to Hadoop.

In particular, Pig does not support bzip2 concatenation. Once we delegate bzip to Hadoop, this issue will be solved.
