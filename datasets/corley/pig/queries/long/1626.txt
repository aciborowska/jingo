The current documentation just states: "The COUNT function ignores NULL values. If you want to include NULL values in the count computation, use COUNT_STAR. "

The new text should be something like

"The COUNT function follows syntax semantics and ignores nulls. What this means is that a tuple in the bag will not be counted if the first field in this tuple is NULL. If you want to include NULL values in the count computation, use COUNT_STAR. "
