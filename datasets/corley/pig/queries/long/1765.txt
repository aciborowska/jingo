In new parser changes, the following statements are treated as same -

f = foreach l generate a as aa :int;      – here the column is now called aa and has type int

f = foreach l generate a as (aa :int);   – this should mean that the column has type "tuple with column aa of type int" 

With old parser the 2nd statement results in syntax error, which is fine, because it requires name part . 

The parenthesis represent tuple in pig.  We should deprecate support for load statement that takes schema without the parenthesis part , such as following example -
l = load 'x' as a:int – It should be as (a :int) , it is treated as such but this is inconsistent syntax.
