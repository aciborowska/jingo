XMLLoaderBufferedPositionedInputStream caches passed InputStream and then uses it to read. At the same time the stream is bufferent in super construcor. So cached version is unbuffered.

Also using cached version makes getPosition() call return invalid values and forces XMLLoaderBufferedPositionedInputStream maintain it's own counter.

I did add some fixes here: https://github.com/apache/pig/pull/5/files
