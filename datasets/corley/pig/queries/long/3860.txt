PIG-3829 handles some cases, but NPE can be still thrown for custom counters in Tez mode. For example, the following query fails with NPE-

SET opt.fetch false;
SET pig.udf.profile true;
a = LOAD 'foo' AS (x:chararray);
b = FOREACH a GENERATE LOWER(x);
DUMP b;



The problem is that PigStatusReport.getInstance().getCounter() returns null since TezStatusReporter is used in Tez.

PigStatusReporter.getInstance().getCounter(counterGroup, INVOCATION_COUNTER).increment(TIMING_FREQ);
