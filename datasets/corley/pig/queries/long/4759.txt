  We had left it as a known issue to be fixed later as that was a very odd and uncommon usage put in just for the particular testcase - store into a file with one StoreFunc, but read back with a different reader in the same script. But came across one of our user doing that same case. Storing bags using PigStorage and reading back with TextLoader and processing them as plain strings later on.
