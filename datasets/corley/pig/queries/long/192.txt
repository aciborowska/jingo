I got "broken pipe" exceptions if the streaming script/binary does not read from STDIN.  I would expect the streaming still to come through.  For instance, on the shell command line I can issue:


     cat input.txt | PigLoggingTest 10 f



and this does not generate any error even though PigLoggingTest in this case does not read from STDIN at all.

However, if I use the same command in Pig streaming I get "broken pipe".


A = load '../../singlefile/studenttab10k';
B = stream A through `PigLoggingTest 10 f` as (name, age, gpa); 
store B into 'results_14';
