It looks like the pig shell script in v0.11 exports PIG_HOME without first checking to see if it already exists.

from line 78 in <path>/bin/pig:
# the root of the Pig installation
export PIG_HOME=`dirname "$this"`/..

The supplied patch checks to see if the env has already been set prior to setting.
