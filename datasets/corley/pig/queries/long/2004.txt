The below script fails by throwing a ClassCastException from the MAX udf. The udf expects the value of the bag supplied to be databyte array, but at run time the udf gets the actual type, ie Double in this case.  This causes the script execution to fail with exception;




 Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Double cannot be cast to org.apache.pig.data.DataByteArray






The same script runs properly with Pig 0.8.




A = LOAD 'myinput' as (f1,f2,f3);
B = foreach A generate f1,f2+f3/1000.0 as doub;
C = group B by f1;
D = foreach C generate (long)(MAX(B.doub)) as f4;
dump D;
