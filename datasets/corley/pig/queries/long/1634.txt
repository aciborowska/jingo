I am hoping that in Pig if I type 

 c = cogroup a by foo, b by bar", the fields c.group, c.foo  and c.bar should all map to c.$0  

This would improve the readability  of the Pig script.

Here's a real usecase:

---
pages = LOAD 'pages.dat'  AS (url, pagerank);

visits = LOAD 'user_log.dat'  AS (user_id, url);

page_visits = COGROUP pages BY url, visits BY url;

frequent_visits = FILTER page_visits BY COUNT(visits) >= 2;

answer = FOREACH frequent_visits  GENERATE url, FLATTEN(pages.pagerank);
---



(The important part is the final GENERATE statement, which references   the field "url", which was the grouping field in the earlier COGROUP.)  To get it  to work I have to write it in a less intuitive way.

Maybe with the new parser changes in Pig 0.9 it would be easier to specify that.
