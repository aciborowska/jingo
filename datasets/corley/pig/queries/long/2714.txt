The following documentation gives a picture that the columns are indexed from 1 but is actually indexed from 0.

http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.8.1/piglatin_ref2.html#TOP

Specifically on the sample code snippet
result = TOP(10, 2, C); // and retain top 10 occurrences of 'second' in first

'second' is the second column, in that case we need to have the TOP function as TOP(10, 1, C) instead of TOP(10, 2, C)
