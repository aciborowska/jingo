The Pig philosophy page says several things that are no longer true (such as that Pig does not have an optimizer (it does now), that we someday hope to support streaming (we already do), that we some day hope to control splits (we don't, we just use what Hadoop gives us now)).  These need to be updated to reflect the current situation.
