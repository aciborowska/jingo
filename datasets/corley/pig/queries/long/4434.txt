Tez auto-parallelism currently has some limitation:
1. ShuffledVertexManager only decrease parallelism not increase
2. Pig currently exaggerate parallelism at frontend, ShuffledVertexManager might get initial parallelism way large than actual, that would be costly

Instead of that, we can gradually adjust initial vertex parallelism at runtime once upstream vertexes finishes.
