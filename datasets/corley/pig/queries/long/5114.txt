I am using 2 virtual machines where 1 is hadoop master and another is hadoop slave. I have installed HBase 1.1.4 in distributed mode . and then pig 15 is installed in master. Now I open pig in mapreduce mode and load a txt file from hdfs and then dump it , I get error unable to iterate alias. 
But in local mode dump is working fine.
It is also to mention that I did 
ant clean tar -Dhadoopversion=23 -Dhbase95.version=1.1.2 -Dforrest.home=/home/hduser/forrest/apache-forrest-0.9 

Build was successful, still getting error. Kindly help.
