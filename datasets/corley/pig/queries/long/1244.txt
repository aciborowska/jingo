Currently parameter syntax in pig scripts is $VAR.

This complicates scripts as parameter-literal concatenation is not supported. For example:

An occurrence of '$OUT_tmp' in a script resolves to a parameter 'OUT_tmp', it would be desirable this to resolve to a contactenation of $OUT&_tmp

This can be solved by supporting parameter syntax ${VAR}, so the pig parser can identify the end of the parameter name.

Adding support for ${VAR} syntax in addition of $VAR would maintain backwards compatibility. Changing to syntax ${VAR} syntax will break backwards compatibility.
