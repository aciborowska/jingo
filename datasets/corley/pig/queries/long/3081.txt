  We are seeing that for many scripts if there are multiple jobs in the job graph, progress stays at 0% for the first job and jumps to 33% when the first job completes. There is no intermediate progress. After that intermediate progress gets reported for the subsequent jobs. Noticed this with jobs that do filtering and order by.
