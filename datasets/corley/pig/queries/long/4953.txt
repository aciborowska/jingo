While testing PIG-4940, I noticed that a "is not null" predicate was not pushed down, but equality predicates were. The problem is that the FilterExtractor#visit method ignores anything that isn't a BinaryExpression. Pushing down UnaryExpression filters works if the expression is linked in by a binary expression, like "b is not null and c == 'val'".
