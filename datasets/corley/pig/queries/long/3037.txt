Why doesn't PIG support partition by on order by?

If PIG would then PIG could be used for a mess of windowing functions.  

Is there some reason why we can't add a custom partitioner on a order by operation?

Is there a work around to do windowing in PIG.  

I understand the I can group and then order with in a group, but what if the items with in the group are super big will I have memory issues?  Because I need to order the values with in a group.  i.e. stock tickers is the group and they need to be sorted on time.
