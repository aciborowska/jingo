e.g Group by followed by join on the same key  
This can be done in one vertex with multiple inputs instead of having an extra vertex to do the join. i.e Currently Vertex 1 (load relation1) > Vertex 2 (group by) -> Vertex 4 (join) < Vertex 3 (load relation 2). This could be changed to Vertex 1 (load relation1) > Vertex 2 (group by and join) < Vertex 3 (load relation 2)

And idea of this kind of optimization from YSmart that hive already integrate it. Now pig has already integrate tez, so it would be natural to integrate YSmart into pig on tez.
