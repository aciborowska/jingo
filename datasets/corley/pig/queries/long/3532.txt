Currently run a Pig script with empty plan fail:
a = load 'input.txt';
b = group a by a0;
store b into 'ooo';

Non empty plan works:
a = load 'input.txt' as (a0:chararray);
b = group a by a0;
c = foreach b generate group, COUNT(a) as count;
d = group c by count;
store d into 'ooo';

Put a simple patch contains the fix.
