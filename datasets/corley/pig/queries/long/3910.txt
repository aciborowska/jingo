When trying to use a 'DUMP' command inside Macros, I get a syntax error:
ERROR 1200: <file /tmp/pig-plugin/Ory/1398254029560/ORY_macros.pig, line 27> Failed to parse macro 'num_and_dump'. Reason: <file /tmp/pig-plugin/Ory/1398254029560/ORY_macros.pig, line 3, column 0>  Syntax error, unexpected symbol at or near 'DUMP'

I have found one reference on the web to this being due to issues between PigLatin parser and Grunt parser, but that was 2 years ago and I can find no further information on this.
