Our schema parser doesn't allow "null" alias but we have to be able to do that in Dot test files.
This is a work around by introducing "[NoAlias]" keyword in schema definition just for Dot LogicalPlanLoader.

Sample:-

foreach [  key="20", type="LOForEach" , schema="[NoAlias] : long, [NoAlias] : byteArray"    ] ;



At runtime, [NoAlias] will be substituted by dummy column names before being sent to the parser. Subsequently those names will be replaced by "null". There is no changes in the actual query parser.
