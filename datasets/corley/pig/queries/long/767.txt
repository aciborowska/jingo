The following script:

urlContents = LOAD 'inputdir' USING BinStorage() AS (url:bytearray, pg:bytearray);
â€“ describe and dump are in-sync
DESCRIBE urlContents;
DUMP urlContents;

urlContentsG = GROUP urlContents BY url;
DESCRIBE urlContentsG;

urlContentsF = FOREACH urlContentsG GENERATE group,urlContents.pg;

DESCRIBE urlContentsF;
DUMP urlContentsF;


Prints for the DESCRIBE commands:

urlContents: 
{url: chararray,pg: chararray}
urlContentsG: {group: chararray,urlContents: {url: chararray,pg: chararray}}
urlContentsF: {group: chararray,pg: {pg: chararray}}

The reported schemas for urlContentsG and urlContentsF are wrong. They are also against the section "Schemas for Complex Data Types" in http://wiki.apache.org/pig-data/attachments/FrontPage/attachments/plrm.htm#_Schemas.

As expected, actual data observed from DUMP urlContentsG and DUMP urlContentsF do contain the tuple inside the inner bags.

The correct schema for urlContentsG is:  {group: chararray,urlContents: {t1:(url: chararray,pg: chararray)}}

This may sound like a technicality, but it isn't. For instance, a UDF that assumes an inner bag of 
{chararray}
 will not work with 
{(chararray)}
.
