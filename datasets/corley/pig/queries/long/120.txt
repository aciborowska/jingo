Currently pig support mapreduce and local as execution modes. LocalExecutionEngine is used for local and HExecutionEngine for map reduce. HExecutionEngine always expect that hadoop runs as cluster with a name node and jobtracker listing on a port. 
Though, hadoop can also run in a local mode (LocalJobRunner) this would give several advantages. 
First it would speed up the test suite significant. Second it would be possible to debug map reduce plans easily.
For example we was able to debug and reproduce PIG-110 with this method.
