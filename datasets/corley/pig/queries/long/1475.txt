I'm generating reports using Pig where I only want to report on rows matching a set of regular expressions, but those regular expressions are pretty numerous.

Pig fails with this internal error when I run FILTER with 500 terms:

2010-06-29 15:46:04,579 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 2998: Unhandled internal error. null

This only occurred when I ran my Pig script against Hadoop with the full dataset. When I ran Pig in local mode, with a smaller sample file, Pig handled the FILTER command just fine.

The workaround has been to split my list into two separate lists of 250 then UNION the results, but I assume this is something that could be addressed in the code.
