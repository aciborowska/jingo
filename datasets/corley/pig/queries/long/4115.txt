Running a Pig Action in Oozie : 


CentOS

	mv /etc/localtime /etc/localtime.mv #backup your current tz
	ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Zurich /etc/localtime # set tz to Europe/Zurich




	create a hdfs://tmp/file.txt in hdfs with content "1"
In Pig do:
A = load '/tmp/file.txt' as (a:chararray);
B = foreach A generate *, ToDate('02/11/1940', 'dd/MM/yyyy') ;
dump B;




In Oozie Pig Action, 
produce the same script in in workflow.xml and execute
this is where it'll fail.

Since Oozie is using Pig as a library, I believe they should behave the same.

We notice this inconsistency, when the OS is set to
$ date +%Z # timezone name
