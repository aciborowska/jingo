Having a newline between GENERATE and a deep cast like (bag
{tuple(long)}) causes a syntax error.

For example:

grunt> a = load '/etc/passwd' using PigStorage(':') as (foo, bar);
grunt> b = foreach a generate  (bag{tuple(long)}
) foo;

Works. But this causes a syntax error:

grunt> b = foreach a generate                           
>> (bag
{tuple(long)}
) foo;
