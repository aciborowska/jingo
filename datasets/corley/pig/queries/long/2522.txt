I'm mostly entering this Jira to make you aware that the deprecated pig api's to access hdfs (typically thru grunt) do not work consistently with federation.
The hadoop references suported in grunt do work and can be used.

It should at a minimum be noted in the documentation that the deprecated api's do not work with client side tables.
