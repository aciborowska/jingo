Create a Pigmix sample dataset which looks as follow:
keren	1	2	qt	3	4	5.0	a�aaa�b�bbb	mc�ccc�d�ddd�e�eee�d�mf�fff�g�ggg�h�hhh

Launch the following query:
A = load 'page_views_sample.txt' using org.apache.pig.test.pigmix.udf.PigPerformanceLoader()
    as (user, action, timespent, query_term, ip_addr, timestamp, estimated_revenue, page_info, page_links);
store A into 'L1out_A';

B = foreach A generate user, (int)action as action, (map[])page_info as page_info, flatten((bag
{tuple(map[])}
)page_links) as page_links;
store B into 'L1out_B';

The result looks like this: 
keren	1	b#bbb,a#aaa	d#,e#eee,c#ccc
keren	1	b#bbb,a#aaa	[f#fff,g#ggg,h#hhh

It is missing the 'ddd' value and a closing bracket.

Thanks,
Keren
