The syntax proposed is the following:

RANK <alias> (BY (<col_ref>|<col_range>)+)?

Which now is running on the patch attached with the code implemented so far, with the corresponding tests.

And small update to the syntax:

RANK <alias> (BY (<col_ref>|<col_range>)+)? DENSE

I append "DENSE" for dense rank implementation.

Looking forward to reading your comments.
