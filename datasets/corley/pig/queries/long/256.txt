pig does not support non default constructor with variable number of arguments support. In our case we need this because the number of variables that are specified by the user are varying. The fix is simple. Pig calls getConstr("agr1","arg2",...,"argn") and if it doesn't find it throws a noSuchMethodFound exception. In the catch block we just need to add code to check if we can wrap the arg1..n in a String[] and check if a constructor can be found with this signature getConstr(args[]). This would resolve the variable num args issue.
