Currently grunt works with FileSystem class which is too low level. We should be using FsShell class that provides shell like interface. though we do need to make sure that current semantics of all grunt commands are preserved.

Additional benefits, that we can enable use of trash from grunt as well as addition of new commands: head and tail. (Head will depend on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-3540).
