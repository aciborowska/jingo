The following script does not set signature correctly when we call LoadFunc.getSchema.

a = load 'xxx' using TableLoader('xxx') as (a, b, c);

However, if we don't give schema to a, we get the right signature:

a = load 'xxx' using TableLoader('xxx);

Diagnosis:
Parser will generate LoadClause before go to the generation "Alias = LoadClause", which actually set signature to the LOLoad. When we give a schema, parser try to call LOLoad.setSchema(), internally it will call LoadFunc.determineSchema. And at that time, signature has not been set yet. 

This relates to the change we cache determinedSchema in LOLoad PIG-1317. Before that change, we will later call LoadFunc.getSchema() again using the right signature. Now we cache determinedSchema, so LoadFunc don't have a chance to get the right signature inside LoadFunc.getSchema()

Solution:
We shall not call LoadFunc.determineSchema inside LOLoad.setSchema().
