This may be a niche use case, but this is a simple change that may be useful to others.

When jobs are started from a network not local to the the Hadoop cluster, the upload of the job jars can take a significant amount of time. This can be ameliorated by preinstalling large libraries on the Hadoop slaves. However, there are certain jars (or parts of jars, e.g., the pig classes) that cannot be skipped using the existing PigContext.skipJars functionality, since when specific packages are specified, skipJars are not skipped.
