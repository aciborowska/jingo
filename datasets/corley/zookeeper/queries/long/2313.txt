Following the work on ZOOKEEPER-2142, the goal of this ticket is to add a new constructor to ZooKeeperServerBean to pass the name as the parameter, so classes that extend from ZooKeeperServerBean shouldn't need to implement getName() method. Also, ObserverBean seems to be in the wrong package, it should be under server.quorum rather than just server.
