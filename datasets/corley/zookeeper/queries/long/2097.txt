According to the Programmer's Guide:

Everyone implicitly has LOOKUP permission. This allows you to stat a node, but nothing more. (The problem is, if you want to call zoo_exists() on a node that doesn't exist, there is no permission to check.)

This implies that Exists has no security requirement, so the existing comment in FinalRequestProcessor

// TODO we need to figure out the security requirement for this!

can be removed.
