ASyncHammerTest is failing intermittently on hudson trunk. There is no clear reason why this is happening, but
it seems from the logs that a session connection to a follower is failing during session establishment - the
failure seems to be a problem either on the follower or leader. The server gets the session create request, but
it stalls in the request processor pipeline. (we see it go in, but we do not see it com eout)

unfortunately all efforts to reproduce this on non-hudson trunk have failed. Even trying to reproduce by
running on hudson host itself (manually) has failed.

We need to instrument the client session creation code in the test to dump the thread stack if the
session creation fails.
