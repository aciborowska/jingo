In a 5-node ZK cluster setup, in the following state:

	1 host is down / not reachable.
	4 hosts are up.
	3 ZK servers are in quorum.
	a 4th ZK server was restarted and is trying to re-join the quorum.



The 4th server is not able to rejoin the quorum because the connection to the host that is not established, and apparently takes to long to timeout.

Stack traces and additional information coming.
