DeleteRecursive has been committed to trunk already as a method to the 
zookeeper class. So in the API it has the same level as the atomic operations 
create, delete, getData, setData, etc. The user must get the false impression, 
that deleteRecursive is also an atomic operation.
It would be better to have deleteRecursive in some helper class but not that 
deep in zookeeper's core code. Maybe I'd like to have another policy on how to 
react if deleteRecursive fails in the middle of its work?
