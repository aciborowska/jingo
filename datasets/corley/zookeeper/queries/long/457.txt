hi folks, we have made some changes to zookeeper to facilitate providing an embedded zk client in our own hbase client.  This will allow our users to use 1 shell to manipulate both hbase things and zookeeper things.  It requires making a few things public, and in the process rearranging how some static things are initialized.  

It's fairly trivial refactoring, hopefully you guys approve!

Thanks!
