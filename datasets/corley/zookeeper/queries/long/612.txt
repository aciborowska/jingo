The original C Client, Version 3.2.1, cannot be compiled successfully by the gcc of early version, due some declaration restriction. To compile the source code on the server with gcc of early version, I made some modification on the original source. What's more, some extra codes are added to make the client be compatible with the hosts list format: ip1:port1, ip2:port2... There is often a space after this kind of comma.
