It is currently easy to know how many entries a ledger has, but there is no easy way to know the total number of bytes in a ledger. The idea of this jira is to add a method that gives the number of bytes in a closed ledger. My current idea is to simply have the writer counting the number of bytes written and store it to ZooKeeper.
