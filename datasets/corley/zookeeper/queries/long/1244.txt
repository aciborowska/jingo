The ZooKeeper main codebase, including tests, currently triggers only 5 warnings in eclipse. The remaining 5 warnings should be fixed by people knowing these classes better then me.
Once the warnings are down to zero it could be made a policy to keep it that way.

The contrib loggraph however has around 300 warnings, many of them missing generics.
