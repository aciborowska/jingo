It seems like in FastLeaderElection#Messenger#WorkerReceiver the main loop should be left immediately after this path [0] is taken:


                                       if (!rqv.equals(curQV)) {
                                           LOG.info("restarting leader election");
                                           self.shuttingDownLE = true;
                                           self.getElectionAlg().shutdown();
                                       }



Instead, it keeps going which means the received message would still be applied and a new message might be send out. Should there be a break statement right after self.getElectionAlg().shutdown()?

Any ideas Alexander Shraer?
