Giri, can you take a look at this:

1) looks like autoreconf is always run, which means that a re-configure/re-make is run each time the tests are run using ant

2) tabs were introduced to the build when cppunit changes were made, please only use spaces (would be great if you could fix this too â€“ hard to read in my editor)

Thanks!
