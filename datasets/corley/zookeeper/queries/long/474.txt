This patch adds compile and test targets to the zkperl build.xml, and tweaks the package target a little to use the manifest file.

For me, "ant compile", "ant test", and "ant clean" all work (from scratch, in each case) when using Ant in the local src/contrib/zkperl directory.

Further, "ant package" in the top-level directory seems to continue to build zkperl along with everything else, and leaves out the build.xml and t/zkServer.sh files, which is appropriate.

From what I can see, the top-level build.xml doesn't actually invoke the test-contrib target, so I'm not sure if there's a way to integrate the zkperl tests into the main hudson automated test process, but that would be ideal, if at all possible.  I feel like I've seen comments to the effect that the zkpython tests are run automatically, but I'm not sure if that's actually true or not.
