zktreeutil - Zookeeper Tree Data Utility

==========================================

zktreeutil program is intended to manage and manipulate zk-tree data quickly, effi-
ciently and with ease. The utility operates on free-form ZK-tree and hence can be used
for any cluster managed by Zookeeper. Here are the basic functionalities -

EXPORT: The whole/partial ZK-tree is exported into a XML file. This helps in
capturing a current snapshot of the data for backup/analysis. For a subtree
export, one need to specify the path to the ZK-subtree with proper option.

IMPORT: The ZK-tree can be imported from XML into ZK cluster. This helps in priming
the new ZK cluster with static configuration. The import can be non-intrusive by
making only the additions in the existing data. The import of subtree is also
possible by optionally providing the path to the ZK-subtree.

DIFF: Creates a diff between live ZK data vs data saved in XML file. Diff can ignore
some ZK-tree branches (possibly dynamic data) on reading the optional ignore flag
from XML file. Diffing on a ZK-subtree achieved by providing path to ZK-subtree with
diff command.

UPDATE: Make the incremental changes into the live ZK-tree from saved XML, essentia-
lly after running the diff.

DUMP: Dumps the ZK-tree on the standard output device reading either from live ZK
server or XML file. Like export, ZK-subtree can be dumped with optionaly
providing the path to the ZK-subtree, and till a certain depth of the (sub)tree.

The exported ZK data into XML file can be shortened by only keeping the static ZK
nodes which are required to prime a cluster. The dynamic zk nodes (created on-the-
fly) can be ignored by setting a 'ignore' attribute at the root node of the dynamic
subtree (see tests/zk_sample.xml), possibly deleting all inner ZK nodes under that.
Once ignored, the whole subtree is ignored during DIFF, UPDATE and WRITE.
