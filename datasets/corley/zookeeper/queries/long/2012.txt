please see http://apache-hbase.679495.n3.nabble.com/HBase-client-hangs-after-client-side-OOM-td4062675.html.

it looks the send thread caught the error successfully, as it is finally running fine.. but the cleanup fail to notify the main thread...so I suspect it is a very small timing hole that the packet is not on the 2 queues at the same time..it looks it could happen in the latest code ClientCnxnSocketNIO#doIO as well..

potential fixes:
1)add timeout during wait
2)try/catch for the possible timing hole:

                  if (!p.bb.hasRemaining()) {
                        sentCount++;
                        outgoingQueue.removeFirstOccurrence(p);
                        if (p.requestHeader != null
                                && p.requestHeader.getType() != OpCode.ping
                                && p.requestHeader.getType() != OpCode.auth) {
                            synchronized (pendingQueue) {
                                pendingQueue.add(p);
                            }
                        }
                    }



thoughts?
thanks.
