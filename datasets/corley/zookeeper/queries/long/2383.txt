In attempting to upgrade Solr's ZooKeeper dependency from 3.4.6 to 3.4.8 (SOLR-8724) I ran into test failures where attempts to create a node in a newly started standalone ZooKeeperServer were failing because of an assertion in MBeanRegistry.

ZooKeeperServer.startup() first sets up its request processor chain then registers itself in JMX, but if a connection comes in before the server's JMX registration happens, registration of the connection will fail because it trips the assertion that (effectively) its parent (the server) has already registered itself.

ZooKeeperServer.java
    public synchronized void startup() {
        if (sessionTracker == null) {
            createSessionTracker();
        }
        startSessionTracker();
        setupRequestProcessors();

        registerJMX();

        state = State.RUNNING;
        notifyAll();
    }



MBeanRegistry.java
    public void register(ZKMBeanInfo bean, ZKMBeanInfo parent)
        throws JMException
    {
        assert bean != null;
        String path = null;
        if (parent != null) {
            path = mapBean2Path.get(parent);
            assert path != null;
        }



This problem appears to be new with ZK 3.4.8 - AFAIK Solr never had this issue with ZK 3.4.6.
