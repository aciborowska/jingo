Try to add new observer server using reconfig API, server gets added as participant.
STEPS:

	create 3 node cluster.

server.0=127.0.0.1:11223:11224:participant;127.0.0.1:11222
server.1=127.0.0.1:11226:11227:participant;127.0.0.1:11225
server.2=127.0.0.1:11229:11230:participant;127.0.0.1:11228


	Suppose the 2 is the leader in the above cluster. Configure the new server as

server.2=127.0.0.1:11229:11230:participant;127.0.0.1:11228
server.3=127.0.0.1:11232:11233:observer;127.0.0.1:11231


	Connect to 1 and execute the reconfig command

zkClient.reconfig("server.3=127.0.0.1:11232:11233:observer;127.0.0.1:11231", null, null, -1, null, null);


	Verify sever 3. It was supposed to run as observer but it is running as participant
