There should be a better connection between connect timeout, ping timeout, and session timeout. On the Java client it is sessionTimeout/hostsList.length. On the C client it's just the readTimeout. There is also an arbitrary delay when we find that all the hosts are down.

We should come up with a good consistent story for the connect timeout. Since we leave sessionTimeout/3 ms for recovery from a down server, it seems most reasonable to have something like sessionTimeout/(3*hostsList.length).
