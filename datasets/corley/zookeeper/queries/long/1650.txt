testServerCnxnExpiry is failing consistently on solaris apache jenkins:
https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/ZooKeeper/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-solaris/475/testReport/org.apache.zookeeper.test/ServerCnxnTest/testServerCnxnExpiry/

Seems to have started around the time the NIO multi-threading changes were introduced - but it's hard to say (some of the history has been lost already).

Possibly just a bad test or timeouts not long enough...
