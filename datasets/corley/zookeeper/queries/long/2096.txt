It reports:
warning C4005: 'EWOULDBLOCK' : macro redefinition
warning C4005: 'EINPROGRESS' : macro redefinition

In MSVS 2010+, these constants are now in <errno.h>.
What's worse, they have different numeric values.

Possible fix:
In "src/c/include/winconfig.h" :
#if _MSC_VER < 1600
#define EWOULDBLOCK WSAEWOULDBLOCK
#define EINPROGRESS WSAEINPROGRESS
#endif
