jute.maxbuffer can be configured in both client and server side, if we try to getChildren
from a parent znode with large number of children znode, client may failed to get because
of packetLen is more than jute.maxbuffer configured. 
even if we can change the value in java system property, but we have to restart the application,
and more all data has been in zookeeper client, check the length/size is unnecessary.
