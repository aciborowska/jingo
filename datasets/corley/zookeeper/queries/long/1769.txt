There seem to be a few bugs in the trunk that prevent ZooInspector to load the node viewers ( the 3 tabs in the main windows when you select a ZK node in the tree don't show up any more ).
Apparently it has been introduced 2 years ago after a refactoring about icons and another about partially fixing a typo ("veiwer" -> "viewer").

Note: the bug is only in trunk, 3.4 is fine.
