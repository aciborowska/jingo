I was testing stability of Zookeeper ensemble for production deployment. Three node ensemble cluster configuration.
In a loop, I kill/restart three Zookeeper clients that created one ephemeral node each, and at the same time,
I killed Java process on one of ensemble (dont' know if it was a leader or not). Then I restarted Zookeeper on the server,

It turns out that on two zookeeper ensemble servers, all the ephemeral nodes are gone (it should), but on the newly started
Zookeeper server, the two old ephemeral nodes stayed.  The zookeeper didn't restart in standalone mode since new ephemeral
nodes gets created on all ensemble servers. 
I captured the log.
