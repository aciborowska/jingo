As a user, I would like to be able to create a node that is NOT tied to a session but that WILL expire automatically if action is not taken by some client within a time window.

I propose this to enable clients interacting with ZK via http or other "thin clients" to create ephemeral-like nodes.

Some ideas for the design, up for discussion:

The node should support all normal ZK node operations including ACLs, sequential key generation, etc, however, it should not support the ephemeral flag. The node will be created with a TTL that is updated via a refresh operation. 

The ZK quorum will watch this node similarly to the way that it watches for session liveness; if the node is not refreshed within the TTL, it will expire.

QUESTIONS:

1) Should we let the refresh operation set the TTL to a different base value?
2) If so, should the setting of the TTL to a new base value cause a watch to fire?
3) Do we want to allow these nodes to have children or prevent this similar to ephemeral nodes?
