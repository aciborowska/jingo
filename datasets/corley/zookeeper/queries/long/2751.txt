In ZOOKEEPER-2743 we observed a race condition in Netty code path that could lead to connection bean leaking; similar code pattern exists in NIO code path as well, however existing unit tests never fail when NIO code path is activated. This is a follow up of ZOOKEEPER-2743 to ensure we don't have connection bean leak when NIO code path is used. 

Deliverable:

	Unit tests that fail with connection bean when NIO code path is enabled.
Or
	Proof / analysis that NIO code path does not leak cnx bean and why.
