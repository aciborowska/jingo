I'm seeing the following intermittent failure:


junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Should have called my watcher expected:<1> but was:<0>
	at org.apache.zookeeper.test.AuthTest.testBadAuthThenSendOtherCommands(AuthTest.java:89)
	at org.apache.zookeeper.JUnit4ZKTestRunner$LoggedInvokeMethod.evaluate(JUnit4ZKTestRunner.java:52)



The following commit introduced this test:

ZOOKEEPER-1152. Exceptions thrown from handleAuthentication can cause buffer corruption issues in NIOServer. (camille via breed)

+            Assert.assertEquals("Should have called my watcher",
+                    1, authFailed.get());

I think it's due to either a) the code is not waiting for the
notification to be propagated, or 2) the message doesn't make it back
from the server to the client prior to the socket or the clientcnxn
being closed.

What do you think, should I just wait for the notification to arrive? or do you think it's 2). ?
