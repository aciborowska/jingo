znodes have max 1mb of data storage. using zk to store large amounts of data can negatively impact latency as seen by clients - the server needs to serve the data. often it's a better idea to store a "token" (say a uri) in the znode pointing to a large data block stored elsewhere (filesystem? memcached, etc...) this offloads zk and reduces latency impact

we should have details of this in the forrest docs.
