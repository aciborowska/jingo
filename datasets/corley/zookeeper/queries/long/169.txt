We need the content which describes how to a client should connect to a zookeeper server. Ideally this would have pseudo code describing any lead-up (for example resource allocation, etc),  a few lines of sample code in Java, and a few parallel lines in C. 

Any commentary would be highly appreciated. Stuff like, "You can open an unlimited number of ZooKeeper connections because..." or "Opening too many connections to ZooKeeper is not advisable because..." â€“ in short, anything that is not obvious to the new ZooKeeper developer.
