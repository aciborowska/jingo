running  ant tar  gives following error

D:\gitHome\zookeeper-trunk\build.xml:1432: Execute failed: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "autoreconf" (in directory "D:\gitHome\zookeeper-trunk\src\c"):


This error is purely environment error and it can be fixed by installing appropriate software package. 
But does it really required to configure the cpp unit as  ant tar target flow does not run cppunit test cases. Then why to configure?
There should be no cppunit configurations for  ant tar target flow.
