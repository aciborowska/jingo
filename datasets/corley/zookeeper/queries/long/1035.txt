We were trying to use the predefined ACL "Ids.CREATOR_ALL_ACL" together with the default ip authentication. Unfortunately it seems that this cannot work due to the implementation of the PrepRequestProcessor.fixupACL() method checking the return value of the AuthenticationProvider.isAuthenticated() (the IPAuthenticationProvider in our case) method. 
Unfortunately this provider always returns false which results in the Ids.CREATOR_ALL_ACL to be always rejected.
