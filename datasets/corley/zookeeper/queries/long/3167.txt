1. In production environment, there will be always a situation that there are a lot of recursive sub nodes of one node. We need to count total number of it.

2. Now, we can only use API getChildren  which returns the List<String> of first level of sub nodes. We need to iterate every sub node to get recursive sub nodes. It will cost a lot of time.

3.  In zookeeper server side, it uses Hasp<String, DataNode> to store node.  The key of the map represents the path of the node. We can iterate the map get total number of all levels of sub nodes of one node.
