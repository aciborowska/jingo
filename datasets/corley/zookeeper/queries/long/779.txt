In some scenario, whether the client can connect to zookeeper servers is used as a logic condition. If the client cannot connect to the servers, the program should turn to another fork. However, current zookeeper_init could not tell whether the client can connect to one server or not. It could make some users feel confused. I think we should check the connectivity to the host in zookeeper_init, so we can tell whether the hosts are avaiable at that time or not.
