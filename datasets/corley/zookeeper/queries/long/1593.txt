In our configuration we use a different data directory for Zookeeper. The problem is that the current Debian init.d script has the default location hardcoded:

ZOOPIDDIR=/var/lib/zookeeper/data
ZOOPIDFILE=${ZOOPIDDIR}/zookeeper_server.pid

By using the standard Debian practice of allowing for a /etc/default/zookeeper we can redefine these variables to point to the correct location:

ZOOPIDDIR=/var/lib/zookeeper/data
ZOOPIDFILE=${ZOOPIDDIR}/zookeeper_server.pid

[ -r /etc/default/zookeeper ] && . /etc/default/zookeeper

This currently can't be done through /usr/libexec/zkEnv.sh, since that is loaded before ZOOPIDDIR and ZOOPIDFILE are set. Any change there would therefore undo the setup made in for example /etc/zookeeper/zookeeper-env.sh.
