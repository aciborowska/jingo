When use zk in distributional model,we need to touch a myid file in dataDir.then write a unique number to it.It is inconvenient and not user-friendly,Look at an example from other distribution system such as kafka:it just uses broker.id=0 in the server.properties to indentify a unique server node.This issue is going to abandon the myid file and use a new property such as server.id=0 in the zoo.cfg. this fix will be applied to master branch,branch-3.5+,
keep branch-3.4 unchaged.
