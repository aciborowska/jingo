I know this is long but please here me out.

I recently inherited a massive zookeeper ensemble.  The snapshot is 3.4 GB on disk.  Because of its massive size we have been running into a number of issues. There are lots of problems that we hope to fix with tuning GC etc, but the big one right now that is blocking us making a lot of progress on the rest of them is that when we lose a quorum because the leader left, for what ever reason, it can take well over 5 mins for a new quorum to be established.  So we cannot tune the leader without risking downtime.

We traced down where the time was being spent and found that each server was clearing the database so it would be read back in again before leader election even started.  Then as part of the sync phase each server will write out a snapshot to checkpoint the progress it made as part of the sync.

I will be putting up a patch shortly with some proposed changes in it.
