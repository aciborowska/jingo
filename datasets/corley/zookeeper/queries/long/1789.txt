(assigning to Alex because this was introduced by ZOOKEEPER-107, but will upload a patch as well.)

I have a 5 participants cluster running what will be 3.5.0 (i.e.: trunk as of today) and an observer running 3.4 (trunk from 3.4 branch). When the observer tries to establish a connection to the participants I get:


Thread Thread[10.40.78.121:3888,5,main] died java.lang.NullPointerException at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManager.receiveConnection(QuorumCnxManager.java:240)
        at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManager$Listener.run(QuorumCnxManager.java:552)



Looking at QuorumCnxManager.java:240:


            if (protocolVersion >= 0) { // this is a server id and not a protocol version                                                             
               sid = protocolVersion;
                electionAddr = self.getVotingView().get(sid).electionAddr;
            } else {



and self.getVotingView().get(sid) will be null for Observers.  So this block should cover that case.
