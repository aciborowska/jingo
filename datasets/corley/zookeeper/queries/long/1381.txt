Zookeeper client API is designed to be server version agnostic as much as possible, so we can have new clients with old servers (or the opposite). But there is today no simple way for a client to know what's the server version. This would be very useful in order to;

	check the compatibility (ex: 'multi' implementation available since 3.4 while 3.4 clients API supports 3.3 servers as well)
	have different implementation depending on the server functionalities



A workaround (proposed by Mahadev Konar) is do "echo stat | nc hostname clientport" and parse the output to get the version. The output is, for example:
-----------------------
Zookeeper version: 3.4.2--1, built on 01/30/2012 17:43 GMT
