Many apache projects including Hadoop register with nabble to host
online forums & great online archives of the mailing lists...

Currently there's hadoop-core, hbase and lucene on there.

I often refer to mailing list posts by nabble link; they're really
handy. Plus end users often prefer the forum style nabble approach to
getting every single email sent to a mailing list.

Does a committer on zookeeper fancy registering the ZK mailing lists
too (as a child of the Hadoop list)? I'd do it myself but then I'd be
the owner of the forum which doesn't feel right - a committer should
probably do it.

Its a pretty quick process, click here

and fill out the details. The hardest part is knowing the mailing list
software which AFAIK is ezmlm
