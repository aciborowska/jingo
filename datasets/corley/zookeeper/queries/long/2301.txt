QuorumPeer does not listen on passed client IP in the constructor, for client  connection. It always listens on all IP(0.0.0.0 or 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0). This happens only when QuorumPeer is created using any of the bellow constructors

org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeer.QuorumPeer(Map<Long,QuorumServer> quorumPeers, File snapDir,
            File logDir, int clientPort, int electionAlg,
            long myid, int tickTime, int initLimit, int syncLimit)



org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeer.QuorumPeer(Map<Long,QuorumServer> quorumPeers, File snapDir,
            File logDir, int clientPort, int electionAlg,
            long myid, int tickTime, int initLimit, int syncLimit,
            QuorumVerifier quorumConfig)
