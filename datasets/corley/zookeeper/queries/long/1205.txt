Create a unit test to test Kerberos ticket renewal.

Note that testing Kerberos-related functionality in Java requires that a default kerberos configuration file be available. The location of this file can be set with the java.security.krb5.conf property (see http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/jgss/tutorials/KerberosReq.html ). For more background on Java and Kerberos, see http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5.0/docs/guide/security/jgss/single-signon.html . For discussion about TGT renewal, see http://freeipa.org/page/Automatic_Ticket_Renewal .
