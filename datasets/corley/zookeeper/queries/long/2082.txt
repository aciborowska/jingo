The parameter, electionAlgo, is supposed to be 0--3. However, when I mistyped the value in my zoo.cfg (I'm stupid), ZK falls into a dead loop and starts filling up the entire disk which millions of the follow 2 lines...

java.lang.NullPointerException
    at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeer.run(QuorumPeer.java:762)

The error rooted in createElectionAlgorithm() where an invalid setting leads to null for the Election object. Then, in the while look in run(), it causes null-pointer de-referencing which is captured but is not handled well.

I think our should check the setting of electionAlg in the very beginning to make sure it's a valid setting, instead of using it at runtime and cause the unfortunate things.

Let me know if you wanna a patch. I'd like to check it in the parseProperties() function in QuorumPeerConfig.java.

Thanks!
