In the ZK 3.4.3 release's version of zkCli.sh, the last command that was executed is re-executed when you ctrl+d out of the shell. In the snippet below, ls is executed, and then ctrl+d is triggered (inserted below to illustrate), the output from ls appears again, due to the command being re-run. 

[zk: zookeeper.example.com:2181(CONNECTED) 0] ls /blah
[foo]
[zk: zookeeper.example.com:2181(CONNECTED) 1] <ctrl+d> [foo]
$
