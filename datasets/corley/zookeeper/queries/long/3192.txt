In the zoo_amulti function (zookeeper.c) , it seems an initialization problem.


struct RequestHeader h = { STRUCT_INITIALIZER(xid, get_xid()), STRUCT_INITIALIZER(type, ZOO_MULTI_OP) };
struct MultiHeader mh = { STRUCT_INITIALIZER(type, -1), STRUCT_INITIALIZER(done, 1), STRUCT_INITIALIZER(err, -1) };
struct oarchive *oa = create_buffer_oarchive();
completion_head_t clist = { 0 };


variable "clist" 's member cond and lock are not initialized correctly. They should be initialized by pthread_cond_init and pthread_mutex_init. Otherwise zoo_amulti would crash when queue_completion was called witch calls pthread_cond_boardcast using clist->cond
