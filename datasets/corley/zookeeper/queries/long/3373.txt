In website, "Single System Image" is "A client will see the same view of the service regardless of the server that it connects to."

I want to change it to "Once connected, a client will see the same view of the service even if it switchs to another server"

Because the old one is a little misleading, if cluster has a outdated follower and a normal follower, I not think a client will see the same view of the service regardless of the server that it connects to at its first connection.
