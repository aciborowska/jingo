Currently we are statically linking c unit tests to ZK client library - we should use shared library instead as there seems no particular reason to stick to static library, plus one benefit of using shared library is that would allow us to use overrides function calls from standard libraries at link time so we can simulate the wrap option for ld linker on os x.
