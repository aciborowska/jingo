I put the log4j.properties into the conf folder, plus a symlink to the base zookeeper folder, as described in the documentation.
Neither of them seem to be picked up, as my rolling logger is not recognized (no logs created), and also bin/zkServer.sh print-cmd shows wrong logger configuration. Is that a problem of the start script or did I put the properties file into the wrong place?

Note however, that also my additional java command-line options (from JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS) don't get picked up by the start script, as can be seen by ps aux | grep java (e.g. -Xmx1000m instead of -Xmx500 as I defined it).
The script's refer to a lot of environment variables that aren't explained in the documentation and nowhere defined; I can't get it to run.
