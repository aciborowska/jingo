The windows C MultiThreaded client crashes when usng the zoo_multi APis.  The underlying is that the mutex and condition variables need to be initialized with pthread_cond_init and pthread_mutex_init.

Attached are the files I've modified to make this work.  In the modified files I've added a "multi" command to cli that when Cli.exe (mt build) is run on window's without the rest of the fixes will crash.
