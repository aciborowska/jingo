In the socket connection logic there are several errors that result in bad behavior.  The basic problem is that a socket is registered with a selector unconditionally when there are nuances that should be dealt with.  First, the socket may connect immediately.  Secondly, the connect may throw an exception.  In either of these two cases, I don't think that the socket should be registered.

I will attach a test case that demonstrates the problem.  I have been unable to create a unit test that exhibits the problem because I would have to mock the low level socket libraries to do so.  It would still be good to do so if somebody can figure out a good way.
