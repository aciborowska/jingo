I'm using Zookeeper 3.4.6

The ZK log data folder keeps growing with transaction logs files (log.*).

I set the following in zoo.cfg:
autopurge.purgeInterval=1
autopurge.snapRetainCount=3
dataDir=..data

Per ZK log, it reads those parameters:

2017-07-13 10:36:21,266 [myid:] - INFO  [main:DatadirCleanupManager@78] - autopurge.snapRetainCount set to 3
2017-07-13 10:36:21,266 [myid:] - INFO  [main:DatadirCleanupManager@79] - autopurge.purgeInterval set to 1

It also says that cleanup process is running:

2017-07-13 10:36:21,266 [myid:] - INFO  [PurgeTask:DatadirCleanupManager$PurgeTask@138] - Purge task started.
2017-07-13 10:36:21,297 [myid:] - INFO  [PurgeTask:DatadirCleanupManager$PurgeTask@144] - Purge task completed.

But actually nothing is deleted.
Every service restart, a new file is created.

The only parameter I managed to change is preAllocSize, which means the minimum size per file. The default is 64MB. I changed it to 10KB only for testing, and I swa the effect as expected: new files were created with 10KB.

I also tried to create a batch file that will run the following:

java -cp zookeeper-3.4.6.jar;lib/slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar;lib/slf4j-log4j12-1.6.1.jar;lib/log4j-1.2.16.jar;conf org.apache.zookeeper.server.PurgeTxnLog .\data -n 3

But it still doesn't do the job.

Please advise.
