Hello,

i would like to see slf4j integrated into the zookeeper instead of relying explicitly on log4j.

slf4j is an abstract logging framework. There are adapters from slf4j to many logger implementations, one of them is log4j.

The decision which log engine to use i dont like to make so early.

This would help me to embed zookeeper in my own applications (which use a different logger implemenation, but slf4j is the basis)

What do you think?

(as i can see, those slf4j request flood all other projects on apache as well 

Maybe for 3.4 or 4.0?

I can offer a patchset, i have experience in such an migration already.
