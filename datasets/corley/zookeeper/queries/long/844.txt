ClientCnxn.java currently has the following code:
  if (replyHdr.getXid() == -4) {
                // -2 is the xid for AuthPacket
                // TODO: process AuthPacket here
                if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) 
{
                    LOG.debug("Got auth sessionid:0x"
                            + Long.toHexString(sessionId));
                }
                return;
            }

Auth failures appear to cause the server to disconnect but the client never gets a proper state change or notification that auth has failed, which makes handling this scenario very difficult as it causes the client to go into a loop of sending bad auth, getting disconnected, trying to reconnect, sending bad auth again, over and over.
