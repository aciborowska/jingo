the followng code failed on hudson
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/view/ZooKeeper/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/371/

      watchctx_t ctx1, ctx2;
      zhandle_t *zk1 = createClient(&ctx1);
      CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL(true, ctx1.waitForConnected(zk1));
      zhandle_t *zk2 = createClient(&ctx2);
      zookeeper_close(zk1);
      CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL(true, ctx2.waitForConnected(zk2));

there's a problem with this test, it assumes that close(1) can be called before createclient(2) gets connected.

this is not correct: createclient is an async call an in some cases the connection can be established before
create client returns.

this shows a failure in this case because client1 was created, then client2 attempted to connect
but failed due to this on the server (max conn exceeded):
        sprintf(cmd, "export ZKMAXCNXNS=1;%s startClean %s", ZKSERVER_CMD, getHostPorts());

conn 2 failed and therefore the following assert eventually failed.

this code should not assume that close(1) will beat connect(2)


Henry can you take a look?
