In branch-3.5 release auditing generating warnings against cert files as these files don't contain Apache License (AL) header. I don't think these files should be checked because they are not source files, and we skip them in master branch. We should do the same for branch-3.5 by skipping these cert files as well. This should be fixed before 3.5.3 release.

Attach the snippet of warning for reference:
