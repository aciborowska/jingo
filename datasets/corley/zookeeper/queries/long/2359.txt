ClientCnxn.java logs errors during watcher removal:

LOG.error("Failed to find watcher!", nwe);
LOG.error("Exception when removing watcher", ke);

An error code/exception is generated so the logs are noisy and unnecessary. If the client handles the error there's still a log message. This is different than other APIs. These logs should be removed.
