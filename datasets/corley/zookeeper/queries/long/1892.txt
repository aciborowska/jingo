zookeeper_interest() already calls zoo_cycle_next_server() when the socket is set to -1, so we shouldn't call addrvec_next in handle_error. This causes the next server to get skipped. Zookeeper_simpleSystem::testFirstServerDown fails unless the client gets connected to the server during the first round because the client keeps skipping the second server after the first round.
