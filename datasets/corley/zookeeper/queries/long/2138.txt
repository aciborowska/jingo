After testHammer has been fixed, now test-core-java is successful and test-core-cppunit emerges to fail:

https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/ZooKeeper/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2624/console
https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/ZooKeeper/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-Build/2557/console

I have try git bitsect under "src/c" and figure out the JIRA causing problem:


	ZOOKEEPER-2114 (might be some other jira between ZK-2114 and ZK-2049)
My local jenkins showed the error messages:

 [exec] /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/zk-trunk/src/c/tests/TestClient.cc:1072: Assertion: assertion failed [Expression: ctx.waitForConnected(zk)]
