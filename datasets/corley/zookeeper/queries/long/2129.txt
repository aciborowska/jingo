ruok commands prints the output in the same line unlike the other four letter commands which print output in next line. Even though output is correct it is difficult to notice the output specially for a first time user. Its output should contain new line character as other four letter command's output 

ruok command output:

HOST1:/home # echo ruok | netcat 10.x.x.x 2181
imokHOST1:/home #



conf Command output:

HOST1:/home # echo conf | netcat 10.x.x.x 2181
