Unlike current ZooKeeper version in trunk intended for release as 3.5.0, the current ZooKeeper server version 3.4.5 binds to all ip addresses on the specified port for election. It only makes sense to bind to the ip address indicated in the configuration file, which is where the other servers will connect. Listening to other ip addresses could have bad security implications.
