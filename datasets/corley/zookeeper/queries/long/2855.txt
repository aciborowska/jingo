We are testing our distributed system model checking (DMCK)
 by directing our DMCK to reproduce the ZooKepeer-2172 bug in the ZooKeeper v3.5.3.

After some exploration, our DMCK found that the ZOOKEEPER-2172 still linger in the reported fixed version, ZooKeeper v.3.5.3.

Here we attached the complete bug scenario to reproduce the bug.
 We have communicated this bug to Alexander Shraer and he has confirmed that this bug exists.
