Background
ZOOKEEPER-1107 introduced a DatadirCleanupManager to automatically purge snapshots. This can be configured using autopurge.snapRetainCount and autopurge.purgeInterval. This is documented here and there.
Symptoms
Autopurging does not work when running a standalone ZooKeeperServer. The DatadirCleanupManager is started by the QuorumPeerMain, but there is no similar setup ZooKeeperServerMain. ServerConfig does not hold autopurge properties.
Expected Behavior
Starting a standalone zookeeper server should enable autopurging with the same behavior as a quorum server.
