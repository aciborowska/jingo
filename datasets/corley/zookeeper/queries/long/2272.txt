	Following code in org.apache.zookeeper.server.ZooKeeperServer should be cleaned up. Some how it got missed in code review

if ((System.getProperty("zookeeper.allowSaslFailedClients") != null)
  &&  (System.getProperty("zookeeper.allowSaslFailedClients").equals("true"))) {


should be replaced with 

if(Boolean.getBoolean("zookeeper.allowSaslFailedClients"))


	Similar code clean up can be done in org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.KerberosName
