In a WAN configuration, ZooKeeper is endlessly electing, terminating, and re-electing a ZooKeeper leader. The WAN configuration involves two groups, a central DC group of ZK servers that have a voting weight = 1, and a group of servers in remote pods with a voting weight of 0.

What we expect to see is leaders elected only in the DC, and the pods to contain only followers. What we are seeing is a continuous cycling of leaders. We have seen this consistently with 3.2.0, 3.2.0 + recommended patches (473, 479, 481, 491), and now release 3.2.1.
