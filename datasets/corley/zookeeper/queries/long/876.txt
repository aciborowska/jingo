When starting a new leadership, unnecessary snapshot transfers happen between new leader and followers. This is so because of multiple small bugs. 

1) the comparison of zxids is done based on a new proposal, instead of the last logged zxid. (LearnerHandler.java ~ 297)
2) if follower is one zxid behind, the check of the interval of committed logs excludes the follower. (LearnerHandler.java ~ 277)
3) the bug reported in ZOOKEEPER-874 (commitLogs are empty after recover).
