This issue can be reproduced by creating a node with a new ACL during data tree serialization after ACL cache serialization. When restoring from this snapshot without the tranlog, the state will include a node with no corresponding ACL in the ACL cache. This node will then be impossible to operate on as it will cause a MarshallingError.

If the tranlog is played over a server in this erroneous state, it does appear to correct itself. This bug means that to reliably restore from a snapshot, you must also have backed up the subsequent tranlog covering at least the transactions that were partially written to the snapshot.

It also appears possible for a snapshot to be missing a session yet contain an ephemeral node created by that session; fortunately ZooKeeperServer.loadData() should clean these ephemerals up.
