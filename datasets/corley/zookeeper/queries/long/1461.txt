prepend_string, called before any checks for NULL in the c client for many API functions, has this line (zookeeper 3.3.5):

    if (zh->chroot == NULL)

That means that before you check for NULL, you are dereferencing the pointer. This bug does not exist in the 3.4.* branch for whatever reason, but it still remains in the 3.3.* line. A patch which fixes it would make the line as follows:

    if (zh == NULL || zh->chroot == NULL)

I would do that for you, but I don't know how to patch the 3.3.5 branch.
