I see in http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/ that we have http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/, but http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/api/ is a 404. I can generate the docs locally, but it would be useful to be able to be able to have URLs to reference the trunk API (e.g. for discussing new features in the JIRA).
