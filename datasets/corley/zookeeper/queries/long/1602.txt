The following patch broke an API that's in use by HBase. Otherwise current trunk compiles fine when used by hbase:

ZOOKEEPER-1411. Consolidate membership management, distinguish between static and dynamic configuration parameters (Alex Shraer via breed)

Considering it a blocker even though it's not really a "public" API. If possible we should add back "getServers" method on QuorumPeerConfig to reduce friction for the hbase team.
