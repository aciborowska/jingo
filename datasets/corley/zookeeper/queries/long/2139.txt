I have two ZK client in one JVM, one is secure client and second is normal client (For non secure cluster).

"zookeeper.sasl.client" system property is "true" by default, because of this my second client connection is failing.

We should pass all client configurations in client constructor like HDFS client.

For example :

public ZooKeeper(String connectString, int sessionTimeout, Watcher watcher, Configuration conf) throws IOException
	{
		......
		......
	}
