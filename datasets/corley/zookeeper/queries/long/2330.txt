When kerberos is used as authentication mechanism, one login thread runs in the background for ZooKeeper client as well ZooKeepr server.
This problem is related to Zookeeper client and the scenario is as follows:


	Main application connects to Zookeeper

ZooKeeper zooKeeper = new ZooKeeper(zookeeperConnectionString, sessionTimeout, this)


	Completes it is work with zookeeper
	calls close() on zookeeper, and continues with rest of the application specific work



Thread dump, taken after 3rd step, shows that login thread is still alive

"Thread-1" daemon prio=6 tid=0x04842c00 nid=0x1f04 waiting on condition [0x05b7f000]
