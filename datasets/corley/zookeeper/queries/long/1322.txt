While triaging ZOOKEEPER-1319 I updated the code with the attached patch in order to help debug what was going on with that issue. I think it would be useful to include these changes in the project itself. ff to include in 3.4.1 or push to 3.5.0.

You should verify this with TRACE logging turned on in addition to INFO (default).
