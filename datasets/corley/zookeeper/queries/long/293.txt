ZOOKEEPER-255 fixed an issue with zoo_set not providing access to stat structure, however this has broken b/w compatibility with previous releases.

We need to:

1) revert zoo_set to not have stat parameter (keep b/w compat)
2) add zoo_set2 method with stat param added to the function signature
3) add a version.h file to src/c/include that provides zoo version detail to clients

ie.
> #define ZOO_MAJOR_VERSION 3
> #define ZOO_MINOR_VERSION 1
> #define ZOO_PATCH_VERSION 0

(a new jira should be added to centralize version numbering, we now have the version number in 3 places in the source)
