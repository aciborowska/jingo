It would be nice to have an ability to do probabilistic tracing similar to Cassandra  nodetool

This will help debug issues in prod systems.

I'd like to contribute if everyone is ok with the feature.

My suggestion is to add an extra parameter to ZooTrace to handle it. Questions:

	should it be one global param or per each ZooTrace mask? I'm thinking per mask
	should it be a new 4lw or part of 'stmk'? Leaning towards new word and refactoring param passing to words (stmk is a special case right now).
	there are places in the code that use LOG.trace directly. That will have to change to ZooTrace



I can make some initial implementation for demo/review.
