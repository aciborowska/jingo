Zookeeper is used in applications where fault tolerance is important. Its client i/o thread send/recv heartbeats to/fro Zookeeper ensemble to stay connected. However healthy heartbeat does not always means that the application that uses Zookeeper client is in good health, it only means that ZK client thread is in good health.

This I needed something that can tagged onto Zookeeper ping that represents L7 (application) health as well.
I have modified C client source to support this in minimal way. I am new to Zookeeper, so please code review this code.  I am actually using this code in our in-house solution.
