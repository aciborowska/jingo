We recently upgraded zookeeper from 3.2.1 to 3.3.1, now we are seeing less client deadlock on session expiration, which is a definite plus!

Unfortunately we are seeing memory leak that requires our zk clients to be restarted every half-day. Valgrind result:

==8804== 25 (12 direct, 13 indirect) bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 255 of 670
