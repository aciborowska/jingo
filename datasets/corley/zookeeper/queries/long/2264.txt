	Wrong error message when secureClientPortAddress is configured but secureClientPort is not configured.
zookeeper throws IllegalArgumentException with error message clientPortAddress is set but clientPort is not set but should be secureClientPortAddress is set but secureClientPort is not set
	There is another problem with the same code.
value is assigned to local variable but null check is done on instance variable so we will never get error message for this scenario.

if (this.secureClientPortAddress != null) {

should be replaced with 

if (secureClientPortAddress != null) {

	Above problem is there for clientPort scenario also. So we should replace

if (this.clientPortAddress != null) {

with 

if (clientPortAddress != null) {
