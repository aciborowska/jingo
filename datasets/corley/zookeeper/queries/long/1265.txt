As discussed on the list, it's probably an error that the ReadOnlyRequestProcessor does not have multi alongside the other write operations.
Adding check to the lists may not make a difference by now since the ZK client does not expose check as a first level request but only encapsulated inside a multi request. However from a logical view, change belongs in these lists.
