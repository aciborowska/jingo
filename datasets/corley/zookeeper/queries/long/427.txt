I am running a 5 node ZooKeeper cluster and I noticed that one of them has very high CPU usage:

 PID   USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S   %CPU %MEM    TIME+   COMMAND 
 6883  infact       22   0   725m  41m  4188 S   95       0.5          5671:54  java

It is not "doing anything" application-wise at this point, so I was wondering why the heck it's using up so much CPU.
