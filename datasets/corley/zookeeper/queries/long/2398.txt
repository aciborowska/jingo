Some config options (such as enabling readonly mode) are only settable via a system property.  This feels clunky, and makes it less seamless for testing, or for apps which embed a ZooKeeper inside a java container, etc.

I ran into this issue specifically in the case of creating unit tests to test read-only mode client side behavior.  In this case, I want to run multiple QuorumPeer's in the same jvm, and have some of them enabled for read-only and some not enabled.  This is not possible with the current System.setProperty approach.

In general, I question the need for using system properties for configuration, since it makes embedding a server within a dependency injection framework more difficult, and is in general less easy to integrate into generic deployment systems.
