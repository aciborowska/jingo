When loading the snapshot, ZooKeeper will consider only the 'snapshots with atleast 10 bytes size'. Otherwsie it will ignore and just return without closing the RandomAccessFile.


Util.isValidSnapshot() having the following logic. 
       // Check for a valid snapshot
        RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(f, "r");
        // including the header and the last / bytes
        // the snapshot should be atleast 10 bytes
        if (raf.length() < 10) {
            return false;
        }



Since the snapshot file validation logic is outside try block, it won't go to the finally block and will be leaked.

Suggestion: Move the validation logic to the try/catch block.
