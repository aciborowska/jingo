In the file org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.FastLeaderElection.java for methods like totalOrderPredicate and termPredicate, which return boolean, the code is as below :

if (condition)
      return true;
else
      return false;

I feel, it would be better if the condition itself is returned.
i.e., return condition.

The same thing holds good else where if applicable.
