Currently, Zookeeper relies on zkEnv.sh logic to discover the location of the configuration directory if none is specified:


# We use ZOOCFGDIR if defined,
# otherwise we use /etc/zookeeper
# or the conf directory that is
# a sibling of this script's directory
if [ "x$ZOOCFGDIR" = "x" ]
then
    if [ -d "/etc/zookeeper" ]
    then
        ZOOCFGDIR="/etc/zookeeper"
    else
        ZOOCFGDIR="$ZOOBINDIR/../conf"
    fi
fi



The problem with such an approach is that having /etc/zookeeper (for whatever reason) trips this logic up in believing that
it is THE place. It would be much nicer to follow the suit of other Apache Hadoop projects and restrict the logic to
$ZOOCFGDIR and $ZOOBINDIR/../conf

Please note, that if that happens one can always have an existing behavior of picking up /etc/zookeeper by creating
a symlink at $ZOOBINDIR/../conf pointing to it.
