In zoo.cfg i have configured as
server.1 = XX.XX.XX.XX:65175:65173
server.2 = XX.XX.XX.XX:65185:65183
server.3 = XX.XX.XX.XX:65195:65193
server.4 = XX.XX.XX.XX:65205:65203:observer
server.5 = XX.XX.XX.XX:65215:65213:observer
server.6 = XX.XX.XX.XX:65225:65223:observer

Like above I have configured 3 PARTICIPANTS and 3 OBSERVERS
in the cluster of 6 zookeepers

Steps to reproduce the defect
1. Start all the 3 participant zookeeper
2. Stop all the participant zookeeper
3. Start zookeeper 1(Participant)
4. Start zookeeper 2(Participant)
5. Start zookeeper 4(Observer)
6. Create a persistent node with external client and close it
7. Stop the zookeeper 1(Participant neo quorum is unstable)
8. Create a new client and try to find the node created b4 using exists api (will fail since quorum not statisfied)
9. Start the Zookeeper 1 (Participant stabilise the quorum)

Now check the observer using 4 letter word (Server.4)
linux-216:/home/amith/CI/source/install/zookeeper/zookeeper2/bin # echo stat | netcat localhost 65200
Zookeeper version: 3.3.2-1031432, built on 11/05/2010 05:32 GMT

check the participant 2 with 4 letter word

linux-216:/home/amith/CI/source/install/zookeeper/zookeeper2/bin #

check the participant 1 with 4 letter word

linux-216:/home/amith/CI/source/install/zookeeper/zookeeper2/bin # echo stat | netcat localhost 65170
This ZooKeeper instance is not currently serving requests

We can see the participant1 logs filled with
2011-11-08 15:49:51,360 - WARN  [NIOServerCxn.Factory:0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:65170:NIOServerCnxn@642] - Exception causing close of session 0x0 due to java.io.IOException: ZooKeeperServer not running


Problem here is participent1 is not responding / accepting any requests
