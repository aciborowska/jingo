I read the ZooKeeper source code, and I find the purge task use FileTxnSnapLog#findNRecentSnapshots to find snapshots, but the method does not check whether the snapshots are valid.

Consider a worse case, a ZooKeeper server may have many invalid snapshots, and when a purge task begins, it will use the zxid in the last snapshot's name to purge old snapshots and transaction logs, then we may lost data. 

I think we should use FileSnap#findNValidSnapshots(int) instead of FileSnap#findNRecentSnapshots in FileTxnSnapLog#findNRecentSnapshots, but I am not sure.
