Currently we have this on C unit test output:

ZooKeeper server startedRunning
......
OK



This is because the zkServer.sh, when eco 'ZooKeeper server started', does not put a line break at the end. It will be clearer for readers of the console output if we fix this by adding a line break in between, so we can separate the script output and the test output. After the fix the output would look like:


ZooKeeper server started
Running
.....
OK
