The Eclipse test runner tries to run tests from all classes that inherit from TestCase. However, this class is inherited by at least one class (org.apache.zookeeper.test.system.BaseSysTest) that has no test cases as it is used as infrastructure for other real test cases. This patch annotates that class with @Ignore, which causes the class to be Ignored. Also, due to the way annotations are not inherited by default, this patch will not affect classes that inherit from this class.
