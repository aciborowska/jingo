I have been thinking this for a while and find that the zookeeper server code needs some cleaning up. The server code is a little tricky/confusing to read sometimes gievn that there is no clearity on ownership of objects. I will put down a proposal for restructuring/cleaning the code up with javadocs so that the code is easier to understand and develop on. comments on what you find confusing are welcome on this jira.
