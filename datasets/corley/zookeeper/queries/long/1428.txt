See discussion entitled 'ZOOKEEPER-1059 Was: Does the rolling-restart.sh script work?' on zookeerper-dev

HBase bin/rolling-restart.sh depends on zkcli returning non-zero exit code for non-existing znode.
Jonathan Hsieh found that rolling-restart.sh no longer works using zookeeper 3.4.x

From Patrick Hunt:

I think what we need is to have a tool that's intended for use both
programmatically and by humans, with more strict requirements about
input, output formatting and command handling, etc... Please see the
work Hartmut has been doing as part of 271 on trunk (3.5.0). Perhaps
we can augment these new classes to also support such a tool. However
it should instead be a true command line tool, rather than a shell.
