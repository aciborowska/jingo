After the directory structures has been created, it is time to create the pom files for all the modules, and create the build hierarchy. 
At first, ant should remain in place until we are sure maven works fine. 

jute and server should be priority first. docs is handled in a different jira, as it is also being migrated. Recipes and contrib will remain for last. 

The different modules will get their maven structure: 

 
zookeeper-[something] 
| -src 
| | -main 
| | | -java 
| | | \org... 
| | \resources 
| | -test (unit tests only) 
| | | -java 
| | | \org... 
| | \ resources 
| | - it (integration tests) 
| \pom.xml
