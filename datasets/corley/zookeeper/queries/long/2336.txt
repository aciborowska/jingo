Jenkins seems not working since Build #2976 (Dec 6, 2015) due to SVN.
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-Build/2976/console

     [exec] svn: E155036: Please see the 'svn upgrade' command
     [exec] svn: E155036: The working copy at '/home/jenkins/jenkins-slave/workspace/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-Build/trunk'
     [exec] is too old (format 10) to work with client version '1.8.8 (r1568071)' (expects format 31). You need to upgrade the working copy first.
