We are configuring Zookeeper with log4j to create a tracelog file separated from the zookeeper.log.

We have test using the following java properties:

call %JAVA% "-DrequestTraceFile" "-Dzookeeper.log.dir=%ZOO_LOG_DIR%" "-Dzookeeper.root.logger=%ZOO_LOG4J_PROP%" -cp "%CLASSPATH%" %ZOOMAIN% "%ZOOCFG%" %*


Is there a way to set this in a separate file?
If not, can this be included in the zookeeper.log content?

Please let us know if there is a way.
