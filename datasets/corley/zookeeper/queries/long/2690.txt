In ZOOKEEPER-2574, the documentation change (https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/111/) was done directly on the generated document files instead of on the document source. This JIRA is created to track the work of porting the doc change on the doc source so the change of the doc will not get lost between releases.
