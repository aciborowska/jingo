I was trying to see if ZK can be configured to always do client authentication (globally and not per znode). I came across this https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/Client-Server+mutual+authentication and it describes a config key requireClientAuthScheme that when set to 'sasl' should do the job. But upon looking at code (in master and in branch-3.5), I don't see any reference to it.
Raising this jira to update the wiki (assuming I am on the right track). There are probably ways to update the wiki otherwise but I wanted to get some attention on this before we did that. (cc Patrick Hunt, Eugene Koontz).
