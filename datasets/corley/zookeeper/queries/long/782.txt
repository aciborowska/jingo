 The C API Doxygen documentation states:

" .... If the client is ever disconnected from the service, even if the
  disconnection is temporary, the watches of the client will be removed from
  the service, so a client must treat a disconnect notification as an implicit
  trigger of all outstanding watches."

This is incorrect as of v.3. Watches are only lost and need to be re-registered when a session times out. When a normal disconnection occurs watches are reset automatically on reconnection.

The documentation in zookeeper.h needs to be updated to correct this explanation.
