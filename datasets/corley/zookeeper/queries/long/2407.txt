EventThread in ClientCnxn can't be closed when SendThread exits because of auth failed during reconnection.
for send thread if it is in authfailed state, the send thread exits,but the event thread is still running.

observation:
use jstack tho check the thread running they find the send thread no longer exists but event thread is still threre
even when we call zookeeper.close(),the eventthread is still there.
