When the c unit tests are run sometimes the server doesn't shutdown at the end of the test, this causes subsequent tests (hudson esp) to fail.

1) we should try harder to make the server shut down at the end of the test, I suspect this is related to test failing/cleanup
2) before the tests are run we should see if the old server is still running and try to shut it down
