HBase is planning to make use of the native ZooKeeper libraries in order to have small session timeouts that aren't affected by GC pauses (see HBASE-1316). The current patch uses a custom maven packaging of the ZooKeeper native libraries. It would be nice if ZooKeeper published those artifacts as part of its release process.
