We'd greatly benefit from long-running performance and stress tests that ran, say, nightly.

One thing I've done in the past is automatically run a set of classes with profiling enabled and periodically captured telemetry. Would be great to run something like this regularly as well, if the Hudson infrastructure were capable of doing so.
