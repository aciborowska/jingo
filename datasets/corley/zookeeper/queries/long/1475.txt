Messages about unconfigured JAAS settings probably should not be logged at WARN level because it's intentional if the user is not using any SASL based security features. The user may conclude that security is not optional, or that the missing JAAS configuration is behind failures that have an unrelated cause. Perhaps INFO level instead.
