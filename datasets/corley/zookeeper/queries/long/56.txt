Clover is what ASF uses for code coverage. We currently have cobertura, but need to add support for clover (keep the existing cobertura support for individual developers to use). Clover is run automatically by ASF Hudson.

Hadoop has support for clover in their build.xml, port their clover related targets into zookeeper build.xml
