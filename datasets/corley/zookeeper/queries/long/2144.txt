The current auth info implementation makes it very difficult to work with expiring auth info.  If a client fails over between servers, it resends its list of auth info in a FIFO order.  Therefore, if any of the info has expired, it'll cause the session to be lost.  There is currently no way to update or remove any existing info, only add.  Any objections to adding an update or remove auth info method?

An alternate solution would be for ClientCnxn.AuthData to implement an equals method that only checks the scheme field.  As the AuthData is stored in a set, this would have the same effect as an update operation.  However, I'm not sure if there is a use case for supplying multiple bits of AuthData for the same scheme?
