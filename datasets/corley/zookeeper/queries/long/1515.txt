In zookeeper 3.3.5 in file src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/Learner.java:325 you may see Thread.sleep(1000);

This is always happens after leader failure or restart. Zookeeper reelects new leader and all followers try to connect to it. But first attempt always fails because of "Connection refused":


2012-07-23 18:55:48,159 - WARN  [QuorumPeer:/0.0.0.0:2181:Learner@229] - Unexpected exception, tries=0, connecting to web329.local/192.168.1.74:2888

I propose to change this line to the next code:

Learner.java
if (tries > 0) {
    Thread.sleep(self.tickTime);
}



This way first reconnect attempt will be done immediately, other will wait for tick time (this is good semantic change, I suppose).

The result of this change - leader reelection time lowered from >1500ms to 300-400ms with 50ms tick time. This is pretty important for our production environment and will not break any existing installations.
