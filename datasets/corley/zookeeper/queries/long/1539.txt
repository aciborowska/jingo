Consider the following test:

@Test
public void newTest() throws Exception {
    QuorumUtil qu = new QuorumUtil(3);
    qu.startAll();
}

Although it doesn't seem like we're checking anything at all here, this test actually fails. There is a JMXEnv.ensureAll test invoked from startAll(). It passes for QuorumUtil(1) or QuorumUtil(2) servers but fails for any larger number. Besides the fact that there's a bug in the tests, I think we should call the function differently if we want to invoke tests in it, or alternatively remove these tests or make them optional using some parameter.
