After reviewing the ClientCnxn code, there is still chances of exiting the SendThread without intimating the users. Say if client throws OOMError and entered into the throwable block. Here again while sending the Disconnected event, its creating "new WatchedEvent()" object.This will throw OOMError and leads to exit the SendThread without any Disconnected event notification.


try{
    //...
} catch (Throwable e)
{
    //..
    cleanup();
   if(state.isAlive()){
        eventThread.queueEvent(
        new WatchedEvent(Event.EventType.None, Event.KeeperState.Disconnected, null) )
   }
   //....
}
