If you go to the create method documentation here:
http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.6/api/index.html

Then you see:

public String create(String path,
            byte[] data,
            List<ACL> acl,
            CreateMode createMode)
              throws KeeperException,
                     InterruptedException
Create a node with the given path. The node data will be the given data, and node acl will be the given acl.
The flags argument specifies whether the created node will be ephemeral or not.

An ephemeral node will be removed by the ZooKeeper automatically when the session associated with the creation of the node expires.

The flags argument can also specify to create a sequential node. The actual path name of a sequential node will be the given path plus a suffix "i" where i is the current sequential number of the node. The sequence number is always fixed length of 10 digits, 0 padded. Once such a node is created, the sequential number will be incremented by one.



While there are 'path', 'data', 'acl', and 'createMode' arguments, there is no "flags argument".  This documentation needs to be corrected to be clear, unambiguous, and perhaps provide and example.
