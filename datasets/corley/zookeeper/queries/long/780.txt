I'm starting to play with Zookeeper so I'm still running it in standalone mode. This is not a big issue, but here it goes for the records. 

I've run zkCli.sh to run some commands in the server. I created a znode /groups. When I tried to create a znode client_1 inside /groups, I forgot to include the data: an exception was generated and zkCli-sh crashed, instead of just showing an error. I tried a few variations and it seems like the problem is not including the data.

A copy of the screen:

[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 3] create /groups firstgroup
Created /groups
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 4] create -e /groups/client_1
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 3
