We have seen a number of times users failing to get an ensemble up because the snapshot transfer times out. We should be able to do better than this and calibrate initLimit dynamically. I was thinking concretely that we could have servers increasing the initLimit value (e.g., doubling or increments of 1) upon socket timeouts. The tricky part here is that we need both ends of the communication to increase it.
