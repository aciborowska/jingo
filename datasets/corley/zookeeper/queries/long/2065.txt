The Debian control file sets a dependency on sun-java6-jre. We currently run Zookeeper in production with Java 1.7. This makes it difficult to support in our environment since it attempts to install an older JRE upon package installation.

I propose that we change this line from sun-java6-jre to default-jre. Then the operator of the system can choose which Java version to run with.
