Currently, netty server is setting up child channel in this way:

 bootstrap.getPipeline().addLast("servercnxnfactory", channelHandler);



According to the netty doc,
you cannot use this approach if you are going to open more than one Channels or run a server that accepts incoming connections to create its child channels.
