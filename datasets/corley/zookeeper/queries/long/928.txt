In Follower.followLeader() after syncing with the leader, the follower does:
                while (self.isRunning()) 
{
                    readPacket(qp);
                    processPacket(qp);
                }

It looks like it relies on socket timeout expiry to figure out if the connection with the leader has gone down.  So a follower with no cilents may never notice a faulty leader if a Leader has a software hang, but the TCP connections with the peers are still valid. Since it has no cilents, it won't hearbeat with the Leader. If majority of followers are not connected to any clients, then FLE will fail even if other followers attempt to elect a new leader.

We should keep track of pings received from the leader and see if we havent seen
a ping packet from the leader for (syncLimit * tickTime) time and give up following the
leader.
