I think there is a race condition that is probably easy to get into with the old leader election and a large number of servers:

1) Leader dies
2) Followers start looking for a new leader before all Followers have abandoned the Leader
3) The Followers looking for a new leader see votes of Followers still following the (now dead) Leader and start voting for the dead Leader
4) The dead Leader gets reelected.

For the old leader election a server should not vote for another server that is not nominating himself.
