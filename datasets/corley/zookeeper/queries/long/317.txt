A number of functions in the 3.x.x C API such as add_to_list() and getImpl() from zk_hashtable.c and data_result_checker() and child_result_checker() from zookeeper.c could be marked static and removed from the set of exported functions.

Since this change would remove functions from the API, it should wait for 4.0.0.
