When zookeeper quorum recovers from shutdown/crash, a client with a local session will reconnect to a random server in quorum. If this random-chosen server is not leader and does not own the local session previously, it will forward this session to leader for validation. And then if this is a global session, leader will update its owner, if not, leader adds Boolean false to packet and does nothing. 

Since our system involves mostly local session and has a large amount of connections, this procedure may be redundant and add potential pressure to leader. Is this reasonable for the reconnect scenario that local session validation not forward to leader, instead return by follower directly?
