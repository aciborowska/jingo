If I try delete test without the leading /, then the CLI crashes with this exception:


Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Path must start with / character
	at org.apache.zookeeper.common.PathUtils.validatePath(PathUtils.java:51)
	at org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeper.delete(ZooKeeper.java:1659)
	at org.apache.zookeeper.cli.DeleteCommand.exec(DeleteCommand.java:83)
	at org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeperMain.processZKCmd(ZooKeeperMain.java:655)
	at org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeperMain.processCmd(ZooKeeperMain.java:586)

It should really fail the operation rather than crash the CLI.
