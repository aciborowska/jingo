Monitoring Recipes And Web-based Administrative Interface
Mentor: Patrick Hunt (phunt@apache.org)

Requirements:
Modern web platform - e.g. Django. Some design or UI skills would help. Java for adding methods to ZooKeeper.

Description:
ZooKeeper is a complex distributed system. Understanding how well it is running is tremendously important. Patrick Hunt has created a Django-based dashboard (see http://github.com/phunt/zookeeper_dashboard) that allows some insight into how ZooKeeper is running. This is a great foundation on which to build; however there are improvements that could be made! This project would capture much more information from ZooKeeper, adding hooks to retrieve it where necessary and visualise it in a appealing and useful way. Integration with Ganglia would be a definite plus.
