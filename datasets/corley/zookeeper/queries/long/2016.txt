ZOOKEEPER-1355 introduced client-side rebalancing, which is implemented in both the C and Java client libraries. However, it requires the client to detect a configuration change and call updateServerList with the new connection string (see reconfig manual). It may be better if the client just indicates that he is interested in this feature when creating a ZK handle and we'll detect configuration changes and invoke updateServerList for him underneath the hood.
