The following code may result in a data race due to unsafe publication of a reference to "this". The call to cnxn.start() spawns threads that have access to the partially-constructed reference to the ZooKeeper object. 

See http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp0618.html for some background info.


public ZooKeeper(String connectString, int sessionTimeout, Watcher watcher)
    throws IOException
{
        .....
        cnxn = new ClientCnxn(connectString, sessionTimeout, this, watchManager);
        cnxn.start();
}



The obvious fix is to move the call to cnxn.start() into a separate start() method.
