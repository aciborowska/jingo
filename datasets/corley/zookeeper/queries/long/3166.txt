The reconfig operation supports changing the plaintext client port and client address but, because the secure client port is not encoded in the QuorumVerifier serialization, the secure client port cannot be changed by similar means. Instead, this information can only be changed in the static configuration files and only viewed there.

Flagging as a place where there's not feature parity between secure client ports and plaintext client ports.
