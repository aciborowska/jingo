During the conversion of mainline tests from JUnit into TestNG it has been noticed (partially because TestNG doesn't intercept tests output) that some of log4j configuration parameters aren't very handy. E.g.

	some of really non-important messages go at WARN level
	by default all output goes into ConsoleAppender, which is a lot and makes it difficult to trace the execution from simply observing the console output
	it'd be good to have a couple different log4j configs to be able to turn ConsoleAppender on and off by simply passing a parameter to ant build
