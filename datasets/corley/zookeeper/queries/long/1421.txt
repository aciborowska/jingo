Using ZK as a service, we need to restrict access to subtrees owned by different tenants. Currently there is no support for hierarchical ACLs, so it is necessary to configure the clients not only with their parent node, but also manage the ACL for each new node created in the subtree. With support for hierarchical ACLs, duplication could be avoided and the setup of the parent nodes with ACL and subsequent control of the same could be split into a separate administrative task.
