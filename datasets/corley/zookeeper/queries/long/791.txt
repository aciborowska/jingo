I start 2 of 3 servers of an ensemble, connect to it with zkCli.sh, do "ls / 1" which registers a watch.
Then I kill one of 2 servers which makes alive one to lose a quorum and forces client to reconnect. 

And when the client connects to this alive server (but gets quickly dropped by the server afterwards), watch is triggered:
WatchedEvent state:SyncConnected type:NodeChildrenChanged path:/ 

I can reproduce it only with command-line client, and quite rarely. I tried to write unit test, but id didn't catch this.
Has anybody seen this before?
