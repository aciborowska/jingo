In bin/zkEnv.sh The ZOOCFG variable is duplicated over itself if already set. For example, in my use case it was being set in zookeeper-env.sh. The problem seems to arise from this line (line 61 on the master branch at the time of this submission): ZOOCFG="$ZOOCFGDIR/$ZOOCFG". This overwrites the value of ZOOCFG by appending the old value to the value of ZOOCFGDIR, which is problematic if it was already initialized as the absolute path to a file. The behavior of overwriting the value of the variable in this way seems to be specific to the case where ZOOCFG is not initialized. The final state of ZOOCFG seemingly is the absolute path to the zookeeper configuration file. This behavior assumes that it is the filename only, which is where the bug arises.
