Some clients maybe a heavy bandwidth user. It is possible for the total network traffic to reach NIC capacity and service quality start to degrade. We don't want these clients to affect the QoS of other clients sharing the same server.  

In this improvement, we are going to add per-connection throttling mechanism which will slow down the network activity of clients with high bandwidth usage. We will add configurable parameter to limit maximum bandwidth which will be used to serve client requests. All client get equal amount of bandwidth when system approach its network capacity limit. When the system in under-utilize, throttling has no effect.
