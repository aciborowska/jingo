Zookeeper currently allows two type of nodes: EPHEMERAL and PERSISTENT. If the node or node data needs to be referenced from other nodes, entire node needs to be copied to new location. There is no relation between the original and copied nodes. Symbolic nodes like in unix directory structure would keep the nodes and node data in sync.

Use case:
While implementing managed clusters for micro shards strategy, client can register by creating Ephemeral nodes. The master process can then create new symbolic nodes along with other clients nodes for next set of processes to watch. If the client goes down, the ephemeral node cleans itself along with symbolic node. There could be different set of watchers on symbolic nodes which would then get notified.
