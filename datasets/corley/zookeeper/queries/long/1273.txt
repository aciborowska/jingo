Probably caused by the usage of a legacy VCS a code duplication happened when you moved from Sourceforge to Apache (ZOOKEEPER-38). The following file can be deleted:
src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/server/DataTreeUnitTest.java

src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/test/DataTreeTest.java was an exact copy of the above until ZOOKEEPER-1046 added an additional test case only to the latter.

Do I need to upload a patch file for this?
