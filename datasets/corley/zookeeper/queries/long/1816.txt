In the testing of ACCUMULO-1379 and ACCUMULO-1858 it was seen that the non-blocking behavior of ClientCnxn.close(), and therefore ZooKeeper.close(), can cause a race condition when undeploying an application running in a Java container such as JBoss or Tomcat. As the close() method returns without joining on the sendThread and eventThread, those threads continue to execute/cleanup while the container is cleaning up the application's resources. If the container has unloaded classes by the time this code runs


ZooTrace.logTraceMessage(LOG, ZooTrace.getTextTraceLevel(), "SendThread exitedloop.");



A "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/zookeeper/server/ZooTrace" can be seen.
