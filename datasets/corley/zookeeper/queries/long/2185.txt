Continuing to run a server process after it runs out of memory can lead to unexpected behavior.  This issue proposes that we update scripts and documentation to add these JVM options:

	-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError for help with post-mortem analysis of why the process ran out of memory.
	-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError='kill %p' to kill the JVM process, under the assumption that a process monitor will restart it.
