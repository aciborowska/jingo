A few simple changes would simplify using ZooInspector a lot.  


	Alphabetical order of nodes on a tree view
	Short term caching of zookeeper nodes for faster rendering of node tree
	Add/Delete node in context menu of a node
	Keyboard shortcuts for add/deleting a node
	Logging information that ZooInspector failed to load nodeViewers
