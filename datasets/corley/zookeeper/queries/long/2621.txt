The ZooKeeper scripts fail due to missing cygpath path conversion in a MINGW32 environment, such as when running from git bash (installed by default when installing Git for Windows).

The fix is to add the line

MINGW*) cygwin=true ;;
near the bottom of the zkEnv.sh script, in the case statement that checks for a cygwin environment.
