from question on the user mailing list:

the "Reliability in the Presence of Errors" graph on http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/current/zookeeperOver.html does not list how many ZooKeeper quorum nodes are in use, or the fraction of reads/writes.

ben mentioned:

Here is the missing text:
To show the behavior of the system over time as failures are injected we
ran a ZooKeeper service made up of 7 machines. We ran the same
saturation benchmark as before, but this time we kept the write
percentage at a constant 30%, which is a conservative ratio of our
expected workloads.
