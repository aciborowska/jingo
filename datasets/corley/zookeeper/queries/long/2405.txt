We're logging the kerberos ticket when in debug mode, probably not the best idea. This was identified as a "critical" issue by Fortify.


        for(KerberosTicket ticket: tickets) {
            KerberosPrincipal server = ticket.getServer();
            if (server.getName().equals("krbtgt/" + server.getRealm() + "@" + server.getRealm())) {
                LOG.debug("Found tgt " + ticket + ".");
                return ticket;
            }
        }
