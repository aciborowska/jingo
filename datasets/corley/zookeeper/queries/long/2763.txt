org.apache.jute.Utils.toCsvBuffer(), which converts a byte array to a string containing the hex representation of that byte array, omits the leading zero for any byte less than 0x10, due to its use of Integer.toHexString, which has the same behavior.

https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/main/org/apache/jute/Utils.java#L234

One consequence of this is that the hex strings printed by ClientCnxn.Packet.toString(), used in the debug logging for ClientCnxn.readResponse(), cannot be parsed to determine the result of a Zookeeper request from client debug logs.

Utils.toXmlBuffer() appears to have the same issue.
