The git pull request commit flow script (zk-merge-pr.py) has a feature that sometimes (e.g. if skipping "resolve JIRA" step, it happened a couple of times to me), it will not automatically close the pull request once a pull request is merged. An improvement here would be nice, so every merge will follow with the closing of merged pull request, otherwise either the original author of the pull request, or Apache Infra has to close the pull request which is less convenient.
