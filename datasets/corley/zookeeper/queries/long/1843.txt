I was reading ByteBufferInputStream.java; here is the skip method:

    public long skip(long n) throws IOException {
        long newPos = bb.position() + n;
        if (newPos > bb.remaining()) 
{
            n = bb.remaining();
        }
        bb.position(bb.position() + (int) n);
        return n;
    }

The first two lines look wrong; we compare a "point" (position) to a "distance" (remaining).  I think the test should be if (newPos >= bb.limit()).

Or more simply:
    public long skip(long n) throws IOException {
        int remaining = buffer.remaining();
        if (n > remaining) 
{
            n = remaining;
        }
        buffer.position(buffer.position() + (int) n);
        return n;
    }
