public final class ConnectStringParser {
...
   public ConnectStringParser(String connectString) {
   ...


ConnectStringParser is a public api. Besides that, both ZooKeeper constructor and ZooKeeper#updateServerList used it.

However, it doesn't handle a null connectString. It doesn't help that much to see a NPE showing up. So I add a check to the constructor.
