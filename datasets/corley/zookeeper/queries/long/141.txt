The patch of JIRA 127 replaces InetSocket objects with server ids on QuorumCnxManager. Server ids are unique by assumption, and can be used instead of the randomly generated challenges we have currently. I suggest that we make this modification, and we use server ids as the challenge values instead of randomly generated numbers.
