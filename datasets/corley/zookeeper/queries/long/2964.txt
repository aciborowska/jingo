I foung a bug that "conf" command would return dataDir and dataLogDir opposingly.

This bug only exists in versions newer than 3.5. I only found dumpConf in ZookeeperServer.java prints these two paths opposingly. Unlike ZOOKEEPER-2960, the actual paths are not affected and server function is ok.

I made a small patch to fix this bug. Any review is appreciated.
