2 years ago (in https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/103), Netty changed their group-id from org.jboss.netty to io.netty. ZooKeeper is still on the 3.2.5, so applications using 3.3 cannot use the maven "dependencyManagement" feature, as the group id differ. HBase & Hadoop 2 are on the branch 3.3+, with the new group id.

Note that the netty 4 changes the package name as well. That's not the case for Netty 3.3+.
