nc closes the write channel as soon as it's sent it's information, for example "echo stat|nc localhost 2181"
in general this is fine, however the server code will close the socket as soon as it receives notice that nc has
closed it's write channel. if not all the 4 letter word result has been written back to the client yet, this will cause
some or all of the result to be lost - ie the client will not see the full result. this was introduced in 3.3.0 as part
of a change to reduce blocking of the selector by long running 4letter words.

here's an example of the logs from the server during this

echo -n stat | nc localhost 2181
