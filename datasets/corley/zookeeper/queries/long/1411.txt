Currently every server has a different static configuration file. This patch distinguishes between dynamic parameters, which are now in a separate "dynamic configuration file", and static parameters which are in the usual file. The config file points to the dynamic config file by specifying "dynamicConfigFile=...". In the first stage (this patch), all cluster membership definitions are in the dynamic config file, but in the future additional parameters may be moved to the dynamic file.

Backward compatibility makes sure that you can still use a single config file if you'd like. Only when the config is changed (once ZK-107 is in) a dynamic file is automatically created and the necessary parameters are moved to it. 

This patch also moves all membership parsing and management into the QuorumVerifier classes, and removes QuorumPeer.quorumPeers.
The cluster membership is contained in QuorumPeer.quorumVerifier. QuorumVerifier was expanded and now has methods such as getAllMembers(), getVotingMembers(), getObservingMembers().
