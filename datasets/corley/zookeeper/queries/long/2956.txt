We cannot delete znode that owns too many child znodes by `rmr` command, due to the list of child znodes could be 172 MB, which is too huge for the default value of `jute.maxbuffer` (1MB). In fact, we shouldn't be effected by the number of child znodes when we want to delete some special znodes recursively.
