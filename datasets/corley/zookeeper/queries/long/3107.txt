I'm new to the Zookeeper as a contributor.

Was going through https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/HowToContribute a and noticed that link to Sun's conventions doesn't work. Did some googling and noticed that it is archived at https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/codeconvtoc-136057.html.

 

Do we still use this coding standard?

Apart from the code styling rules, we have additional ones listed on the Contributor Guide.

Instead of letting everyone remember all the rules, should we force it at build time?

 

There is a Maven Checkstyle Plugin  which can be leveraged.
