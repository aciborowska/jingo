The current handling of zookeeper.security.auth_to_local in KerberosName.java only supports rules given directly as property value.

These rules must therefore be given on the command line and:

	must be escaped properly to avoid shell expansion
	are visible in the ps output



It would be much better to put these rules in a file and pass the file path as the property value. We would then use something like -Dzookeeper.security.auth_to_local=file:/etc/zookeeper/rules.

Note that using the file: prefix allows keeping backward compatibility.
