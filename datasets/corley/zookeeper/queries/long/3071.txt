Currently we only have a knob to control maximum number of transactions in the log file but there is no direct way to control actual size of the file. This has implications on the time it takes for a learner to sync using transaction log as the leader needs to seek the file to find the appropriate transaction. This is a proposal for adding a config parameter to control the transaction log size.
