The java client (and someone should also review the c client) is generating a syncdisconnected even if the client is currently in the disconnected state. We saw this with a user running the java client against a down standalone server (server not running, connection refused) - the "syncdisconnected" is generated by the client lib each time a connection attempt (fails) is made. Should only be generated once.
