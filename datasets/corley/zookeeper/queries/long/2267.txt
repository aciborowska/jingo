zoo_amulti will always return ZMARSHALLINGERROR whenever the zhandle is in an unrecoverable state. ZINVALIDSTATE should probably be returned in these situations.

Preferably the return code from the relevant error should be returned as is. At the very least it would be nice if zoo_amulti first checked is_unrecoverable, the way zoo_awget does. It seems the other async functions are implicitly doing this in the *Request_init calls.
