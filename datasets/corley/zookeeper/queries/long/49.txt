As reported by Shane:

Still exploring the ACL stuff in Zookeeper.  Tried using setACL for a  
path but get InvalidACL error thrown .... looking at pRequest in  
PrepRequestProcessor ... and in particular these lines ...


                 SetACLRequest setAclRequest = new SetACLRequest();
                 if (!fixupACL(request.authInfo,  
setAclRequest.getAcl())) 
{
                     throw new KeeperException(Code.InvalidACL);
                 }

a new SetACLRequest will return a null when called in fixupACL  
returning false and throwing the exception .... as far as I can see.
