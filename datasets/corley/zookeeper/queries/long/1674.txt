It is interesting to notice the piece of codes in QuorumPeer.java

 /* ZKDatabase is a top level member of quorumpeer 

	which will be used in all the zookeeperservers
	instantiated later. Also, it is created once on
	bootup and only thrown away in case of a truncate
	message from the leader
     */
    private ZKDatabase zkDb;



It is introduced by ZOOKEEPER-596. Now, we just drop the database every leader election.

We can keep it safely with ZOOKEEPER-1549.
