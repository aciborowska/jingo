Cleanup the event messages output by the java command line client:

The java client ZooKeeper.java has a process method in MyWatcher that prints raw event information to the console. Many new users find this confusing (esp since state changes have a null path). 

        public void process(WatcherEvent event) 
{
            System.err.println(event.getPath() + ": " + event.getState() + "-"
                    + event.getType());
        }

If this is a state change we should print that, if it's an event we should print that (state change doesn't have a path). Somewhere in the message we should also indicate that the client received a watch notification from the server.
