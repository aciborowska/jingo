One user saw a case where a single mis-programmed client was overloading the server with connections - the client was creating a huge number of sessions to the server. This caused all of the fds on the  server to become used.

Seems like we should have some way of limiting (configurable override) the maximum number of sessions from a single client (say 10 by default?) Also we should output warnings when this limit is exceeded (or attempt to exceed).
