When re-electing a new leader of a cluster, it takes a long time for the cluster to become available if the dataset is large

Test Data
----------
650mb snapshot size
20k nodes of varied size 
3 member cluster 

On 3.4.x branch (http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/zookeeper/branches/branch-3.4?r=1244779)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Takes 3-4 minutes to bring up a cluster from cold 
Takes 40-50 secs to recover from a leader failure 
Takes 10 secs for a new follower to join the cluster 

Using the 3.3.5 release on the same hardware with the same dataset
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Takes 10-20 secs to bring up a cluster from cold 
Takes 10 secs to recover from a leader failure 
Takes 10 secs for a new follower to join the cluster 

I can see from the logs in 3.4.x that once a new leader is elected, it pushes a new snapshot to each of the followers who need to save it before they ack the leader who can then mark the cluster as available. 

The kit being used is a low spec vm so the times taken are not relevant per se - more the fact that a snapshot is always sent even through there is no difference between the persisted state on each peer.
No data is being added to the cluster while the peers are being restarted.
