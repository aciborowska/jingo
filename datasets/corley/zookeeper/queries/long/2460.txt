during the vote of 3.5.2-ALPHA RC 0 we found a Maven dependency to javacc in published pom for zookeeper


<dependency>
<groupId>net.java.dev.javacc</groupId>
<artifactId>javacc</artifactId>
<version>5.0</version><scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>



this dependency appears not to be useful and should be removed

this was the tested pom: https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/staging/org/apache/zookeeper/zookeeper/3.5.2-alpha/zookeeper-3.5.2-alpha.pom
