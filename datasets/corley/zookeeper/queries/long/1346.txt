Move the 4lws to their own port, off of the client port, and support them properly via long-lived sessions instead of polling. Deprecate the 4lw support on the client port. Will enable us to enhance the functionality of the commands via extended command syntax, address security concerns and fix bugs involving the socket close being received before all of the data on the client end.
