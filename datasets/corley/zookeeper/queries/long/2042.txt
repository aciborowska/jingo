There are two issues in the zkServer.sh script that make it not work properly out of the box on Solaris.

1. The bin/zkServer.sh script uses plain "echo" in all instances but one: when writing the pid to the pid file.  In that instance it uses "/bin/echo".

The "/bin/echo" command on Solaris does not understand the "-n" parameter and interprets it as a literal string, so the "-n" gets written into the pid file along with the pid.  This causes the "stop" command to fail.

2. The /bin/grep command in Solaris does not understand special character classes like "[[:space:]]".  You must use the alternate posix version of grep as found in /usr/xpg4/bin/grep for this to work.  If the script cannot be made completely generic then at least we should document the need to use the posix grep implementation on Solaris.
