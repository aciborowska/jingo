The jute maxbuffer size is documented as being defaulted to 1 megabyte in the administrators guide.  I believe that this is true server side but it is not true client side.  On the client side the default is (at least in 3.3.2) this:

packetLen = Integer.getInteger("jute.maxbuffer", 4096 * 1024);

On the server side the documentation looks to be correct:
    private static int determineMaxBuffer() {
        String maxBufferString = System.getProperty("jute.maxbuffer");
        try 
{
            return Integer.parseInt(maxBufferString);
        }
 catch(Exception e) 
{
            return 0xfffff;
        }

    }

The documentation states this:
jute.maxbuffer:
(Java system property: jute.maxbuffer)

This option can only be set as a Java system property. There is no zookeeper prefix on it. It specifies the maximum size of the data that can be stored in a znode. The default is 0xfffff, or just under 1M. If this option is changed, the system property must be set on all servers and clients otherwise problems will arise. This is really a sanity check. ZooKeeper is designed to store data on the order of kilobytes in size.
