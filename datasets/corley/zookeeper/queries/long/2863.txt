When downloading a config (ex: a Solr config) from Zookeeper 3.4.10, if a file is empty, it is downloaded as a folder (on Windows, at least).

A Zookeeper browser (Eclipse: Zookeeper Explorer) shows the file as a file, however, in ZK.

Noticed because we keep an empty synonyms.txt file in the Solr config provided with our product, in case a client would want to use it.

The workaround is simple, if the file allows comments: just add a comment, so it is not empty.
