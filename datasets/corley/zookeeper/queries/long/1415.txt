Not setting the ecf.exported.containerfactoryargs property when publishing an OSGi service through Zookeeper results in the service being published under the host's hostname instead of its IP. This means that hosts not able to correctly resolve that hostname cannot connect to its ZooKeeper instance. It would be desirable to use the IP instead of the hostname when that property is purposely left blank e.g. when it is unknown where the application will be deployed.
