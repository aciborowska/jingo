Currently 3.5.3 is tagged as alpha both in build and JIRA. We should reach a consensus on the tag before release. See the email thread on dev list for more details.

Deliverable:

	A consensus on using beta as the version for 3.5.3 release.
	Update build.xml.
	Update JIRA (3.5.3-alpha -> 3.5.3-beta).
