Assertion for testLostMessage is kept inside the thread.run() method. Due to this the assertion failure will not be reflected in the main testcase. 
I have observed the test case is still passing in case of the assert failure or misfunction. Instead, the assertion can be moved to the test case - testLostMessage.


class LEThread extends Thread {
          public void run(){
                peer.setCurrentVote(v);
                LOG.info("Finished election: " + i + ", " + v.getId());
                Assert.assertTrue("State is not leading.", peer.getPeerState() == ServerState.LEADING);
             }
