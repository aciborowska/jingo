Using the same Vagrant provisioning script as for 3.5.2-alpha, suddenly all monitoring tools told me that the ZK instance was unavailable or had an error. Investigating further, the instance was fine as a follower, but the response to telnet "ruok" was actually "ruok ... is not in the whitelist".
Is this a new default not reflected in the documentation yet? It says since 3.4.10 there's a whitelist option, but all commands are by default on it (same as 4lw.commands.whitelist=*).
