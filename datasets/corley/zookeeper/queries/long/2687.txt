Leader server enters into deadlock while shutting down. This happens some time only.
The reason and deadlock flow is same as ZOOKEEPER-2380.
shutdown was removed from synchronized block in ZOOKEEPER-2380
Now shutdown is called from synchronized block from another place.

// check leader running status
if (!this.isRunning()) {
    shutdown("Unexpected internal error");
    return;
}
