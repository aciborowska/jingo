Have a cluster of 3 zookeepers
90 clients are connected to the server
leader got killed and started
the other 2 zookeeper started FLE and Leader was elected

But its taking nearly 10 sec for this server to server requests and saying "ZooKeeperServer not running" message..?

Why is this even after Leader election SERVER IS NOT RUNNING !!!!!!!!!!
