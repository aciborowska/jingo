I am trying to test SSL connectivity between client and server following the instructions in the following page:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/ZooKeeper+SSL+User+Guide
But, I get the following when trying to connect to server from client..
2015-06-24 12:14:36,589 [myid:] - INFO [main:ZooKeeper@709] - Initiating client connection, connectString=localhost:2282 sessionTimeout=30000 watcher=org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeperMain$MyWatcher@f2a0b8e
Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: Couldn't instantiate org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxnSocketNetty
Can you tell me what I am doing wrong here?
Very new to Zookeeper. 
Thanks!
