Hi, 
I have a five nodes cluster versioned 3.4.5 and now i find one node is offline.
Firstly i restart the node but i find that "Error contacting service. It is probably not running." and i find that the node always elect the leader and always sync the snapshot logs and the device will be full every ten mins. 
so could someone help meï¼Ÿ i will put the log and zoo.cfg in the attachment.
Thanks all.
yyx,
