"snap" command can be used to trigger log rotate and snapshotting on each server. 

One use case for this command is to make server restart faster by issuing snap command before restarting the server. This help when txnlog is large (due to txn size or number of txn)

snap is a blocking command, it will return when snapshot is written to disk. So it is safe to call this prior to restarting the server.
