In zkCli.sh, the CLIENT_JVMFLAGS are being passed along with regular JVMFLAGS, so the latter ends up overriding it anyhow if set. Can we please remove JVMFLAGS completely from clients, if CLIENT_JVMFLAGS are also set (i.e. use just one). 

One example of how this can be detrimental is if you attempt to start a zookeeper-client session on the same host that is already running zookeeper and use the default config directory. If the zookeeper server has jmx enabled than the client will also pick up that port and attempt to bind resulting in a failure


	/usr/bin/zookeeper-client
Error: Exception thrown by the agent : java.rmi.server.ExportException: Port already in use: 9010; nested exception is: 
java.net.BindException: Address already in use
