when setquota for a znode and set ip/user ACL on /zookeeper/quota, still able to delete the quota from client with another ip though it says "Authentication is not valid"


>> Set quota and ip ACL from one client (with IP 10.18.101.80)
[zk: 10.18.101.80:2181(CONNECTED) 9] setquota -n 10 /test
[zk: 10.18.101.80:2181(CONNECTED) 10] setAcl /zookeeper/quota ip:10.18.101.80:crdwa
[zk: 10.18.101.80:2181(CONNECTED) 11] 


>> Try to delete the set quota using different client(with ip 10.18.219.50)
[zk: 10.18.219.50:2181(CONNECTED) 22] listquota /test
absolute path is /zookeeper/quota/test/zookeeper_limits
Output quota for /test count=10,bytes=-1
Output stat for /test count=1,bytes=5
[zk: 10.18.219.50:2181(CONNECTED) 23] delquota /test
Authentication is not valid : /zookeeper/quota/test
[zk: 10.18.219.50:2181(CONNECTED) 24] listquota /test
absolute path is /zookeeper/quota/test/zookeeper_limits
quota for /test does not exist.

>> Here quota has been deleted though it is saying "Authentication is not valid.." which is not correct.
Now try to set the quota from another ip itself, it fails which is as expected

[zk: 10.18.219.50:2181(CONNECTED) 25] setquota -n 10 /test
Authentication is not valid : /zookeeper/quota/test
[zk: 10.18.219.50:2181(CONNECTED) 26] listquota /test
absolute path is /zookeeper/quota/test/zookeeper_limits
quota for /test does not exist.
