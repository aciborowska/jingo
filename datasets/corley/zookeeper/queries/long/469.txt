When compiling with --with-cppunit-prefix, CPPUNIT_CFLAGS is set by the AM_PATH_CPPUNIT macro.  In configure.ac, it is then reset in order to set the -DZKSERVER_CMD command line argument.  Instead, that argument should be added to CPPUNIT_CFLAGS so that things like a custom -I include location set by AM_PATH_CPPUNIT are not lost.  Otherwise, a custom cppunit installation is not properly supported, despite the --with-cppunit-prefix option.
