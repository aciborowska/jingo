I watched the source of the zookeeper class and I missed an acl check in the asynchronous version of the create operation. Is there any reason, that in the asynch version is no
check whether the acl is valid, or did someone forget to implement it. It's interesting because we worked on a refactoring of the zookeeper client and don't want to implement a bug.

The following code is missing:
        if (acl != null && acl.size() == 0) 
{
            throw new KeeperException.InvalidACLException();
        }
