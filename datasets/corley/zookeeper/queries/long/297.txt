There are now three locations in the source repository that store the version number of the code:

1) build.xml
2) configure.ac
3) zookeeper_version.h

these all have to be managed when releasing/branching/etc... would be better if there were just one place - at the very least the configure.ac should be used to generate the version for zookeeper_version.h. 

Can we do a better job (ie less) at this?
