This is a problem if you use zookeeper as a dependency in maven because for whatever reason the maven compiler plugin will pick up the java files in the jar and compile them to the output directory. From there they will land in the generated jar file for whatever project happens to depend on zookeeper thus introducing duplicate classes (once in zookeeper.jar, once in the project's artifact).
