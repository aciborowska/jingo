Findbug complains after ZOOKEEPER-3084:

DM_EXIT: Method invokes System.exit(...): Invoking System.exit shuts down the entire Java virtual machine. This should only been done when it is appropriate. Such calls make it hard or impossible for your code to be invoked by other code. Consider throwing a RuntimeException instead.

While in this case we should really quit so just make an exception for this case.
