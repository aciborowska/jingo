It would be nice to be able to root ZooKeeper handles at specific points in the namespace, so that applications that use ZooKeeper can work in their own rooted subtree.

For example, if ops decides that application X can use the subtree /apps/X and application Y can use the subtree /apps/Y, X can to a chroot to /apps/X and then all its path references can be rooted at /apps/X. Thus when X creates the path "/myid", it will actually be creating the path "/apps/X/myid".

There are two ways we can expose this mechanism: 1) We can simply add a chroot(String path) API, or 2) we can integrate into a service identifier scheme for example zk://server1:2181,server2:2181/my/root. I like the second form personally.
