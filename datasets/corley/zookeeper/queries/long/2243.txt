It refers to Solaris as Sun Solaris so it's at least 5 years out of date.

We should "support" the platforms that we are running zookeeper on regularly, so I suggest paring it down to linux and windows (mac os doesn't really count because people don't run it on servers anymore). Everything else should be "may work, not supported, but will fix obvious bugs".
