Currently the CnxnFactory checks for "java.security.auth.login.config" to decide whether or not enable SASL.

	zookeeper/server/NIOServerCnxnFactory.java
	zookeeper/server/NettyServerCnxnFactory.java
	
		configure() checks for "java.security.auth.login.config"
		
			If present start the new Login("Server", SaslServerCallbackHandler(conf))
		
		
	
	



But since the SaslServerCallbackHandler does the right thing just checking if getAppConfigurationEntry() is empty, we can allow SASL with JAAS configuration to be programmatically just checking weather or not a configuration entry is present instead of "java.security.auth.login.config".
(Something quite similar was done for the SaslClient in ZOOKEEPER-1373)
