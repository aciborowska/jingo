Many ZooKeeper properties are used as Java System properties in the ZooKeeper code.
Some example:

public static int getSnapCount() {
String sc = System.getProperty("zookeeper.snapCount");



public int getGlobalOutstandingLimit() { String sc = 
System.getProperty("zookeeper.globalOutstandingLimit");


Using ZooKeeper properties as Java system properties causes following 
problems 

	Can not create two or more ZooKeeper Server in a single JVM
with different properties for testing 
	The properties initialization and validation is very much mixed with actual business logic which should not be the case.
ZOOKEEPER-2139 removed the ZooKeeper client side Java System properties so as part of this jira handling only ZooKeeper server side  Java System properties to be removed.
