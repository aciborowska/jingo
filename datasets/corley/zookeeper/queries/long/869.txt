Currently, the leader election algorithm implemented guarantees that the leader has the maximum zxid of the ensemble. The state synchronization after the election was built based on this assumption. However, other leader elections algorithms might elect leaders with arbitrary zxid. 

To support other leader election algorithms, the state synchronization should allow the leader to have an arbitrary zxid.
