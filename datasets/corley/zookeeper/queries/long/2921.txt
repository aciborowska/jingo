FileTxnLog.commit() has a warning when an individual sync takes longer than fsyncWarningThresholdMS. However, it would also be useful to warn when the entire commit operation takes longer than fsyncWarningThresholdMS as this can cause client connection failures. Currently, commit() can take longer than 2/3 of a session but still not log a warning.
