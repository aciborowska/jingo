Proposed changes were discussed in this mailing list thread:

Basic goals are: 

	Decouple the current configuration system from the public API.  I
see stuff like ZooKeeperServer being coupled to ServerConfig a bit.
	Allow the use of setter injection in addition to constructor
injection. This is the most important thing needed to let spring more
easily configure the objects.
	Move the main() methods out of the ZooKeeperServer class.
