We're seeing some failing jobs (see below) and the speculation is that it might be due to ipv6 vs ipv4 usage. It would be nice to turn on "prefer ipv4" in the jvm but there is no easy way to do that. I'll propose that we add a variable to ant that's passed through to the jvm.


This is very odd. It failed 2 of the last three times it was run on H9
with the following:

2016-03-20 06:06:18,480 [myid:] - INFO
[main:JUnit4ZKTestRunner$LoggedInvokeMethod@74] - TEST METHOD FAILED
testBindByAddress
java.net.SocketException: No such device
at java.net.NetworkInterface.isLoopback0(Native Method)

at org.apache.zookeeper.test.ClientPortBindTest.testBindByAddress(ClientPortBindTest.java:61)

Why would it pass one of the times though if there is no loopback
device on the host? That seems very odd!
