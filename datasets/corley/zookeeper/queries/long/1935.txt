I want to determine whether a node adds or removes a child node. But based on the currently implementation, I can only to get the session event ZOO_CHILD_EVENT. There is no ways to determine whether it is an add child event or a delete child event.

If we enhance this event, it can benefit people having a similar requirement. Thanks.
