The approximateDataSize is a nice metric to show what's the total size stored in ZooKeeper ensemble over time, but it's expensive to query too often, since each query will go through all the nodes to calculate the total size.

It's better to use a counter to record the total data size when txns applied to the DataTree, which is cheaper.
