Hi,

I'm not really sure if this is a bug or a misunderstanding on my part, but I have the problem that, when I create a znode with an ACL as follows:


[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 60] create /anode "somecontent" digest:'user:IAEttLCxci/qWhKN2QJ6u1nrQgw=':cdrwa
Created /anode
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 61] getAcl /anode                                                               
'digest,''user:IAEttLCxci/qWhKN2QJ6u1nrQgw='
: cdrwa



I am not able to read or update the content of the node, as it should be:


[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 62] get /anode
Authentication is not valid : /anode
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 63] set /anode "update"                                                         
Authentication is not valid : /anode



But everyone without being authenticated can delete the node:


[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 64] delete /anode                                                               
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 65] get /anode         
Node does not exist: /anode



Is this a bug or is there a way to set the ACL so that only the user having the credentials can delete the znode?
