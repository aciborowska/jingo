If I try to execute 'bin/zkServer.sh status' while having
'-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9011' in $JVMFLAGS,
zookeeper quits with "Error: Exception thrown by the agent : java.rmi.server.ExportException: Port already in use: 9011".

EIther some other means of getting status should be used, or some way of not setting JMX variables in this case should be added.

Thanks
