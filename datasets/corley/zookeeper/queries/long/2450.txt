This JIRA recreates ZOOKEEPER-2432 which was deleted as the collateral damage during the spamming fighting effort Apache Infrastructure Team did weeks ago. Recreate the JIRA for the record so external documentations can link back to this JIRA.

The SslHandler in Netty before 3.9.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a crafted SSLv2Hello message [1]. We are using netty 3.7.x in ZK for 3.4/3.5/3.6, which is affected by this vulnerability.
