Both Java and C clients use signed 32-bit int as XIDs. XIDs are assumed to be non-negative, and zookeeper uses some negative values as special XIDs (e.g. -2 for ping, -4 for auth). However, neither Java nor C client ensures the XIDs it generates are non-negative, and the server doesn't reject negative XIDs.

Pat had some suggestions on how to fix this:


	(bin-compat) Expire the session when the client sends a negative XID.
	(bin-incompat) In addition to expiring the session, use 64-bit int for XID so that overflow will practically never happen.
