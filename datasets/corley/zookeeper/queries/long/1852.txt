ClientBase#createNewServerInstance() - Say the startup of the server fails, this will not initialize 'serverFactory' and will be null. When the flow comes to teardown/shutdown, it will bypass stopping of this server instance due to the following check. This will affect other test case verifications like, jmx check 'JMXEnv#ensureOnly'.  

ClientBase#shutdownServerInstance

    static void shutdownServerInstance(ServerCnxnFactory factory,
            String hostPort)
    {
        if (factory != null) {
           //...shutdown logic
        }
