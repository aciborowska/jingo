Improves the following items in zkpython which are related to the Zookeeper synchronous API:


	For pyzoo_create, no longer limit the returned znode name to 256 bytes; dynamically allocate memory on the heap.
	For all the synchronous api calls, release the Python Global Interpreter Lock just before doing the synchronous call.



I will attach the patch shortly.
