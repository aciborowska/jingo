I am seeing that the /var/log/zookeeper/zookeeper.out file is getting filled up faster than usual. It has grown upto 5 GB. When I further saw the out file, lot of them are [INFO] as follows:

2016-03-22 02:03:42,621 - INFO  [ProcessThread(sid:4 cport:-1)::PrepRequestProcessor@645] - Got user-level KeeperException when processing sessionid:0x4534413d1f70001 type:create cxid:0x71e0aa99 zxid:0x5f00e3de69 txntype:-1 reqpath:n/a Error Path:null Error:KeeperErrorCode = NoAuth

The log4j properties file was modified to change the parameter for logging from INFO, CONSOLE to INFO, ROLLINGFILE. But I would like to understand where the above INFO is coming from.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks
