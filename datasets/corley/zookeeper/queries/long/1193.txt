ZOOKEEPER-5 introduced the upgrade feature in october 2008. It may be time to think whether there are still installations in the wild that needs this upgrade feature. Otherwise the respective code can be removed.

Even if there should be old installations, couldn't they just use some ZK 3.x version to upgrade and we could still remove the upgrade code from the trunk?
