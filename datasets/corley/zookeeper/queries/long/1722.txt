We should be able to expose a few more API calls that allow user write unit tests that cover various failure scenarios (similar to the TestableZookeer in zookeeper test). This should also minimize the effort on setting the test framework for application developer

Here is some example calls that we should provide.
1. zookeeper_close() that don't actually send close request to the server:     This can be used to simulate a client crash without actually crashing the test program.
2. Allow client to trigger CONNECTION_LOSS or SESSSION_EXPIRE event: This will allow the user to test their watchers and callback (and possible race condition)
