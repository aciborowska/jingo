GetChildren() is the only non-create/delete API which does not include the node stat information. I propose that the definition of GetChildren() should be:

    class GetChildrenResponse 
{
        vector<ustring> children;
        org.apache.zookeeper.data.Stat stat;
    }

There is a trivial fix to the server (FinalRequestProcessor.java): rsp = new GetChildrenResponse(children, stat);

And something similar to the  client library.
