For each connection, a ConnectionBean will be created to represent this connection at finishSessionInit:



 ...


 jmxConnectionBean = new ConnectionBean(this, zk);


 MBeanRegistry.getInstance().register(jmxConnectionBean, zk.jmxServerBean);


 ...


 ObjectName oname = makeObjectName(path, bean);


 ...


  return new ObjectName(beanName.toString());


 ...


 _canonicalName = (new String(canonical_chars, 0, prop_index)).intern();





So, for every connection, it takes dozens of bytes at permgen. With connection established constantly, the usage of permgen will increase continuously.

Is it reasonable or necessary to manage each connection with ConnectionBean?
