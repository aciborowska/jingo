I have been having a problem with zookeeper 3.0.1 and now with 3.1.0 where I see a lot of expired sessions.  I am using a 16 node cluster which is all on the same local network.  There is a single zookeeper instance (these are benchmarking runs).
The problem appears to be correlated with either run time or system load.\

Personally I think that it is system load because I have session session expired events under a Windows platform running zookeeper and the application (i.e., everthing is local) when the application load suddenly spikes.  To me this suggests that the client is not able to renew (ping) the zookeeper service in a timely manner and is expired.  But the log messages below with the "read error" suggest that maybe there is something else going on?
