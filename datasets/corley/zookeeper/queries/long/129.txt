This is a basic server that acts as a proxy between a thrift interface and ZooKeeper. It doesn't support watches, and I'm not entirely convinced the session handling makes sense, but it works for basic operations like creating, listing and deleting nodes. The patch puts the code and (basic) build file under src/contrib/thrift; the build file requires the thrift compiler to be in the path, and the thrift and zookeeper libraries in the lib dir.
