Access to shuttingDownLE in QuorumPeer is not synchronized here:

https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/3c37184e83a3e68b73544cebccf9388eea26f523/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/QuorumPeer.java#L1066
https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/3c37184e83a3e68b73544cebccf9388eea26f523/src/java/main/org/

The access should be synchronized as the same variable might be accessed 
in QuormPeer::restartLeaderElection, which is synchronized.
