While working on the release of 3.4.12 and testing under jdk 6 I noticed that our javadoc task currently fails due to the yetus api compatability annotations we have. The yetus annotations target jdk 7.

While I don't think this is too much of a problem since it should not impact ZooKeeper operation under jdk 6 we should definitely avoid silent failures.
