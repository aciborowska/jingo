There are a couple of deserialization methods that all receive a new DataTree instance as parameter forwarding this instance in a row until the last in the row populates this instance. While this pattern is derived from jute there's no reason not to instantiate a new DataTree object in the last deserialization method and returning it through the stack. That makes it easier to reason about the code because it then is obvious that the DataTree instance worked on is indeed a new instance.
