Ability to support more digits in the version string.
Zookeeper, now expects the version sting to be of X.Y.Z-# format.
With this change, the default behavior is still the same X.Y.Z-# and will not break any existing things.
But at the same time, allows people to tag on their own digits to the version strings, so that they can add a patch or two in their own environments and be able to distinguish between apache zookeeper version and locally modified zookeeper version.
