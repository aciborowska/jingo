Given a zookeeper path and knowing it was created with the SEQUENCE flag, it would be nice to be able to get the sequence number and the name.  Currently, it is not documented how many bytes the sequence number uses in the path (Mahadev told me 10 for 3.1.1 for example), and having a function to retrieve this data would hide the actual number of bytes used and provide the useful functionality for users.
