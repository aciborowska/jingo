we currently have our own asynchronous NIO socket engine to be able to handle lots of clients with a single thread. over time the engine has become more complicated. we would also like the engine to use multiple threads on machines with lots of cores. plus, we would like to be able to support things like SSL. if we switch to netty, we can simplify our code and get the previously mentioned benefits.
