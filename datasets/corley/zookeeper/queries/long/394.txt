TestNG is a powerful test harness, which provides a lot of useful features like parallel test execution, test parametrization, and such.
ZooKeeper uses JUnit (v.4.4) environment instead which certainly should help to ease the conversion

I'd suggest to convert ZooKeeper's Junit based test infrastructure into TestNG controller environment, which will allow to achieve higher level of test execution control in the long run. 

The same conversion has been already performed for Avro project (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-26)
