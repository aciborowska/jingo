the package name of c client is "c-client-src",
which lead the include file to be installed to /usr/local/include/c-client-src.

it's a bit annoying since user need to manual rename it to zookeeper.

i think there are two fix,
1) change autoconf package name to "zookeeper", then the header will be installed to
   zookeeper subdir, which is consistent with the README;
2) change pkginclude_HEADER to include_HEADER, which will install headers to /usr/local/include.
