The org.apache.zookeeper.test.QuorumBase class imports the com.sun.management.UnixOperatingSystemMXBean class, that fail to build when using IBM Java 6 SR 11.  This issue is resolved by new class OSMXBean class proposed in JIRA's 1474.

The class OSMXBean (org.apache.zookeeper.server.util.OSMXBean) is a wrapper for the implementation of com.sun.management.UnixOperatingSystemMXBean, and decides to use the SUN API or its own implementation depending on the runtime (vendor) used.
