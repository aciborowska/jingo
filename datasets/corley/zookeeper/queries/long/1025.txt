Here's an example: 

I do an ls to get znode names. I try to stat a znode.  

[zk: localhost:3181(CONNECTED) 1] ls /flume-nodes
[nodes0000000002, nodes0000000001, nodes0000000000, nodes0000000005, nodes0000000004, nodes0000000003]
[zk: localhost:3181(CONNECTED) 3] stat /flume-nodes/nodes0000000002 
cZxid = 0xb
ctime = Sun Mar 20 23:24:03 PDT 2011
... (success)



Here's something that almost looks the same.  Notice the extra space infront of the znode name.


[zk: localhost:3181(CONNECTED) 2] stat  /flume-nodes/nodes0000000002
Command failed: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Path length must be > 0



This seems like unexpected behavior.
