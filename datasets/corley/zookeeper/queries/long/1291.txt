It is possible that a leader proposes an epoch e and a follower adopts it by setting acceptedEpoch to e but the leader itself hasn't yet done so. 

While I'm not sure this contradicts Zab (there is no description of where the leader actually sets its acceptedEpoch), it is very counter intuitive.

The fix is to set acceptedEpoch in getEpochToPropose, i.e., before anyone LearnerHandler passes the getEpochToPropose barrier.

The fix is done as part of ZK-1264
