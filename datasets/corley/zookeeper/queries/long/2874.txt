While not apparent when building ZooKeeper stand-alone, further testing when linking with Mesos revealed it was ZooKeeper that was causing the warning:


LIBCMTD.lib(initializers.obj) : warning LNK4098: defaultlib 'libcmt.lib' conflicts with use of other libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library [C:\Users\andschwa\src\mesos\build\src\slave\mesos-agent.vcxproj]



As Mesos is linking with /MTd in Debug configuration (which is the most common practice).

Once I found the source of the warning, the fix is trivial and I am posting a patch.
