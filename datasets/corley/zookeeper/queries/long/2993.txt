There are Rcc.java and other required files under the src/java/main/org/apache/jute/compiler/generated directory.

However, when I tried to add the source distribution to our own git repo, the .gitignore file has "generated" as a key word in line 55 - which prevents the dir and files under that dir to be added to the repo.  The compilation later fails due to the missing dir and files.

Fix is to remove or comment out the generated key word in line 55.
