It's not very obvious in the docs that the operator of the zk server is responsible for managing the files in the datadir:

http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/r3.0.0/zookeeperAdmin.html#File+Management

specifically removing the old snaps/transactionallogs

we need to make this more obvious, perhaps call it out in the quickstart (note pointing to this document)

Perhaps we should include example script and cron as well (docs)
