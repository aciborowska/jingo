Let us suppose zookeeper cluster is running in the following machines


server.1=10.18.52.133:2999:3999
server.2=10.18.52.253:2999:3999
server.3=10.18.52.96:2999:3999




Let us take another zookeeper(10.18.52.109),which is not part of the cluster configuration, tries to participate in the leader election,then one of the zookeeper server's log is filled with following INFO messages


2011-04-19 17:42:42,457 - INFO  [/10.18.52.133:3999:QuorumCnxManager$Listener@486] - Received connection request /10.18.52.109:18324
