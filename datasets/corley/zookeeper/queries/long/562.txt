The c client can flood the server with pings if the tcp queue is filled.

Say the cluster is overloaded and shuts down the recv processing

a c client can send a ping, but since last_send is only updated on successful pushing of data into the 
socket, if flush_send_queue fails to send any data (send_buffer returns 0) then last_send is not updated
and zookeeper_interest will again send a ping the next time it is woken - which could be 0 if recv_to is close
to 0, easily could happen if server is not sending data to the client.
