Today SASLAuthenticationProvider is used for all SASL based authentications which creates some "if/else" statements in ZookeeperSaslClient and ZookeeperSaslServer code with just Kerberos and Digest.

We want to use yet another different SASL based authentication and adding one more "if/else" with some code specific just to that new way does not make much sense.

Proposal is to allow to plug custom SASL Authentication mechanism(s) without  further changes in Zookeeper code.
