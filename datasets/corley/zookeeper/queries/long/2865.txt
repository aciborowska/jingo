When we run our Distributed system Model Checking (DMCK) in ZooKeeper v3.5.3
by following the workload in ZK-2778:

	initially start 2 ZooKeeper nodes
	start 3 new nodes
	do a reconfiguration (the complete reconfiguration is attached in the document)



We think our DMCK found this following bug:

	while one of the just joined nodes has not received the latest configuration update
(called as node X), the initial leader node closed its port, 
therefore causing the node X to be isolated.



For complete information of the bug, please see the document that is attached.
