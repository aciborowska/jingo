I downloaded the zookeeper-3.5.3-beta.tar.gz file from several mirror sites and all of them are corrupted.

$ wget http://www-us.apache.org/dist/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.5.3-beta/zookeeper-3.5.3-beta.tar.gz
$:~/dockerfiles$ tar -xzvf zookeeper-3.5.3-beta.tar.gz

gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
tar: Child returned status 1
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now

If this is my mistake, please could you explain me what I did wrong?
