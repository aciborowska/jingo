We noticed that one of the follower fail to restart due to missing parent node

We believed that the root cause is due to bugs in follower sync-up logic. Due to race condition, the follower may miss some proposals. The log below show that the follower see the commit message but it haven't seen this proposal before

I can reproduce this by keep running FollowerResyncConcurrencyTest until failure occurs. I suspected that the root caused is due to how we handle toBeApplied and outstandingProposals in the leader. 

1. In-flight proposals is removed from outstandingProposal before it is added to toBeApplied. Most of the problem I seen so far seem to caused by this gap.
2. startForwarding() iterate through outstandingProposal without locking PrepRequestProcessor properly, so there is possibility of missing in-flight proposal.
