Discussing 209 with Ben today, we thought that it would be better to have the parse method of QuorumPeerConfig returning a boolean that indicates whether the configuration is good or not, and let the caller decide whether to exit or not. Currently we execute a System.exit() on QuorumPeerConfig.parse when we have a critical configuration error.
