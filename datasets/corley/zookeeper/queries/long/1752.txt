The download area under http://www.apache.org/dist/zookeeper/ contains several superseded releases.

It is important that only the latest release of each currently maintained product line is stored on the main ASF mirrors. Links to older releases can be provided on download pages, but the links should be to the ASF archive server http://archive.apache.org/dist/zookeeper/
