ZOOKEEPER-1549 discusses the problem:

"When the leader started, it will apply every txn in its txnlog (incl. uncommitted ones) into its in-memory data tree"

I didn't any solution so far solved this problem in 3.5.x. Since this affects only TRUNC part â€“ only old leader that needs TRUNC applies uncommitted txns, a simple fix would be change current TRUNC logic to SNAP. This isn't hard to implement, but guarantees safety.

Ideally, we will solve the whole problem by untangling all compatibility issues and fixing the protocol.
