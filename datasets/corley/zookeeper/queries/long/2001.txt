org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerConfig has the following two methods.
1.public void parse(String path) throws ConfigException
2. public void parseProperties(Properties zkProp)
It would be great if you could please add a wrapper to take an input stream. In the first method, half way through it becomes a file input stream. So I assume its fairly easy to add this wrapper. The reason is most applications will be getting a stream with the classloader help.
