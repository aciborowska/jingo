RPM package init.d startup script is not relocatable, and there is some bugs in contrib directory build structure where property is not passed from main project to contrib, hence some of the contrib projects generate ${dist.dir} directory instead of building in the top level build directory.  The usage of BUILD directory is not exactly correct from ZOOKEEPER-1210.  RPM build procedure should use BUILDROOT as install destination to properly support RPM 4.6+ while package is building.
