Before the call to zk.getZKDatabase().deserializeSnapshot in Learner.java, 
zk.getZKDatabase().getDataTree().getNode("/zookeeper") == zk.getZKDatabase().getDataTree().procDataNode, which means that this is the same znode, as it should be. 

However, after this call, they are not equal. The node actually being used in client operations is zk.getZKDatabase().getDataTree().getNode("/zookeeper"), but the other old node procDataNode is still there and not replaced (in fact it is a final field).
