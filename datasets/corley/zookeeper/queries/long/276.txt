BookKeeper is a system to reliably log streams of records. In BookKeeper, servers are "bookies", log streams are "ledgers", and each unit of a log (aka record) is a "ledger entry". BookKeeper is designed to be reliable; bookies, the servers that store ledgers can be byzantine, which means that some subset of the bookies can fail, corrupt data, discard data, but as long as there are enough correctly behaving servers the service as a whole behaves correctly; the meta data for BookKeeper is stored in ZooKeeper.
