Infra is phasing out the current mechanism we use to deploy maven artifacts. We need to move to repository.apache.org (nexus).

In particular we need to ensure the following artifacts get published:

	zookeeper-3.x.y.jar
	zookeeper-3.x.y-sources.jar
	zookeeper-3.x.y-tests.jar
	zookeeper-3.x.y-javadoc.jar



In 3.4.4/3.4.5 we missed the tests jar which caused headaches for downstream users, such as Hadoop.
