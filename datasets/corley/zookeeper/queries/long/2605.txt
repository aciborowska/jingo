Not sure if it's a bug, or just a consequence of a design decision.

Recently we had an issue where faulty clients were issuing create requests at an abnormally high rate, which caused zookeeper to generate more snapshots than our cron job could clean up. This filled up the disk on our zookeeper hosts and brought the cluster down.

Is there a reason why Zookeeper uses a write-ahead log instead only flushing successful transactions to disk? If only successful transactions are flushed and counted towards snapCount, then even if a client is spamming requests to create a node that already exists, it wouldn't cause a flood of snapshots to be persisted to disk.
