	Use ArrayDeque instead of LinkedList
	Use ThreadLocalRandom instead of Random
	Remove the 'running' flag - use the Thread#join facility to detect if the thread has stopped running.  Using a flag can cause race condition issues and is superfluous.
	Make static final variable names in all caps
	General cleanup





This class is likely to be faster than Stack when used as a stack, and faster than LinkedList when used as a queue.
