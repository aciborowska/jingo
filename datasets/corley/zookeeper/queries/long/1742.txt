There are two problems I have spotted when running "make check" with the C client. First, it complains that the sleep call is not defined in two test files: tests/ZooKeeperQuorumServer.cc and tests/TestReconfigServer.cc. Including unistd.h works. The second problem is with linker options. It complains that "--wrap" is not a valid. I'm not sure how to deal with this one yet, since I'm not sure why we are using it.
