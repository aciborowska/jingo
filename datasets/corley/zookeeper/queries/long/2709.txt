We recently found up in HBASE-17717 that we were incorrectly setting an ACL on our "sensitive" znodes after the output of getACL on these nodes didn't match what was expected.

In referencing the documentation about how the auth ACL scheme was supposed to work, it was unclear if it was a ZooKeeper bug or an HBase bug. After reading some ZooKeeper code, we found that it was an HBase bug, but it would be nice to clarify the docs around this ACL scheme.
