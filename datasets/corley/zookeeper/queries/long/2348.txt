When client session expired, leader tried to remove it from session map and remove its EPHEMERAL znode, for example, /test_znode. This operation succeed on leader, but at the very same time, network fault happended and not synced to followers, a new leader election launched. After leader election finished, the new leader is not the old leader. we found the znode /test_znode still existed in the followers but not on leader

 Scenario : 
1) Create znode E.g.  
/rmstore/ZKRMStateRoot/RMAppRoot/application_1449644945944_0001/appattempt_1449644945944_0001_000001
2) Delete Znode. 
3) Network fault b/w follower and leader machines
4) leader election again and follower became leader.

Now data is not synced with new leader..After this client is not able to same znode.
