The Hedwig Server is connected to ZooKeeper.  In the ZkTopicManager, it registers a watcher so that if it ever gets disconnected from ZK, it will temporarily fail all incoming requests since the Hedwig server does not know for sure if it is still the master for the topics.  When the ZK client gets reconnected, the logic currently is wrong and it does not unset the suspended flag.  Thus once it gets disconnected, it will stay in the suspended state forever, thereby making the Hedwig server hub dead.
