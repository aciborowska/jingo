I suspect it's very common for deployments to have a wide variety of client libraries (different versions/languages) connecting to a given cluster.

It would be handy to have a way to identify clients via a clientID (akin to HTTP's User-Agent header). This could be implemented in ZooKeeperServer#processConnectRequest [1] and be fully backwards compatible.

The clientID could then be kept with the corresponding ServerCnxn instance and be used for better logging (or stats expose through 4-letter commands). 

The corresponding client side change would be to expose API to set the clientID on each connection handler (and by default it could be something like "zk java $version", "zk c $version", etc).

Thoughts?
