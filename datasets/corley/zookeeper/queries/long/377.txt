Giri, can you take a look at this?

I ran "ant test"

looks like this test failed:
     [exec] Zookeeper_operations::testOperationsAndDisconnectConcurrently1 : assertion

then later...

     [exec] 
     [exec] /home/phunt/dev/workspace/svnzk_apache/src/c/tests/TestOperations.cc:551: Assertion: equality assertion failed [Expected: -4, Actual  : 0, ZCONNECTIONLOSS != rc]
     [exec] Failures !!!
     [exec] Run: 38   Failure total: 1   Failures: 1   Errors: 0
     [exec] make: *** [run-check] Error 1
