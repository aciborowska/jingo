As we began to discuss in ZOOKEEPER-1366, it would be great to have the ability to mock out time methods anywhere to help with deterministic, more efficient testing. 

The general idea is to have a 'mock clock' that any thread can interact with as though it were the real clock. Time would typically be advanced by an independent thread of control (normally the thread that the test is running in). 

There are two main method calls that interact with the JVM clock:


	System.currentTimeMillis - very easy to mock
	Thread.sleep - slightly harder, since the mock clock would need to keep an ordered list of threads that need to be woken up and release a barrier for each one as time was advanced.



Other implicit methods, such as setting the socket rx timeout, are probably too hard to mock and are out of scope for this ticket.
