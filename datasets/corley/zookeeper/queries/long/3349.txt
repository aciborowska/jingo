QuorumCnxManager member variable 'socketTimeout' is not used anywhere in the class. It's clear from the context that it should either be removed entirely or invoked in QuorumCnxManager::setSockOpts. Since the QuorumPeer syncLimit can be changed by jmx, I'm thinking that the former is the better solution.
