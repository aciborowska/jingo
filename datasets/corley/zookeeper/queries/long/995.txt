When creating a new node while using a chrooted connection the client function returns the full path (no chroot prefix). I've encountered this while using zkpython and that's why I suppose it's a problem related to the C bindings. It seems like the java client it's not affected by the same issue (only tested using the command line interface). I will also attach a patch with failing test.
