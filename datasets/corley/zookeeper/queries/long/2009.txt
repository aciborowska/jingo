In 3.4.5, zkCli executed commands passed on the command line. This command would create the /test znode and exit, with a non-zero exit code if the command failed:


$ ./zkCli.sh create /test null



This is no longer the case in 3.4.6 - the command is not executed, but zkCli still runs & exits with a zero exit code.

The interim workaround in bash is to use here documents:


$ ./zkCli.sh <<EOF
create /test null
EOF
