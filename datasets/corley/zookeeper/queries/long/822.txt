Created a 3 node cluster.

1 Fail the ZK leader
2. Let leader election finish. Restart the leader and let it join the 
3. Repeat 

After a few rounds leader election takes anywhere 25- 60 seconds to finish. Note- we didn't have any ZK clients and no new znodes were created.

zoo.cfg is shown below:

#Mon Jul 19 12:15:10 UTC 2010
server.1=192.168.4.12\:2888\:3888
server.0=192.168.4.11\:2888\:3888
clientPort=2181
dataDir=/var/zookeeper
syncLimit=2
server.2=192.168.4.13\:2888\:3888
initLimit=5
tickTime=2000

I have attached logs from two nodes that took a long time to form the cluster after failing the leader. The leader was down anyways so logs from that node shouldn't matter.
Look for "START HERE". Logs after that point should be of our interest.
