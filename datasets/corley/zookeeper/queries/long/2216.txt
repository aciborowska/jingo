I am logging this  as part of a feature request.
We use Zookeeper - pretty extensively. 
Thanks for putting a pretty awesome product! 

This is a feature request.
As of now, there is no way to ask Zookeeper to get the whole property hierarchy as a whole tree in a single call.
We would be grateful if you guys can give this facility to get the whole property tree as a whole. 

NOTE: I personally won't mind coding this, if you guys permit me.
