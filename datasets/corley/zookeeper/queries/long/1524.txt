The following tests:

AuthTest.java
SaslAuthFailTest.java
SaslAuthDesignatedClientTest.java
SaslAuthFailDesignatedClientTest.java
SaslAuthMissingClientConfigTest.java
SaslAuthTest.java

use "static 
{..}
" blocks to initialize system properties and files prior to the test runs. As Patrick points out in ZOOKEEPER-1503, we should instead use JUnit's @Before annotation:


http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/Before.html

rather than static blocks, to make our tests more consistent and easier to understand.
