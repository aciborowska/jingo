More important zookeeper warnings are drown out by the following several times per minute:

2010-01-12 17:39:57,227:22317(0x4147eb90):ZOO_WARN@zookeeper_interest@1335: Exceeded deadline by 13ms

Perhaps this is an issue with the way virtualized systems manage gettimeofday results?

Maybe the current 10ms threshold could be pushed up a bit.  I notice that 95% of the messages are below 50ms.

Is there an obvious configuration change that I can make to fix this?

config file below:


	The number of milliseconds of each tick
tickTime=2000
	The number of ticks that the initial
	synchronization phase can take
initLimit=10
	The number of ticks that can pass between
	sending a request and getting an acknowledgement
syncLimit=5
	the directory where the snapshot is stored.
dataDir=/mnt/zookeeper
	the port at which the clients will connect
clientPort=2181
