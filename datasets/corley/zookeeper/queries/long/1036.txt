1. current process
when leader fail, a new leader will be elected, followers will sync with the
new leader.
After synced, leader send UPTODATE to follower.

2. a corner case
but there is a corner case, things will go wrong.
suppose message M only exists on leader, after a follower synced with
leader, the client connected to the follower will see M.
but it only exists on two servers, not on a quorum of servers. If the new
leader and the follower failed, message M is lost, but M is already seen by
client.

3. one solution
So I think UPTODATE  can be sent to follower only when a quorum of server
synced with the leader.
