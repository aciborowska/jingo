If you have quotas properly set for a given path, i.e.:


create /zookeeper/quota/test/zookeeper_limits 'count=1,bytes=100'
create /zookeeper/quota/test/zookeeper_stats 'count=1,bytes=100'



and then you update the limits znode with bogus data, i.e.:


set /zookeeper/quota/test/zookeeper_limits ''



you'll crash the cluster because IllegalArgumentException isn't handled when dealing with quotas znodes:

https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/ZOOKEEPER-823/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/DataTree.java#L425

We should handle IllegalArgumentException. Optionally, we should also throw BadArgumentsException from PrepRequestProcessor.
