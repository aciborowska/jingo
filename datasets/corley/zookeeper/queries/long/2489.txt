Jetty was added as one of dependencies in ZOOKEEPER-1346 in 2011, and have not been updated since then. The version we are using in trunk is 6.1.26 which was released in 2010. We should consider upgrade Jetty to a recent stable release version (probably one of the 9.x.).

Note: this JIRA issue is recreated from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2427, which was deleted a couple of weeks ago as part of Apache Infrastructure spam fighting effort.
