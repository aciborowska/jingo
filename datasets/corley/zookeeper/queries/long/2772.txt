I set the acl to not be able to delete a node - but was able to delete regardless.

I am not familiar with the code, but a reply from Martin in the user@ mailing list seems to confirm the issue.  I will paste his response below - sorry for the long listing.

Subject: Acl block detete not working

Hi,
I'm using 3.4.10 and setting custom aol to block deletion of a znode.  However, I'm able to delete the node even after I've set acl from cdrwa to cra.

Can anyone point out if I missed some step.

Thanks for the help

Here is the trace:

MG>in SetAclCommand you can see the acl being parsed and acl being set by setAcl into zk object

    List<ACL> acl = AclParser.parse(aclStr);
        int version;
        if (cl.hasOption("v")) 
{
            version = Integer.parseInt(cl.getOptionValue("v"));
        } else {
            version = -1;
        }
        try {
            Stat stat = zk.setACL(path, acl, version);

MG>later on in DeleteCommand there is no check for aforementioned acl parameter
  public boolean exec() throws KeeperException, InterruptedException {
        String path = args[1];
        int version;
        if (cl.hasOption("v")) {            version = Integer.parseInt(cl.getOptionValue("v"));        }
 else 
{
            version = -1;
        }

        try 
{
        zk.delete(path, version);
        }
 catch(KeeperException.BadVersionException ex) 
{
            err.println(ex.getMessage());
        }
        return false;

MG>as seen here the testCase works properly saving the Zookeeper object
    LsCommand entity = new LsCommand();
        entity.setZk(zk);


MG>but setACL does not save the zookeeper object anywhere but instead seems to discard zookeeper object with accompanying ACLs

MG>can you report this bug to Zookeeper?
