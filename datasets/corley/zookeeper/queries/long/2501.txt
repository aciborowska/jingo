This jira is to address Flavio Junqueira's comment.


ZooKeeperCriticalThread#handleException() logs an error message including a throwable. Again, in ZooKeeperServerListenerImpl#notifyStopping(), it logs an info message with the exit code. Here it is better to consolidate the logging and have only a log error message here in this #notifyStopping method. We would need to change the signature and pass a throwable, though.
