as written in the contrib/zkpython/README file:


"Python >= 2.6 is required. We have tested against 2.6. We have not tested against 3.x."

this is probably more a 'new feature' request than a bug; anyway compiling the pythn module and calling it returns an error at load time:


python3.1
Python 3.1.2 (r312:79147, May  8 2010, 16:36:46) 
[GCC 4.4.4] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import zookeeper
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: /usr/local/lib/python3.1/dist-packages/zookeeper.so: undefined symbol: PyString_AsString



are there any plan to support Python3.X?

I also tried to write a 3.1 ctypes wrapper but the C API seems in fact to be written in C++, so python ctypes cannot be used.
