 I  deploy ZooKeeper in a cluster of three nodes on three different linux machines.
All is going well,but I got the output of " Error contacting service. It is probably not running " when I executed "zkServer.sh status" to check  if the node of cluster was running.
Finally, I found a problem in zkServer.sh 
it got "clientPort=2181" when executing "zkServer.sh status" ,but the correct String is only "2181".So, It is a solution to the problem that removing "clientPort=" from  "clientPort=2181" .

I hope you understand me. My poor English.
