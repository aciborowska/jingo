This Jira in intended to be the successor of ZOOKEEPER-2939.

By using dropwizard library's Histogram component we'll be able to provide more sophisticated statistics on Proposal sizes.

From the docs:
"A histogram measures the statistical distribution of values in a stream of data. In addition to minimum, maximum, mean, etc., it also measures median, 75th, 90th, 95th, 98th, 99th, and 99.9th percentiles."
