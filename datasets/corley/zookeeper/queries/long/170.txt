We need the content which describes how to a client should read data from a zookeeper node. Ideally this would have pseudo code describing any lead-up (for example resource allocation, etc),  a few lines of sample code in Java, and a few parallel lines in C. 

Any commentary would be highly appreciated â€“ anything about reading data that would not be obvious to a new ZooKeeper developer.
