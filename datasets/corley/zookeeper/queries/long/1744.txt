When "clientPortAddress" is used in the config file (zoo.cfg), zkServer.sh's status command runs a grep command that matches both "clientPort" and "clientPortAddress".  This creates an extra argument for FourLetterWordMain, which fails, so the status command incorrectly indicates that it couldn't connect to the server.

Also, "localhost" is hardcoded as the target host for FourLetterWordMain.  The "clientPortAddress" should be used if it is provided in the config file.
