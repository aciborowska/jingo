After the directory structures has been created, it is time to create the pom files for all the modules, and create the build hierarchy. 
At first, ant should remain in place until we are sure maven works fine.

After maven build is stable for jute, server, client and common recipes and contrib should be finished as well.

The different modules will get their maven structure:

zookeeper-[something]
| -src
|    | -main
|    |    | -java
|    |    |     \org...
|    |    \resources
|    | -test (unit tests only)
|    |    | -java
|    |    |   \org...
|    |    \ resources
|    | - it (integration tests)
|    \pom.xml
