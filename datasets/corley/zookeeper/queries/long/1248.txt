I'm trying to understand the purpose of the exception field in request. This isn't made easier by the fact that the multi case in PrepRequestProcessor sets the exception without reason.

The only code that calls request.getException() is in FinalRequestProcessor and this code only acts when the operation is not a multi operation.
