Note: the javadoc is wrong here:

    /**

	Returns the last entry identifier submitted and increments it.
	@return long
     */
    long setLast(long last){



also would be great to have javadoc for the legerrecoverymonitor getNextHint method. I was reviewing this code and it would have been helpful to know what to expect of this method. (possible return values, etc...)
