When Kerberos is used as authentication mechanism some time TGT is getting expired because it is not refreshed timely.
The scenario is as follow:
suppose now=8 (the current milliseconds)
next refresh time= 10
TGT expire time= 9

Current behaviour: Error is logged and TGT refresh thread exits.
Expected behaviour: TGT should be refreshed immediately(now) instead of nextRefreshTime
