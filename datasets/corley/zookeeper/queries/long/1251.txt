There are 6 locations that call checkSession. This can be reduced to one location and makes it also much clearer in which cases checkSession is called or not called.

Note that in case that now the SessionMoved|Expired error is checked first before the check for a Marshalling error. However it shouldn't matter which error gets reported.
