We convert paths and authentication information to strings rather than byte[] even though we could work just as well with byte[] for our needs since we don't really interpret the strings. we are just doing basic pattern matching. the only really string manipulations we do with paths is to look for '/', but we could easily to that with byte[] since we use utf8 encoding for the strings. by not materializing the strings we save time doing the serializations and also space since most (almost all) of our strings are ASCII and thus just one byte.

we could probably get by without even changing the jute spec if we make the generated classes check for a flag to see whether strings should be treated as byte[] or String.
