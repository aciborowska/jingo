Caches built on top of zookeeper clients can become inconsistent because of lack of multi op watches. Our clients receive watch notifications for paths one at a time, and in their watch handling, invalidate the path in the cache. However, the cache now has an inconsistent view of zookeeper, since it is receiving the notifications one at a time. In general, the watch handling semantics do not conform with the idea of a multi op. If changes can be made to multiple paths atomically, all clients should be notified of that change atomically.
