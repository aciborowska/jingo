Relating to ZOOKEEPER-107 which has just added dynamic membership configuration, I'd like to propose a simplified one command weight shifting between datacenters.

This will allow for a globalized quorum where the primary datacenter in a follow the sun model gets highest weighting and can achieve low latency quorum without going over the wan. Therefore it's workload can be prioritized during it's business hours.

WANdisco has this capability which is used for it's globalized HDFS namespace control.

Obviously the current quorum majority DC must be accessible in order to initiate the quorum failover in such as scenario and the follow the sun nature of this idea also requires this to be scheduler friendly to automatically follow the sun and shift quorum majority voting several times in a 24-hour period. A single cronned zookeeper command on any zookeeper server should trigger the global coordination and handover of quorum majority to the designated DC.
