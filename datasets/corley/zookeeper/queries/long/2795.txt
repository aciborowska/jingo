We have an integration test suite that starts up an embedded version of zookeeper as part of a suite of services.

However because it doesn't register a shutdown handler, we get lots of warnings that look like this

17-05-30 15:04:56 achambers.local ERROR [org.apache.zookeeper.server.ZooKeeperServer:472] - ZKShutdownHandler is not registered, so ZooKeeper server won't take any action on ERROR or SHUTDOWN server state changes

My java is a bit rusty but I think I can't create one of these shutdown handlers from outside the "org.apache.zookeeper.server" package because the constructor has not been marked "public". Would it be possible to do so?
