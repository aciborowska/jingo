When clientPortAddress is not configured LocalPeerBean throws NullPointerException.

Expected Behavior:

	When only clientPort is configured ClientAddress value should be 0.0.0.0:clientPort or 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:clientPort
	When both clientPort clientPortAddress are configured then expected value is clientPortAddress:clientPort
