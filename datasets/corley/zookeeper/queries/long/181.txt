Some Source Forge Documents did not get moved over: 

javaExample
zookeeperTutorial
(These two I will move over directly)

zookeeperLogging
zookeeperAtomicBroadcast
(These two I will roll up into a new document: zookeeperInternals)

We can expand zookeeperInterals as new sections are needed, maybe one day morphing it into the "complete guide for zookeeper contributers"
