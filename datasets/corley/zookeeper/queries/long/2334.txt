The Zookeeper download page and mirrors only track the latest version of the mirror release versions.  The page has a link to the archives page at archive.apache.org, but that page is missing all releases after 3.3.2.  That means there are a large number of releases that disappear from the official download site when a new release is published.

In my particular case I was building a container based on 3.4.6.  Once 3.4.7 came out my build broke and it cannot be fixed as 3.4.7 can't be downloaded from anywhere official.
