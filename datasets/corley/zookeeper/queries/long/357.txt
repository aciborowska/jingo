Last week I setup an unattended ZooKeeper cluster that I expected to be able to take care of things while I was on vacation. I used 7 dedicated servers with two disks. I had done extensive burn in testing of the servers, so I fully expected the system to work problem free for the entire week. Indeed, when I returned yesterday none of the 7 servers had any hardware or software problem the entire time nor had there been any network problems. On the other hand the Zoo was in complete chaos. Even though there were no errors in the ZooKeeper log most of the animals were near starvation, except for the lions who had gotten loose and eaten some of the pigs. I'll not even go into the stench from the dirty cages!

Either the documentation needs to more clearly explain how to configure the server properly in the Zoo environment, or it should clearly state that ZooKeeper cannot take care of the Zoo out of the box!
