peerType remains as "observer" in zoo.cfg even though we change the node from observer to participant runtime

Steps to reproduce:-
1. Start zookeeper in cluster with one node as observer by configuring 
peerType=observer in zoo.cfg and server.2=10.18.219.50:2888:3888:observer;2181
2. Start the cluster
3. start a client and change the node from observer to participant, the configuration related to peertype remained same though other things like clientport got from zoo.cfg

>reconfig -remove 2 -add 2=10.18.219.50:2888:3888:participant;2181

We should either remove this parameter or update with correct node type at run time
