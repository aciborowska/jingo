in watchertest there are some event.poll calls that have 1milli timeouts

        e = localWatcher.events.poll(1, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

this is showing falure in some cases under hudson (I assume when it's under load from other tests running for other proj)

We should review the poll calls and verify adequate timeouts.
