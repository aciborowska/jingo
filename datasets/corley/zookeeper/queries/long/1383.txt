Quotas exist for size (node count and size in bytes); it would be useful to track and support quotas on update throughput (bytes per second) as well. This can be tracked on both a node/subtree level for quota support as well as on the server level for monitoring.

In addition, the existing quotas log a warning when they are exceeded but allow the transaction to proceed (soft quotas). It would also be useful to support a corresponding set of hard quota limits that fail the transaction.
