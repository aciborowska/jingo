I just downloaded ZooKeeper 3.4.7 (wouldn't let me put that version in the "Affects Version/s" field) and it doesn't work out of the box on Windows 7, which is brutal for folks who don't understand.

It complains that you don't have JAVA_HOME set right if you have it set to a path with spaces e.g. C:\program files\java\blah will fail.

All the following need quotes around and %VARIABLE% expansions to deal with potential spaces in the path:


	bin/zkCli.cmd
	bin/zkEnv.cmd
	bin/zkServer.cmd



Should be a trivial fix.

Definition of Done:
zkCli.cmd, zkEnv.cmd and zkServer.cm work out of the box on Windows 7.
