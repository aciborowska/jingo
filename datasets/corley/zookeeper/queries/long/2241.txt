In the Login.java code, if a TGT with a small expiration date (e.g. 5 minutes) is passed in, the refresh date is set at a value less than the MIN_TIME_BEFORE_RELOGIN, which is a minute by default. As a result, the condition in line 153 evaluates to true, setting nextRefresh to now. Then right after, in line 176, it checks the nextRefresh againt now, and will jump to line 186 and just exit (without throwing an exception), exiting the refresh thread.

Possible Solution: changing line 176 to 
if (now <= nextRefresh)
