As so far, `QuorumCnxManager#receiveConnection` cannot find out the same `SID` problem, then the Zookeeper cluster will start successfully. But the cluster is not health, and it will throw some problem like `not synchronized`. So, i thought we should add some limitations on code level for `SID` to find those configuration problem more early.
