The jdk7 test job on jenkins is failing intermittently with 


java.lang.NullPointerException
	at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Zab1_0Test.recursiveDelete(Zab1_0Test.java:917)
	at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Zab1_0Test.recursiveDelete(Zab1_0Test.java:918)
	at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Zab1_0Test.recursiveDelete(Zab1_0Test.java:918)

	at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Zab1_0Test.testUnnecessarySnap(Zab1_0Test.java:483)



Seems to not be handling the case where the file is deleted out from under. Also the recursive deletes should be at the very end of the finally I would think.
