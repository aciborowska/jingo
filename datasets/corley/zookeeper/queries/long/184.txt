Some compilation environments provide implicit inclusion of certain system headers.
But any way it's not a reason to exploit it in platform-independent projects.

TestHashtable.cc and LibCMocks.h from src/c/tests/ use those functions without including corresponding system headers.

Modern versions of GCC are very strict.
You cannot build the code like this with the help of GCC version 4.3.
