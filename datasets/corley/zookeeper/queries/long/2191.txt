ZOOKEEPER-2183 introduced usage of the threads attribute on the <junit> task call in build.xml to speed up test execution.  This attribute is only available since Ant 1.9.4.  However, we can continue to support older Ant versions by calling the <antversion> task and dispatching to a clone of our <junit> task call that doesn't use the threads attribute.  Users of older Ant versions will get the slower single-process test execution.
