When running "zkServer.sh start" I get these error messages:

====
$sudo sh  bin/zkServer.sh start
MX enabled by default
bin/zkServer.sh: 69: cygpath: not found
Using config: 
grep: : No such file or directory
Starting zookeeper ... 
STARTED
$ Invalid config, exiting abnormally
====

The "Invalid config..." text is output from the server which terminates immediately after this message has been printed.

The fix is easy:   Inside zkServer.sh change the line
====
if $cygwin
====

into

====
if [ -n "$cygwin" ]
====

This fixes the problem and makes the server run
