ZOOKEEPER-710 fixed the issue when the request is not a multi request. However, the multi request is handled a little bit differently as the code didn't throw the SESSIONMOVED exception. In addition, the exception is set in the request by the leader so it will be lost in the commit process and by the time the final processor sees it, it will be gone.
