The following constructor in QuorumPeer seems to be never used, starting at line 370 in my branch:

    /**
     * For backward compatibility purposes, we instantiate QuorumMaj by default.
     */

    public QuorumPeer(Map<Long, QuorumServer> quorumPeers, File dataDir,
            File dataLogDir, int electionType,
            long myid, int tickTime, int initLimit, int syncLimit,
            ServerCnxnFactory cnxnFactory) throws IOException {
        this(quorumPeers, dataDir, dataLogDir, electionType, myid, tickTime,
                initLimit, syncLimit, cnxnFactory,
                new QuorumMaj(countParticipants(quorumPeers)));
    }
