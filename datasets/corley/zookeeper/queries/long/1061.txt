The zkServer.sh script doesn't check properly to see if a previously started
server is still running.  If you call start twice, the second invocation
will over-write the PID file with a process that then fails due to port
occupancy.

This means that stop will subsequently fail.

Here is a reference that describes how init scripts should normally work:
