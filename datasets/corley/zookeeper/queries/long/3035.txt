I'm reading the source code, but I often can not understand the operation code mean in OpCode.java. For example , the sync operation code is 9, but I can't understand what does this mean, and the source code has nothing about the code description. Do we have some wiki or document abount operation code?


public interface OpCode {
        public final int notification = 0;

        public final int setACL = 7;

        public final int getChildren = 8;

        public final int sync = 9;

        public final int ping = 11;
    }
