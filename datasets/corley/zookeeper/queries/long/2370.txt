(My apology if this is not a bug.)

I'm trying to use a ZK client which has successfully authenticated with a secure ZK server using principal me/hostname@EXAMPLE.COM. However, the following simple commands failed:


[zk: hostname(CONNECTED) 0] create /zk-test "1"
Created /zk-test
[zk: hostname(CONNECTED) 1] setAcl /zk-test sasl:me/hostname@EXAMPLE.COM:cdrwa
cZxid = 0x3e3b
ctime = Mon Feb 22 23:10:36 PST 2016
mZxid = 0x3e3b
mtime = Mon Feb 22 23:10:36 PST 2016
pZxid = 0x3e3b
cversion = 0
dataVersion = 0
aclVersion = 1
ephemeralOwner = 0x0
dataLength = 3
numChildren = 0
[zk: hostname(CONNECTED) 2] getAcl /zk-test
'sasl,'me/hostname@EXAMPLE.COM
: cdrwa
[zk: hostname(CONNECTED) 3] ls /zk-test
Authentication is not valid : /zk-test
[zk: hostname(CONNECTED) 4] create /zk-test/c "2"
Authentication is not valid : /zk-test/c



I wonder what I did wrong here, or is this behavior intentional? how can I delete the znodes? Thanks.
