The documentation states that 


ZooKeeper logs transactions to a transaction
log. After snapCount transactions are written to a log
file a snapshot is started and a new transaction log
file is created. The default snapCount is
100,000.



However, in implementation, snapshotting is done when logCount is somwhere in (snapCount/2, snapCount+1], based on the limit set at runtime:  


        if (logCount > (snapCount / 2 + randRoll)) {
