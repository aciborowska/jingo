while creating node using command (random arguments like this).
create /  /./// or some wrong format it shows the message 
/./// does not have the form scheme:id:perm
with Exception in thread "main" org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$InvalidACLException: KeeperErrorCode=InvalidACL
.....

It should give the accurate message but it should not get closed or quit.
