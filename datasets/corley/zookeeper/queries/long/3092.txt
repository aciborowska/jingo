ZooKeeper should provide a pluggable metrics system such that various metrics can be collected and reported using different approaches that fit production monitoring / alert / debugging needs. 
Historically ZooKeeper provides four letter words and JMX which exposes certain stats / metrics but they are not very flexible in terms of programmatically accessing metrics and connecting metrics to different reporting systems.

There are other projects that's already doing this which can be used for reference, such as bookkeeper metrics service providers and hadoop metrics2.
