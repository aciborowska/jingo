Our use of zookeeper requires high scalability, and the underlying data set is small and changes infrequently. A persisted cache is ideal for solving scalability. We want to treat a restart as if it were a prolonged reconnect - that is, maintain the last known zxid and watch list. We would like to expose a new zookeeper_init_with_watches api that allows the zhandle to be initialized with the watch list and last known zxid. The change would reuse the current reconnect logic.
