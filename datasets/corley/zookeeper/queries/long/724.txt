Currently we have ad-hoc logging (log4j) of setup/teardown and test start/end. Without this information it's often difficult to determine
what's going on (major milestones) in the logs relative to the tests performed.

In junit 4.x "@Rule" annotations have been added that allow this to be done much more easily. This patch will add this.

In particular we can access the test name easily during setup/teardown and the test itself. Additionally we can log more information on
success/failure of each test.
