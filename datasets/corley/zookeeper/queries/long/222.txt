Noticed this issue during a debugging session â€“ it's difficult to read/compare the timestamps from the c client.

The C client timestamp should be formatted with the same format as the JAVA log timestamps.

Note: java uses ISO8601 timestamp formatting by default.

Perhaps we should just bit the bullet and move to log4c? Consider this option when addressing this issue.
