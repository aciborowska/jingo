It would be better to have one process that uses ZooKeeper for different things 
(managing a list of work, locking some unrelated locks elsewhere). So there are
components that do this work inside the same process. These components should 
get the same zookeeper-client reference chroot'ed for their needs.
So it'd be much better, if the ClientCnxn would not care about the chroot.
