The following code appears in QuorumTest.testFollowersStartAfterLeader( ):

for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
    try 
{
       zk.create("/test", "test".getBytes(), ZooDefs.Ids.OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE,
                 CreateMode.PERSISTENT);
       break;
     }
 catch(KeeperException.ConnectionLossException e) 
{
       Thread.sleep(1000);
     }
    // test fails if we still can't connect to the quorum after 30 seconds.
    Assert.fail("client could not connect to reestablished quorum: giving up after 30+ seconds.");
}

From the comment it looks like the intention was to try to reconnect 30 times and only then trigger the Assert, but that's not what this does.
After we fail to connect once and Thread.sleep is executed, Assert.fail will be executed without retrying create.
