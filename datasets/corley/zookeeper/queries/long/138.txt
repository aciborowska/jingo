if a single watcher (A) is registered on a single node for both a getdata and exists watch the second watch event may be lost:

1) getdata("node", A)
2) setdata("node"...)
3) exists("node", A)
4) delete("node"...)

if watch events for 2 is processed on the client (zookeeper.java, zkwatcher) after 3 completes then the zkwatcher process event method will clear the watch and the subsequent operation's (4) event will be ignored
