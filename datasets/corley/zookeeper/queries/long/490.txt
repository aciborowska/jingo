the javadoc for ZooKeeper constructor says:


	The client object will pick an arbitrary server and try to connect to it.
	If failed, it will try the next one in the list, until a connection is
	established, or all the servers have been tried.



the "or all server tried" phrase is misleading, it should indicate that we retry until success, con closed, or session expired. 

we also need ot mention that connection is async, that constructor returns immed and you need to look for connection event in watcher
