Currently, the leader is elected based on the length of its history. In heterogeneous settings, other processes can be better suited to serve as a leader, e.g., the process running on the node with best links to a majority. POLE (Performance Oriented Leader Election)  will  be a leader election implementation that takes into account multiple factors when selecting the leader.
