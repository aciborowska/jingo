The script "zkServer.sh" contains a pattern (POSIX "character class syntax") which is not supported by "grep" on Solaris (both versions 10 and 11).


ZOO_DATADIR="$(grep "^[[:space:]]*dataDir" "$ZOOCFG" | sed -e 's/.*=//')"



This results into the environment variable being set with an empty value, which later gives the following error : 


Starting zookeeper ... bin/zkServer.sh: line 114: /zookeeper_server.pid: Permission denied




The workaround is to simplify the pattern used by "grep" :


ZOO_DATADIR="$(grep "^dataDir" "$ZOOCFG" | sed -e 's/.*=//')"



The same pattern is also used in the "status" command, which fails to read the "clientPort", which results into the following error :

Error contacting service. It is probably not running.
