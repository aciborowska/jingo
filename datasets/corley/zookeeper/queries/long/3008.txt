Inspired by ZK-3006 , I develop a simple static analysis tool to find other Potential NPE like ZK-3006. This bug is found by this tool ,and I have carefully studied it.  But i am a newbie at here so i may be wrong, hope someone could confirm it and help me improve this tool.
Bug description:

callee :SecurityUtils#createSaslClient will return null while encounter exception


// code placeholder
catch (Exception e) {
  LOG.error("Exception while trying to create SASL client", e);
  return null;
}


but its caller has no null check just like:


// code placeholder
sc = SecurityUtils.createSaslClient();
if (sc.hasInitialResponse()) {
   responseToken = createSaslToken(new byte[0], sc, learnerLogin);
}


I think we should add null check in caller while callee return null
