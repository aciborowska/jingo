I don't understand why do we even need this code at first place.

if (remoteSid == QuorumPeer.OBSERVER_ID) 
{
               /*
                * Choose identifier at random. We need a value to identify
                * the connection.
                */

               remoteSid = observerCounter--;
               initializeMessageQueue(remoteSid);
               LOG.info("Setting arbitrary identifier to observer: " + remoteSid);
           }
Even if remove above code from  public Long readRemoteServerID(Socket sock) {} function the FLE will work correctly. Because when any other peer(PARTICIPANT) receive a notification from the observer, that peer won't consider his(observer) vote because of this check

 if(!self.getVotingView().containsKey(response.sid))

Hence there is no need of that code. Also bcoz to above code there is a possibility of creating redundant threads (SendWorker-ReceiveWorker) bcoz when same participant try to initiate connection with same peer we are doing (sid = observerCounter--. So the same observer getting different sid and hence corresponding thread would be crated which will be of no use.

Please let me know if i am correct.
