Using Bigtop or other RPM build for Zookeeper, there is a problem with using the hyphen '-' character in the version string:

[bigdata@bdvs1166 bigtop]$ gradle zookeeper-rpm
:buildSrc:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:buildSrc:compileGroovy UP-TO-DATE
:buildSrc:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:buildSrc:classes UP-TO-DATE
:buildSrc:jar UP-TO-DATE
:buildSrc:assemble UP-TO-DATE
:buildSrc:compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE
:buildSrc:compileTestGroovy UP-TO-DATE
:buildSrc:processTestResources UP-TO-DATE
:buildSrc:testClasses UP-TO-DATE
:buildSrc:test UP-TO-DATE
:buildSrc:check UP-TO-DATE
:buildSrc:build UP-TO-DATE
:zookeeper_vardefines

Also, according to the rpm-maven-plugin documentation:


version
The version number to use for the RPM package. By default, this is the project version. This value cannot contain a dash (-) due to contraints in the RPM file naming convention. Any specified value will be truncated at the first dash

release
The release number of the RPM.
Beginning with release 2.0-beta-2, this is an optional parameter. By default, the release will be generated from the modifier portion of the project version using the following rules:
If no modifier exists, the release will be 1.
If the modifier ends with SNAPSHOT, the timestamp (in UTC) of the build will be appended to end.
All instances of '-' in the modifier will be replaced with '_'.
If a modifier exists and does not end with SNAPSHOT, "_1" will be appended to end.




We should allow underscore '_' as part of the version string. e.g. 
3.4.6_abc_1
