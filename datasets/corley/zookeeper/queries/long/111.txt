About to submit a patch that significantly cleans up existing tests.

1) removed the need for "sleep" calls in the tests, instead I monitor the status of the server (using the client socket "stat" command) which provides a barrier to the client test operations. I use this barrier both when starting and ending the test.

2) also fixed a number of problems in the tests where the test itself was broken.

3) general cleanup and some refactoring to make it easier to write new tests, maintain old, and track down issues if the test does find a problem.
