Flavio please address the findbugs warnings in quorum and sub packages. See
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/view/ZooKeeper/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/308/violations/
for a list of issues or use ant's findbugs (or eclipse) to identify the issues.
In general we should try to fix these, but ignoring the warning (annotation) is ok if it includes comments to effect why, also has
 to be reviewed/approved.
