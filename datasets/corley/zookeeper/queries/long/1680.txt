While the API permits construction of a ZooKeeper client object with a given sessionId, the sessionId can never be used:

ClientCnxn line 850: long sessId = (seenRwServerBefore) ? sessionId : 0;

The only person who sets seenRwServerBefore is onConnected().

Therefore, it appears that passing a sessionId into a ZooKeeper constructor has no effect, as the ClientCnxn has never seen an RW server before, so it discards it anyway.
