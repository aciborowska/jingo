Hello,

When you try to restart zookeeper via service zookeepr restart it ends in state:

root@m1:/etc/systemd# service zookeeper status
‚óè zookeeper.service - LSB: Apache ZooKeeper server
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/zookeeper)
   Active: active (exited) since Mon 2016-09-26 10:38:47 UTC; 58s ago
  Process: 55495 ExecStop=/etc/init.d/zookeeper stop (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
  Process: 55504 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/zookeeper start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)



After that service zookeeper start won't work. Only way is to do service zookeeper stop and then start or service zookeepr --full-restart (which does basically the same).
