Inspired by ZK-3006 , I develop a simple static analysis tool to find other Potential NPE like ZK-3006.Due to that  i am a newbie here, some of them i am not sure whether they will truly cause NPE, anyway I still list them in here(format:caller,callee):

	StaticHostProvider#updateServerList,StaticHostProvider#getServerAtCurrentIndex
	DataTree#getACL,ReferenceCountedACLCache#convertLong
	ConnectionBean#toString,ConnectionBean#getSourceIP
	Leader#propose,SerializeUtils#serializeRequest



Hopefully someone can confirm them and help improve this tool
