The multi-version of getChildren function allows us to traverse a tree using fewer requests to the server. At the moment, the number of requests for traversal is the same as the number of nodes, however, this can be changed to only use up as many requests as the height of the tree.

Currently, listSubTreeBFS utility function used for the deleteAll command and this improvement makes it more robust, especially in high latency setups.
