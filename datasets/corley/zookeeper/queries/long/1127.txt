When we get a auth response, every time we process any auth_response, we call ALL the auth completions (might be registered by different add_auth_info calls). we should be calling only the one that the request came from? I guess we dont know for which request the response corresponds to? If the requests are processed in FIFO and response are got in order then may be we can figure out which add_auth info request the response corresponds to.

Also , we never remove entries from the auth_list

Also the logging is misleading. 
<code>
  1206     if (rc) 
{
   1207         LOG_ERROR(("Authentication scheme %s failed. Connection closed.",
   1208                    zh->auth_h.auth->scheme));
   1209     }
   1210     else {
   1211         LOG_INFO(("Authentication scheme %s succeeded", zh->auth_h.auth->scheme));
</code>
If there are multiple auth_info in the auth_list , we always print success/failure for ONLY the first one. So if I had two auths for scehmes, ABCD and EFGH and my auth scheme EFGH failed, the logs will still say ABCD failed
