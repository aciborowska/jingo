	Change source tarball name from
zookeeper-3.5.5-source-package.tar.gz 
to 
apache-zookeeper-3.5.5.tar.gz




	After unpacking the tarballs the top level dir should match the archive's name.




	missing api docs after mvn clean install and from binary package. Fix readme on this:
"Full documentation for this release can also be found in docs/index.html"
Perhaps we should have a general README and a binary specific readme?




	Correct "The release artifact contains the following jar files in
"dist-maven" directory" - no dist-maven dir anymore.




	Include license file for netty-all-4.1.29.Final.jar
