Description
Although ZooKeeper is primarily used for co-ordination of distributed processes, its consistency semantics means that it's a good candidate for serving small (key,value) records as well. The Domain Name Service has similar requirements, raising the interesting question of whether ZooKeeper would be a capable DNS server for your local network. One intriguing possibility is having versioned DNS records, such that known-good configurations can be stored and rolled back to in the case of an issue. If this versioning primitive proves to be useful, it's easy to imagine other types of configuration that could be stored.

This project would involve designing and building an RFC-1035 compliant DNS server and performing a detailed performance study against an already existant simple DNS server like tinydns.
