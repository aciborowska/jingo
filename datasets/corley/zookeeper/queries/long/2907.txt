There are two places in the server code that log request errors with a message ala "Dumping request buffer..." followed by a hex dump of the request buffer. There are 2 major problems with this output:


	The request type is not output
	The byte-to-hex inline code doesn't pad numbers < 16



These two combine to make the output data nearly useless.
