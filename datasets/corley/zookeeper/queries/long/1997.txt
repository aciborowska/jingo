A server goes to standalone mode if there is only a single server line in server list description.

In fact, the server line was ignored.

The test testStandaloneQuorum was incorrectly successful before â€“ the client port was ignored and the server was responding through the jetty port.

When I do a client port check, it failed.

This is caused by the logic in checkvalidity:

 if (numMembers > 1  || (!standaloneEnabled && numMembers > 0)) {
...


This would assume it's standaloneEnabled mode and won't take anything in server list where the client port is defined as introduced in 3.5 dynamic config format.

This is undesired after introducing reconfig because a cluster could set up one server and then add more later.
