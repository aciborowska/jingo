I downloaded ZK 3.4.3 sources and ran ant test. Many of the tests failed, including ZooKeeperTest. A common symptom was spurious ConnectionLossException:

As background, I was actually investigating some non-deterministic failures when using Netflix's Curator with Java 7 (see https://github.com/Netflix/curator/issues/79). After a while, I figured I should establish a clean ZK baseline first and realized it is actually a ZK issue, not a Curator issue.

We are trying to migrate to Java 7 but this is a blocking issue for us right now.
