Dynamic config requires observer has unique server id, which means we cannot simply add observer with dynamic server id -1. For large observer cluster, it's much more easier to add observer without unique server id if it doesn't need to be promoted to participant. Also, it will make dynamic config more efficient, we don't need to store and send the long list of observers during re-config.
