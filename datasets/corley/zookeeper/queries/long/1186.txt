ZooKeeper client seems to hang quietly on OutOfMemoryError.

Look at code of ClientCnxn.SendThread.run:


void run() {
  while (zooKeeper.state.isAlive()) {
    try {
      ...
    } catch (Exception e) {
      // handle exception and restart
    }
  }
  ...
}



If OutOfMemoryError happens somewhere inside of try block, thread just exits and ZooKeeper hangs.

Client should handle any Throwable same way it handles Exception.
