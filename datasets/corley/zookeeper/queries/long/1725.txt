When writing the dynamic configuration out, Zookeeper writes out hostnames, even if an IP address is supplied.  These may not correctly round-trip (e.g. 127.0.0.1 might be written as localhost which may then resolve to 127.0.0.1 and another IP address).

This isn't actually causing problems for me right now, but seems very likely to cause hard-to-track-down problems in future.
