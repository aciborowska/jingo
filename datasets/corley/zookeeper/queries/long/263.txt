The java API docs talk about the host:port comma separated list, however the forrest docs don't mention this. it's confusing for users, they don't know that the connection string can be a list of host:port comma separated. We should mention in the programmer guide, perhaps even in the overview/started (mention in passing and reference the prog guide for full detail).

Also the java doc should be updated, right now we have a "see also" in the short constructor, to make it more explicit we should copy/paste the docs.

The c client should also be updated to detail that it's a comma separated list of host:port (similar to java). Right host we just say "host", need to be more explicit as to the format of the string.
