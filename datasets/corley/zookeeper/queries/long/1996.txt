Documentation contains the following warning about FreeBSD:
http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.6/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_systemReq
-------
FreeBSD is supported as a development and production platform for clients only. Java NIO selector support in the FreeBSD JVM is broken.
-------

I believe it is outdated info from pre-OpenJDK time.  With recent OpenJDK-7
I am running Zookeeper in production without any problems and I asked other people who run it on FreeBSD, they also experience no trouble.

I propose to remove this information and list FreeBSD as supported platform unless you know something bad in particular.
