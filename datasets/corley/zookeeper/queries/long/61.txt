Many of the java client/server test cases use "sleep" during initial rendezvous. This makes the tests slow, very brittle and they tend to fail occasionally during CI (depending on load). In particular I've seen QuorumTest exhibit this.

Would also be nice if we could extract the "base" client/server test functionality to enable re-use and make test writing easier. I started this with ClientBase in tests but could do a better job.
