If an out of memory occurs during snapshotting we recover from the error, however we should be more explict about the problem. 

Currently we log a warning, really we should log a FATAL and exit. This would force the server to restart (supervisor) and make it very clear to the user there is a problem. In some cases users don't notice the OOM exception (we have trouble noticing it sometimes ourselves) as it doesn't stand out on the logs. Exiting would be more explicit. However since we'd like to remove sysexits due to container issues it's not clear what we should do here in addition to making this FATAL.
