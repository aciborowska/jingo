Hi, All

 We are building high-availability ZooKeeper cluster at AWS and using version 3.5.0 because it support dynamic re-configuration. Everything works but one problem: it is difficult for ZooKeeper clients to discover current ensemble list. Obvious solution is to put ZooKeeper behind AWS load balancer. Client during initialization will call ZooKeeper via load balancer to read /zookeeper/config and will be able to build connection string. We quickly discovered ZooKeeper API not working trough AWS load-balancer.

 ZooKeeper, starting from 3.5.0, support AdminServer option which working just fine behind any type of load balancers. The catch is: no command avail to date to get list of hosts representing ensemble. 

http://localhost:8080/commands/...

provide a lot of info but none of them returns


server.4108=10.50.4.108:2888:3888:participant;0.0.0.0:2181
server.316=10.50.3.16:2888:3888:participant;0.0.0.0:2181
server.1215=10.50.1.215:2888:3888:participant;0.0.0.0:2181
version=100000000



 I think it would be very useful add new command:

http://localhost:8080/commands/dconfig

 which will return current ZooKeeper dynamic comfiguration:


{
  "server.4108"  :  "10.50.4.108:2888:3888:participant;0.0.0.0:2181",
   "server.316" : "10.50.3.16:2888:3888:participant;0.0.0.0:2181",
   "server.1215" : "10.50.1.215:2888:3888:participant;0.0.0.0:2181"
   "version" : "100000000"
}



Thank you,
Grisha
