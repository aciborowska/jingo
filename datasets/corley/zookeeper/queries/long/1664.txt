Java on Linux/Solaris can be set up to use the native (via C library)
GSS implementation. This is configured by setting the system property
   sun.security.jgss.native=true
When using this feature, ZooKeeper Sasl/JGSS authentication doesn't work.
The reason is explained in
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/jgss-features.html

"""
[when using native GSS...]
In addition, when performing operations as a particular Subject, e.g. 
Subject.doAs(...) or Subject.doAsPrivileged(...), the to-be-used 
GSSCredential should be added to Subject's private credential set. 
Otherwise, the GSS operations will fail since no credential is found.
