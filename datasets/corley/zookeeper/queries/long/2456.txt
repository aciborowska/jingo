Currently zookeeper server same field is used to store both user name and password
Provide a mechanism to separate the user and password either by adding new field or by adding new API

DETAILS:
org.apache.zookeeper.data.Id class is used to store scheme and id.

public Id( String scheme, String id)


id field holds only user in most cases but in some cases it holds user as well as password
By default there are only four authentication provider 
DigestAuthenticationProvider
IPAuthenticationProvider
SASLAuthenticationProvider
X509AuthenticationProvider
In code we can check if scheme is digest then id.split(":")[0] is user otherwise id is user. This will work only if we are limited to above four authentication provider
But Custom authentication provider are very important and are very commonly used. How the zookeeper code will know what is the user, is it id or id.split(":")[0] or anything else ?
So there is need to add new API which AuthenticationProvider providers implement to define what is user.
