While trying to create a test case showing slow average add_auth, i stumbled upon a test case that reliably segfaults for me, albeit with variable amount of iterations (anwhere from 0 to 20 typically). fwiw, I've got about 220 processes in my test environment (ubuntu lucid 10.04). The test case opens a connection, adds authentication to it, and closes the connection, in a loop. I'm including the sample program and the gdb stack traces from the core file. I can upload the core file if thats helpful.
