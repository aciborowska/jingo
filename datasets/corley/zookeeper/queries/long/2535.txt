zookeeper_server's pid should be created once server is started completely and not before, problem with current approach :-
Scenario:-
1. Configure below in zoo.cfg
dataDir=/home/Rakesh/Zookeeper/18_Aug/zookeeper-3.5.1-alpha/data
2. Start zookeeper server
3. Change the dataDir to suppose
dataDir=/home/Rakesh/Zookeeper/18_Aug/zookeeper-3.5.1-alpha/data1
4. Again start zookeeper without stopping zookeeper.

Though it will fail to start the server as port is already bind, it will create "zookeeper_server.pid" file with different PID inside and "version-2" folder

Now again revertback the dataDir path and stop the server, the new created folder and file at step 4 remained
