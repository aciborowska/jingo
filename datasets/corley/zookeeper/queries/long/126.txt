Moving the hang issue from ZOOKEEPER-63 to here. See 63 for background and potential patch (patch_ZOOKEEPER-63.patch).

specifically (from James): 

"I'm thinking the close() method should not wait() forever on the disconnect packet, just a closeTimeout length - say a few seconds. Afterall blocking and forcing a reconnect just to redeliver the disconnect packet seems a bit silly - when the server has to deal with clients which just have their sockets fail anyway"
