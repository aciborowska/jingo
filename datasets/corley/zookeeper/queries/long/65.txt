We should log information on the connection to enable better field issue debugging.

In particular if we logged the connection latency (time for req->resp) during session establishment this would give some information about the connection. We should log the initial reading at INFO level, then log subsequent information at trace level.

Would be nice to log trace events for client/server pings for example.
