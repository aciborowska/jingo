It is good to have a command which can give complete summary of zookeeper ensemble. Ensemble summary should give information about who is leader, which are followers, observers.

Consider a zookeeper cluster with following configurations
server.1=localhost:33230:33235:participant;localhost:33222
server.2=localhost:33231:33236:participant;localhost:33223
server.3=localhost:33232:33237:participant;localhost:33224
server.4=localhost:33233:33238:participant;localhost:33225
server.5=localhost:33234:33239:participant;localhost:33226

When four servers are running and we execute esum(Ensemble Summary Command) command we should get status of all the servers and their roles

Example:

server.1=localhost:33230:33235:participant;localhost:33222 FOLLOWING
Client Connections:1

server.2=localhost:33231:33236:participant;localhost:33223 FOLLOWING
Client Connections:0

server.3=localhost:33232:33237:participant;localhost:33224 NOT RUNNING

server.4=localhost:33233:33238:participant;localhost:33225 FOLLOWING
Client Connections:0

server.5=localhost:33234:33239:participant;localhost:33226 LEADING
Client Connections:0
