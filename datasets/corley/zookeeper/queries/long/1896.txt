When upgrading from 3.4.6 (rc0 actually) to 3.5.0 (trunk as of two weeks ago actually) I got this error message:


2014-02-26 22:12:15,446 - ERROR [WorkerReceiver[myid=4]] - Something went wrong while processing config received from 3



According to Flavio Junqueira:

I think you’re right that the reconfig error is harmless, but we shouldn’t be getting it. The problem is that it is not detecting that we are in backward compatibility mode. We need to fix it for 3.5.0 and perhaps ZOOKEEPER-1805 is the right place for doing it.
