ZOOKEEPER-2355 added a getQuorumPeer method to QuorumPeerMainÂ https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/release-3.5.3/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/QuorumPeerMain.java#L194. TestingQuorumPeerMain has an identically named method, which is now unintentionally overridding the one in the base class.

This is fixed by CURATOR-409, however, I'd like this to be fixed in ZooKeeper as well.
