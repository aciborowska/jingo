Currently our system tests are lumped in with our unit tests. It would be great to have a system test environment where we could run larger scale testing. Say you have 20 hosts, and you would like to test a serving ensemble with 7 servers and 100 clients running particular operations. It should be easy to test this scenario. Additionally during the test it should be possible to simulate serving node failure, etc...

I've had a brief conversation with Ben about this and he's going to take this JIRA.
