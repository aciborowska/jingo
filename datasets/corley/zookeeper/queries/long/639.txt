here are some more improvements to Zab. the patch is a bit stale, but i don't want to lose track of it. there are two big improvements:

1) transaction logs are reused. this saves time over growing the log files and if you preallocate a bunch of log files on an empty partition, you will see a nice performance boost
2) acks and commits are always sent in order, so if there is a bunch to send, they will get merged into a single ack or commit.
