When I run the test using (jdk8 tag):
https://hub.docker.com/r/phunt/zk-docker-devenv.ubuntu.14.04/tags/
it fails with an IPV6 failure. afaict the container does not have ipv6 configured, although the kernel has it available as a feature. I believe this to be the real issue - it's a kernel feature but no available in the runtime.
