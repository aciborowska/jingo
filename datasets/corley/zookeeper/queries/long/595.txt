I'd like to ask a running quorum what its configuration is.  I'd want to know stuff like session timeout and tick times.

Use case is that in hbase there is no zoo.cfg usually; the configuration is manufactured and piped to the starting zk server.  I want to know if all of the manufactured config. 'took' or how zk interpreted it.
