For instance, the original data for znode1 and znode2 are 2 and 4 respectively. I want to perform increment operations over them. Finally, I would get (3, 5) for znode1 and znode2. In order to keep atomicity, I used multi() api. Is there any possibility that any clients could read (3, 4) concurrently? That is, the read happened after znode1++ and before znode2++?
