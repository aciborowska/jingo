Our system administrators would love it if we could configure ZooKeeper to listen for client and quorum connections on a hostname which isn't bound to the localhost.

Maybe there's some neat way to do this I'm not aware of already, of course, but it looks to me like we would need to change the two ss.socket().bind(new InetSocketAddress(port)); calls, one in NIOServerCnxn and one in QuorumCnxManager to so that they instead used InetSocketAddress(host, port).  Obviously that implies some optional definition of a hostname in the config file as well and possibly on the command-line.

Does that seem like the right approach?
