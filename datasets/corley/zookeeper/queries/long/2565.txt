listquota <path> should display the quota even it is set on parent/child node. As of now if we have a parent-child hierarchy for example n1->n2->n3 and quota is set for n2. If we try to get quota details on n1 and n3 using listquota, it says no quota set but if try to set the quota on those nodes it fails saying quota is already set on parent node...
So listquota should fetch the quota set on any node in hierarchy with exact path (on which quota is set) even though this api is called on any other node in that hierarchy.
