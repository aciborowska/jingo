The test-suite org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.ReconfigRecoveryTest fails intermittently on ppc64le and x86 architechture. I have attached standard output log. The error message is as follows:

Testcase: testCurrentServersAreObserversInNextConfig took 90.488 sec
        FAILED
waiting for server 3 being up
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: waiting for server 3 being up
        at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.ReconfigRecoveryTest.testCurrentServersAreObserversInNextConfig(ReconfigRecoveryTest.java:217)
        at org.apache.zookeeper.JUnit4ZKTestRunner$LoggedInvokeMethod.evaluate(JUnit4ZKTestRunner.java:79)



Also this issue is related to ZOOKEEPER-1806 and ZOOKEEPER-2080. Both of them are marked as fixed and still i am getting this failure.
