As discussed during the 10/23 meeting, some messages in the java client logs are mixing up terms from different levels. For example:


2009-10-14 15:12:43,566 WARN org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn: Exception closing session 0x1244f619478000d to sun.nio.ch.SelectionKeyImpl@15e32c4
java.io.IOException: Session Expired
   at org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn$SendThread.readConnectResult(ClientCnxn.java:589)
   at org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn$SendThread.doIO(ClientCnxn.java:709)
   at org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn$SendThread.run(ClientCnxn.java:945)



Which session are we talking about in the first line? Now I know that it's a network-related session and not the ZK one, but I've seen many of our users getting confused over those lines.
