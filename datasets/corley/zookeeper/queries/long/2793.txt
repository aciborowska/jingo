QuorumServer will do the authorization checks against configured authorized hosts. During LE, QuorumLearner will send an authentication packet to QuorumServer. Now, QuorumServer will check that the connecting QuorumLearnerâ€™s hostname exists in the authorized hosts. If not exists then connecting peer is not authorized to join this ensemble and the request will be rejected immediately. 

In branch-3.4 building authzHosts list is pretty straight forward, can use the ensemble server details in zoo.cfg file. But with dynamic reconfig, it has to consider the dynamic add/remove/update servers and need to discuss the ways to handle dynamic cases.
