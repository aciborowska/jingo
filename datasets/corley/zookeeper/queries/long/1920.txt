A new ZooKeeper client will start three threads, the SendThread, EventThread and LoginThread. I belive that these threads will be shutdown after call the zk.close. I test that the SendThread and EventThread will be die,  but LoginThread is still alive. The stack is:

"Thread-0" daemon prio=10 tid=0x00007ffcf0020000 nid=0x69c8 waiting on condition [0x00007ffd3cc25000]
   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (sleeping)
