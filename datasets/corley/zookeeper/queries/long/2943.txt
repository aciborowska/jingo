Zookeeper Java client provides the StaticHostProvider to hold server addresses. The host name resolving only happen once when the StaticHostProvider instanced. In some situation, we use host name instead of IP addresses to smooth the changes of backend server movement. But client can't have the opportunity to resolve host name again. How can I do?
