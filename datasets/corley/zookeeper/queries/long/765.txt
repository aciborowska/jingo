When adding some zookeeper-based functionality to a python script I had to figure everything out without guidance, which while doable, would have been a lot easier with an example. I extracted a skeleton program structure out with hopes its useful to others (maybe add as an example in the source or wiki?).

This script does an aget() and sets a watch, and hopefully illustrates what's going on, and where to plug in your application code that gets run when the znode changes.

There are probably some bugs, which if we fix now and provide a well-reviewed example hopefully others will not run into the same mistakes.
