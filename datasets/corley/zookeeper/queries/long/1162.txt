Recently we encountered a sitaution where a zk directory got sucessfully populated with 250k elements.  When our system attempted to read the znode dir, it failed because the contents of the dir exceeded the default 1mb jute.maxbuffer limit.  There were a few odd things

1) It seems odd that we could populate to be very large but could not read the listing 
2) The workaround was bumping up jute.maxbuffer on the client side
Would it make more sense to have it reject adding new znodes if it exceeds jute.maxbuffer? 
Alternately, would it make sense to have zk dir listing ignore the jute.maxbuffer setting?
