Currently Zookeeper client expects zookeeper server's principal to be in the form of zookeeper.sasl.client.username/server-ip  for example zookeeper/192.162.1.100. 
But this may not always be the case server principal can be some thing like zookeeper/hadoop.foo.com
It would be better if we can make server principal configurable.

Current Code:

String principalUserName = System.getProperty(ZK_SASL_CLIENT_USERNAME, "zookeeper");
zooKeeperSaslClient = new ZooKeeperSaslClient(principalUserName + "/" + addr.getHostString());



Proposed Code:

String serverPrincipal = System.getProperty("zookeeper.server.principal");
if (null != serverPrincipal) {
    zooKeeperSaslClient = new ZooKeeperSaslClient(serverPrincipal);
} else {
    String principalUserName = System.getProperty(ZK_SASL_CLIENT_USERNAME, "zookeeper");
    zooKeeperSaslClient = new ZooKeeperSaslClient(principalUserName + "/" + addr.getHostString());
}
