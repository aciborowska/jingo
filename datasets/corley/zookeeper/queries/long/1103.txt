"Such uses of sleep [used in testFollowersStartAfterLeader] are just asking for trouble. Take a look at the use
of sleep in testSessionMove in the same class for a better way to do
this. I had gone through all the tests a while back, replacing all the
"sleep" with something like this testSessionMove pattern (retry
with a max limit that's very long). During reviews we should look for
anti-patterns like this and address them before commit."

So, modify testFollowersStartAfterLeaders to use the same retrying approach that testSessionMove uses.
