It would be extremely useful to be able to have a "getChildrenWithStat" method.  This method would behave exactly the same as getChildren but in addition to returning the list of all child znode names it would also return a Stat for each child.  I'm sure there are quite a few use cases for this but it could save a lot of extra reads for my application.
