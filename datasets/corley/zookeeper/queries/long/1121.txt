We are using zookeeper to store versions of business objects in order to achieve coherence, distributed locks, etc. These business objects have limited lifespans (i.e. objects created over a week ago are rarely accessed), so effectively, after some time period, we do not need their information in zookeeper anymore. It would be nice to have a built-in tool or mechanism for expiring old data, much like how PurgeTxnLog cleans the snapshot and transaction log files. 

Any thoughts on whether this can be supported or how it can be accomplished? Currently we are walking the tree and deleting nodes with an old mtime.
