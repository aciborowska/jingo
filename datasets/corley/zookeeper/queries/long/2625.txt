I provision a vagrant vm that installs zookeeper into /home/vagrant/zk and adjusts all owner and read/write rights.
With the vagrant user, I start zookeeper as bin/zkServer.sh start /vagrant/data/zoo.cfg
However, the folder data? (or data^M) gets created with the PID inside, instead of putting it into the data folder, which contains the version-2 folder.
Since I'm using the official start scripts, I'm at a loss.
Also, the data? folder comes with root:root ownership, which is strange, as zKServer.sh is executed from the vagrant user.
