LogFormatter and SnapshotFormatter does not handle FileNotFoundException gracefully. If file no exist then these classes propagate the exception to console.

Exception in thread "main" java.io.FileNotFoundException: log.1 (The system cannot find the file specified)
        at java.io.FileInputStream.open(Native Method)
        at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:146)
        at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:101)

 File existence should be validated and appropriate message should be displayed on console if file does not exist
