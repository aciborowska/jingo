We need to put some sanity checks in QuorumCnxnManager and the other quorum port for rogue clients. Sometimes a clients might get misconfigured and they might send random characters on such ports. We need to make sure that such rogue clients do not bring down the clients and need to put in some sanity checks with respect to packet lengths and deserialization.
