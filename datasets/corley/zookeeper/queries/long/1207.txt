I'm seeing a strange ERROR message when starting an ensemble:


2011-09-27 13:00:08,168 [myid:3] - ERROR [Thread-2:QuorumPeer$1@689] - FAILED to start ReadOnlyZooKeeperServer
java.lang.InterruptedException: sleep interrupted
	at java.lang.Thread.sleep(Native Method)
	at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeer$1.run(QuorumPeer.java:684)



I did not specify ReadOnlyZooKeeperServer, also why is this at ERROR level? I'm not sure the expected behavior here. Is r/o turned on by default? Seems we should have this as a config option, off by default.
