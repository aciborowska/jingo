StaticHostProvider#updateServerList uses wrong syntax to embed https link in the java doc. Previously this issue was not visible because StaticHostProvider was not public of public java doc; after ZOOKEEPER-2829 StaticHostProvider is now part of API doc and incorrect syntax leads to java doc warnings, which creates noises in Jenkins pre-commit jobs.
