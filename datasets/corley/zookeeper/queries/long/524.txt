DBSizeTest looks like it should be testing latency, but it doesn't seem to do it (assert is commented out).

We need to decide if this test should be fixed, or just dropped.

Also note: this test takes 40seconds on my system. Way too long. Perhaps async create operations should be used
to populate the database. I also noticed that data size has a big impact on overall test time (1k vs 5 bytes is something
like a 2x time diff for time to run the test).
