Start an quorum with 3 (let say A, B, C) zookeepers, stop 2 zookeepers and let one running, install and configure new quorum (A, A2, A3, A4, A5) where A is common but now has configuration of new quorum. When start A, it getting synced the configuration with previous quorum

Steps to reproduce:-
1. Configure and start quorum of 3 nodes (A, B, C) -> 1st quorum
2. stop 2 nodes and let running 3rd node (say C)
3. Create new quorum of 5 nodes (A, A2, A3, A4, A5) where A has same IP and port which was used in 1st quorum but A's configuration is as per new quorum (where details of A, A2, A3, A4, A5) are present and not B & C.
4. Now start 2nd quorum. Here A's dynamic configuration is getting changed according to 1st quorum

Problems:-
1. Now A node is neither syncing all data with 1st quorum nor with 2nd quorum
2. Big security flaw and the whole quorum can be screwed
