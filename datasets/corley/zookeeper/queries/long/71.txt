This JIRA is to collect feedback and document what we will be doing re changelog file(s) in zookeeper SVN repository/release.

See ZOOKEEPER-45 for some background, summary:


	suggestion was made to have single CHANGES.txt, similar to hadoop core/hbase
   However a concern was brought up that it would be better to have 2 files - one for java code (client & server) and one for C client. This would make it easier for users to discern (C client users would see it broken out in separate file)



Please add comments/votes for what you think we should do.
