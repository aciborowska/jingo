We need document the correct approach (use watchers combined with zookeeper_interest, select, and zookeeper_process) for monitoring connection events between client and server using single thread C library. See examples https://goo.gl/hql4B1 and https://github.com/fpj/zookeeper-book-example/blob/master/src/main/c/master.c. In particular emphasis that the return code of zookeeper_interest should not be relied for connection monitoring purposes.
