Scenario 1:-
When provide path for "dataDir" with trailing space, it is taking correct path (by trucating space) for snapshot but creating temporary file with some junk folder name for zookeeper_server.pid

Steps to reproduce:-
1. Configure the dataDir
dataDir=/home/Rakesh/Zookeeper/18_Aug/zookeeper-3.5.1-alpha/data 
Here there is a space after /data 
2. Start Zookeeper Server
3. The snapshot is getting created at location mentioned above by truncating the trailing space but
one temp folder with junk name (like -> D29D4X~J) is getting created for zookeeper_server.pid

Scenario 2:-
When configure the heading and trailing space in above mentioned scenario. the temp folder is getting created in zookeeper/bin folder
