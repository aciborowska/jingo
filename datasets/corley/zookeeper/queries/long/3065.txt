The following issues would be nice to address:

	Tests cover addresses with IP addresses only, a few of them test unresolved hostnames, but ideal would be to create Test parameters and run all tests for both cases,
	Test methods should be split into multiple to cover one test case / test method,
	Style: instead of assertTrue(a < b), we should use assertThat(b, greaterThan(a))
	Extract redundant code snippets into methods
