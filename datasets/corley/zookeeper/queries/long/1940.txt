Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications.

It's become quite popular and I'd like to see the zookeeper community suggest a standard way to run zookeeper inside docker containers. To get the conversation started, I have a working example at:

https://github.com/medined/docker-zookeeper

I hope there is a better technique that I used. And if there is please make suggestions.

The difficulty, I think, posed by Docker, is that the images are started before the bridge network is created. This means, again I think, that zookeeper is running inside the container with no way to communicate with the ensemble for some non-trivial amount of time. 

My resolution to this was to force each each to wait 30 seconds before  starting zookeeper. I still see connection errors in the logs, but eventually the cluster settles and everything seems to work.

I'm hoping that someone which more networking experience than I can find a way to eliminate that 30 second delay and the connection errors during startup.

Thanks for reading this far.
