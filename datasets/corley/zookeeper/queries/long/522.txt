Currently the zookeeper client library keeps connecting to servers if all of them are unreachable. It will go through the list time and again and try to connect. Sometimes, this might cause problems like too many clients retrying connect to servers (and there might be something wrong/delay with servers) wherein the clients will give up and will try reconnecting to other servers. This causes a huge churn in client connections sometimes leading to the zookeeper server running out of file handles.
