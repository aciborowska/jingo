1.the finish() of Send/RecvWorker in QuorumCnxManager changes to double-checked lock style https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-checked_locking

2.testInitiateConnection() is redundant test function which is only used in TestCase,so I refactor it.
3.some codes don't abide to Java Programme Specification ,so I lift a finger to format them
