it would be very useful if the java shell showed the current connection status as part of the command prompt.

this shows itself in particular for the following use case:

I attempted to connect a java shell to a remote cluster that was unavailable, when I run the first command "ls /" on
the cluster the shell hangs. It would be nice if the shell indicated connection status in the prompt and make it more
clear that the shell is currently not connected. (it was hard to see the "attempting to connect" console message as
it was lost in with the other messaes...)
