I am working on integrating ZooKeeper into HBase. I've found myself copying a lot of the test infrastructure code from places like zk.t.QuorumTest to create classes like MiniZooKeeper so that I can test my new additions in HBase. I think things would be a lot easier if we shipped a ZooKeeper test jar for others to use. Additionally, I think we should clean up the test code a bit so that the tests use some common infrastructure rather than each doing its own setup/teardown of a ZK cluster. I believe this is how things are done for testing Hadoop things HBase.

For more context, see hbase-1144.patch in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1144

I would do this myself but I can't currently contribute to Apache projects other than HBase because of company issues.
