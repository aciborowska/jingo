Add an option to zkCli to wait for connection before executing any commands.
This is helpful for the execution of inline commands.

We are having some scripts to create/delete znodes through commandline. But if getting the connection delays due to one of the node down, then command will fail with connectionloss even though quorum is available.

So I propose a commandline option (similar to -server and -timeout) "-waitforconnection" to wait for the connection before executing any commands.
