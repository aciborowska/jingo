Jenkins (Hudson) shows an error when running test-cppunit. I am not able to replicate this error on my own build machine, so I am unable to diagnose. Perhaps someone with access to the Apache Jenkins. Please see attached output from https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-Build/163//console (click on "full" to see the attached output if your browser can handle that much text).
