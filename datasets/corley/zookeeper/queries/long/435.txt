the server has a "super" digest based auth user that enables administrative access (ie has access to znodes regardless
of acl settings) but the password is not configurable

1) make the default digest null, ie turn off "super" by default
2) if a command line option is specified when starting server then use the provided digest for super

eg. java -Dzookeeper.DigestAuthenticationProvider.superDigest=xkxkxkxkx ....

also this is not documented in the forrest docs - need to add that along with tests as part of the patch.
