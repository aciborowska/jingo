I use zk to  monitor the children nodes under a path, eg: /servers. 
when the client is told that children changes,  I have to re-watch the path again, during the peroid, it's possible that some children down, or some up. And those events will be missed.

For now, my temporary solution is not to use getChildren(path, true...) to get children and re-watch this path, but re-watch this path first, then get the children. Thus non events can be ignored, but I don't know what will the zk server be like if there are too much clients that act like this.

How do you think of this problem? Is there any other solutions?
