Contrary to the documentation, it is not possible to upgrade via reconfig a Participant+Observer cluster to a Participant+Participant cluster. KeeperException.NewConfigNoQuorum is thrown instead.

PrepRequestProcessor should recognize this special case and let it pass. Test will be enclosed shortly. I'll work on a fix as well, but I imagine that Alexander Shraer will want to look at it.
