maps getaddrinfo() return values indicating a transient failure (e.g. EAI_AGAIN) to same value (EINVAL) that zookeeper_init() uses to indicate permanent problems (like empty host spec or invalid port).
As a result client code has no way to decide whether it should re-try the initialization or abort (asking for manual intervention).

As discussed e.g. in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-3790 zookeeper should most likely retry on this and other transient failures automagically.  Independently, the switch above should be fixed to map EAI_* values to different E* values allowing client code some flexibility in handling and reporting errors deemed permanent by zookeeper.

Note that there is a related bug https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1451 â€“ zookeeper also does not report the problem properly in its own logs, making debugging these problems even harder.
