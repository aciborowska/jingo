Create a project structure that separates the different parts of ZooKeeper into a more meaningful packages for the future maven build.

This should be done in iterations to limit the impact.


	First iteration - safe changes including moving src/docs to zk-docs, creating zk-it empty directory. Build and conf directory remains unchanged. These changes also have minimum impact on PRâ€™s.
	Second iteration - move src/recipes to zk-recipes.
	Third iteration - move src/contrib to zk-contrib.
	Fourth iteration - move src/c to zk-client (java will be moved in Phase 2)




	Fifth iteration - move jute under src directory




	Sixth iteration - move src/java/main to zk-server, which will be further separated in Step 2.
