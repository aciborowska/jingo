Recently, carried out a test to to find the behavior of clients when a  zookeeper server is isolated from the zookeeper leader.

Here used a ensemble of 3 zookeeper servers called A, B and C. And quorum was set up like below. 

A - Follower 
B - Leader 
C - Followerâ€‹ 

A  <==> B <==> C 
 I____________I

And 3 clients are connected to ensemble like below. 

C1 is connected A. Both C1 and A are in the same machine.
C2 is connected B. Both C2 and B are in the same machine.
C3 is connected C. Both C3 and C are in the same machine.

To remove the network link between B and C iptables utility is used. 

command used: 
iptables -I INPUT -s Server_B_IP -j DROP 
iptables -I INPUT -s Server_C_IP -j DROP 

After removing the link connections looks like below. 

A  <===> B             C 
 I________I

Simply there is no way to send any packets from zookeeper server  B to zookeeper server C and vice versa. But the connection exists between between B and C. And also there is no way to send any packets from  B to C3 and vice versa. But the connection exists between between B and C3. 

Here What I noticed is that the client connected to Zookeeper Server "C", could not connect to the ensemble, resulting a session expiration timeout. 

For this experiment I used tickTime of 3000ms and client session expiration timeout of 45000ms. And tested with different combinations also.
