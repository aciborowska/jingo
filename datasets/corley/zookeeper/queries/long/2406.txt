The comment in zkEnv.sh indicates that /etc/zookeeper should be an option for the ZOOCFGDIR but the code beneath it does not look to see if it exists:


# We use ZOOCFGDIR if defined,                                                                                                                                                                
# otherwise we use /etc/zookeeper                                                                                                                                                             
# or the conf directory that is                                                                                                                                                               
# a sibling of this script's directory   


ZOOBINDIR="${ZOOBINDIR:-/usr/bin}"
ZOOKEEPER_PREFIX="${ZOOBINDIR}/.."

if [ "x$ZOOCFGDIR" = "x" ]
then
  if [ -e "${ZOOKEEPER_PREFIX}/conf" ]; then
    ZOOCFGDIR="$ZOOBINDIR/../conf"
  else
    ZOOCFGDIR="$ZOOBINDIR/../etc/zookeeper"
  fi
fi                                                                                                                                                     



Should this be something like:


if [ "x$ZOOCFGDIR" = "x" ]
then
  if [ -e "/etc/zookeeper" ]; then
    ZOOCFGDIR="/etc/zookeeper"
  elif [ -e "${ZOOKEEPER_PREFIX}/conf" ]; then
    ZOOCFGDIR="$ZOOBINDIR/../conf"
  else
    ZOOCFGDIR="$ZOOBINDIR/../etc/zookeeper"
  fi
fi            



I am not sure if ZOOBINDIR/../etc/zookeeper is supposed to be an option or a typo but in the default setup ZOOBINDIR/../conf exists so even if it were changed to /etc/zookeeper it would never try to use it.
