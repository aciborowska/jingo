I am trying to run zookeeper version 2.11-1.1.0 on 32 bit machine. I have installed jdk 1.8.0_181 but zookeeper is not running and displaying following error:

Error: missingÂ {{server' JVM at }}C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_181\bin\server\jvm.dll'.
Please install or use the JRE or JDK that contains these missing components.

This is because for jdk1.8.0_181 is not creating server folder which contains jvm.dll.

So please let me know how is zookeeper going to address this issue. Because if this issue is not resolved zookeeper won't run on 32 bit machine.
