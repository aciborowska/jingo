1. I have a question about the following piece of code in QCM:

if (remoteSid == QuorumPeer.OBSERVER_ID) {
 /* * Choose identifier at random. We need a value to identify * the connection. */ 
remoteSid = observerCounter--;
LOG.info("Setting arbitrary identifier to observer: " + remoteSid); 
}

Should we allow this? The problem with this code is that if a peer
connects twice with QuorumPeer.OBSERVER_ID, we will end up creating
threads for this peer twice. This could result in redundant
SendWorker/RecvWorker threads.

I haven't used observers yet. The documentation
http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/r3.3.0/zookeeperObservers.html
says that just like followers, observers should have server IDs. In
which case, why do we want to provide a wild-card?
