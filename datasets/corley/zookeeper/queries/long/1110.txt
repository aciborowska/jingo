The correct step about close client is the client send CLOSE_OP to the server, wait for several seconds, the server will process the terminal request and close the fd.
But the zookeeper_close interface is wrong, because the adaptor_send_queue(zh, 3000) (line 2332), will first wait the timeout then send the request.
The right order is first send the request then wait the timeout. I change as follow:
$svn diff src/c/src/zookeeper.c
