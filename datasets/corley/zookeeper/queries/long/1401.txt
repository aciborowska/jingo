There are a bunch of things that would be useful/reusable from ZK Java client, such as ACL parsing. Also, it would be nice to see other utilities for dealing with path creation ("mkdir -p ...") readily available for clients rather than implementing in downstream projects. Some of this can be seen in HIVE-2712.
