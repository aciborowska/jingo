Zookeeper version : 3.4.9

OS version is ubuntu 14.04(trusty)

Default configuration of zoo.cfg 
tickTime=2000
initLimit=10
syncLimit=5

I have setup the zookeeper ensemble with three servers zk1.com, zk2.com, zk3.com.

Initial State:

ZK1(FOLLOWER)--ZK2(LEADER)------ZK3(FOLLOWER)


This morning, ZK2(LEADER) went down and it became a FOLLOWER with in fraction of seconds. It took 20 minutes for new LEADER to be decided for the ensemble. ZK3 was the new LEADER.

New State:
ZK(FOLLOWER)---ZK2(FOLLOWER)----ZK3(LEADER) (after 20 minutes).


Can somone help me to debug what happened? 

Zookeeper is managing the solr cloud 2shards, 4 nodes.
