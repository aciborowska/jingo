Current DataNode.getChildren() directly returns a pointer of its private member,  children. However, the member should be modified through addChild() and removeChild(). Callers of getChildren() shouldn't modify it directly.

For preventing the direct modification by the callers, this patch lets getChildren() return an unmodifiable view of its children set. If the callers try to modify directly, runtime exception will be risen.
