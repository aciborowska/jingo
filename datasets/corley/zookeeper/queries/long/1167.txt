Reading through the source, the C API implements zoo_async() which is the zookeeper sync() method implemented in the multithreaded/asynchronous C API.  It doesn't implement anything equivalent in the non-multithreaded API.

I'm not sure if this was oversight or intentional, but it means that the non-multithreaded API can't guarantee consistent client views on critical reads.

The zkperl bindings depend on the synchronous, non-multithreaded API so also can't call sync() currently.
