the parseACLs(String aclString) method attempts to prase ACLs from the form of scheme:id:perm into the three components, delineated by the colons.  The current version calls indexOf for both the first and second colon, receiving the same value for both and failing as if there were only one colon in the string.  I created a one-line patch to call lastIndexOf for the second colon.
