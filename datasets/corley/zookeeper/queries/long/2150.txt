We have pool of zookeeper machines (contains both active and observer) in version 3.4.3. 
We recently undated our exhibitor from 1.2.x to 1.5.4. 
We are seeing a strange behavior in our observers: they keep losing connection with the active ensemble and do not recover. The connection goes into CLOSE_WAIT state. Dont think there is any relation to exhibitor.
