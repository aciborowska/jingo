We are developing a timestamp server to offer a precise auto increasing timestamp for other processes. ZooKeeper is used to select the master and store the persistent max offered timestamp. 

Now I'm not sure if the zookeeper servers work well no matter how much I damage the cluster randomly. So we need unit tests but ZooKeeper doesn't provides a single-process  cluster for us. Should we implement the similar code like what HBase did in MiniZooKeeperCluster.java ?
