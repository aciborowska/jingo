It would be interesting to use BookKeeper as a sequencer for a number of parallel streams of events. The general idea is to use BookKeeper to establish a total order on the events of concurrent streams, and use the ordered sequence as the input of an architectural element that processes the events in the streams. This way the state of the element is reproducible.

Given that we currently interleave the entries of concurrent ledgers in a bookie for writing efficiently, I believe it wouldn't be difficult to extend the interface to enable such a feature.
