Steps to reproduce:

	setup zookeeper
	setup TCP load balancer. This balancer should check zookeeper clientPort liveness(healthcheck) by opening and closing TCP connection to clientPort. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/ or https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-your-first-digitalocean-load-balancer#step-2-â€”-creating-the-load-balancer for details.
	in logs:

2017-03-17 15:41:19,843 [myid:1] - WARN  [NIOServerCxn.Factory:0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181:NIOServerCnxn@357] - caught end of stream exception
EndOfStreamException: Unable to read additional data from client sessionid 0x0, likely client has closed socket
	at org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxn.doIO(NIOServerCnxn.java:228)
	at org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxnFactory.run(NIOServerCnxnFactory.java:203)
	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)





Issue is here:
https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/5fe68506f217246c7ebd96803f9c78e13ec2f11a/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/NIOServerCnxn.java#L322

-1 is a normal socket termination. 

Expected:

	reduce log level to INFO
	do not log stacktrace.
