We are using maven licensing pluging (org.linuxstuff.maven:licensing-maven-plugin) to check/enforce licensing requirements for our dependencies and noticed that zookeper doesn't include licensing terms in pom.xml which causes the plugin to report the above mentioned warning (see the summary). 

Is there any plan to add the license to pom.xml as well?
