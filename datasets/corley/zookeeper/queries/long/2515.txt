While calling SessionTrackerImpl#shutdown does result in the thread eventually stopping, it takes up to expirationInterval (3 seconds, by default) for the thread to finally die.

Since the thread is not a daemon, this delays the shutdown of any application that makes use of ZooKeeper.

I believe the issue is simple to fix: if the shutdown method notified the thread from within object's monitor then this issue will be resolved.
