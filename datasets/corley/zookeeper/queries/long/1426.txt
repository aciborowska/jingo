Add a version command to the zkServer.sh. 

Hadoop does this by having a special main class: org.apache.hadoop.util.VersionInfo

We could do something similar, hook it into our current version information class (perhaps add main to that class).

Would also need to add a new "version" command to zkServer.sh that calls this.
