I'd like to move classes that are not part of the API but belong to the ZK Client into a separate Client package. These classes are:


	Inner classes that should become normal classes:
  Zookeeper.ZkWatchManager
  Zookeeper.WatchRegistration
  ClientCnxn.SendThread (should become a Runnable anyhow)
  ClientCnxn.EventThread
  ClientCnxn.Package
  ClientCnxn.AuthData ?




	Classes now in the zookeeper package:
  ClientCnxn -> Client.Cnxn
  ClientCnxnSocket* -> Client.CnxnSocket*
  ... Maybe some others that can be moved without breaking the API




	Classes yet to be written:
  PendingQueue ?
  OutgoingQueue ?
