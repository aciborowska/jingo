For some use cases in HBase (HBASE-1316 in particular) we'd like the ability to forcible expire someone else's ZK session. Patrick and I discussed on IRC and came up with an idea of creating nodes in /zookeeper/sessions/<session id> that can be read in order to get basic stats about a session, and written in order to manipulate one. The manipulation we need in HBase is the ability to write a command like "kill", but others might be useful as well.
