There are 2 issues with the current jute generated C++ code.

1. Variable declaration for JRecord is incorrect. It looks something like this:

 
    Id id;


It should be like this instead:

 
 org::apache::zookeeper::data::Id mid;



2. The header file declares all the variables (except for JRecord ones) with "m" prefix, but the .cc file doesn't use the prefix.
