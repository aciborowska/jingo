The zookeeper ganglia plugin script makes number of mntr calls to the zookeeper node for each of the metric, which seems to be an overhead to the zookeeper. I think it could be improvised to make a single mntr call and collect the metric data and send all the metrics information collected from a single mntr command (that is run every 60s interval) to the ganglia.

The change and github pull request is at https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/8

Please let me know if there are any other changes required here.

thanks,
