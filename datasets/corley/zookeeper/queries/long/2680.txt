DataNode.getChildren() API returns null and empty set if there are no children in it depending on when the API is called. DataNode.getChildren() API behavior should be changed and it should always return empty set if the node does not have any child

DataNode.getChildren() API Current Behavior:

	returns null initially
When DataNode is created and no children are added yet, DataNode.getChildren() returns null
	returns empty set after all the children are deleted:
created a Node
add a child
delete the child
DataNode.getChildren() returns empty set.



After fix DataNode.getChildren() should return empty set in all the above cases.
