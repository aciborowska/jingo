I quote:

void registerAndConnect(SocketChannel sock, InetSocketAddress addr)
throws IOException 
{
sockKey = sock.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT);
boolean immediateConnect = sock.connect(addr);
if (immediateConnect)
{ sendThread.primeConnection(); }

}

In the immediate case, there are several bugs:

a) updateSocketAddresses() is never called, as it is when the select-loop in doTransport(). This means that clientCnxnSocket.getRemoteSocketAddress() will return null for the lifetime of this socket?
b) CONNECT still in the interest set for the socket.
c) updateLastSendAndHeard() is never called either.
