Three issues with RPM package building, 

The install stage was removing BUILDROOT content:

[rpm] + rm -rf /tmp/zkpython_build_rpm/BUILD

Since BUILD and BUILDROOT are actually the same folder, everything is
removed before being used.

The original fix for this problem  was submitted by CÃ©dric Lejeune

The other two issues that need to be fixed are an invalid argument given to popd and a reference to old redhat RPM packaging scripts.
