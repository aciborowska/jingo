As discussed during the 10/23 meeting, one issue we have in debugging ZK client logs with HBase is that we have a hard time following the flow of events. It may be obvious for a ZK dev, but in our POV that kind of trace isn't very intuitive:


2009-09-27 15:41:10,776 INFO org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn: Attempting connection to server ...
2009-09-27 15:41:10,776 INFO org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn: Priming connection to java.nio.channels.SocketChannel[connected local=/ ... remote=...
2009-09-27 15:41:10,776 INFO org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn: Server connection successful 
2009-09-27 15:41:10,784 WARN org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn: Exception closing session 0x0 to sun.nio.ch.SelectionKeyImpl@2c9b42e6



This excerpt is just an example. We would like to see something like a numbering of the events and possibly, in the case of an exception, at which point did it went wrong and what's the next step.
