Currently fsync.warningthresholdms property can be set as a Java system property. But it would help if this property can be made configurable through zoo.cfg so that configuration management tools can leverage it. Also the Java system property name should be standardized (refer ZOOKEEPER-2316) so that the property is inline with the standard followed by other properties.
