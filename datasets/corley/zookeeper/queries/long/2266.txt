I would like to propose integration of JaCoCo coverage library with ZooKeeper.

Purposes

	To find poorly covered methods, and improve JUnit testcases to cover them
	To estimate causes of flaky testcases (e.g. ZOOKEEPER-2080, ZOOKEEPER-2252, ZOOKEEPER-1868) by comparing reports from succeeded experiments and failed ones (I'm recently interested in how we can systematically realize this.)



Advantages of JaCoCo

	Support recent JDKs (including JDK 8)
	Low overhead
	Released under EPL
	
		Note: cobertura has been removed from the code base because it is released under GPL ( ZOOKEEPER-75, http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x )
	
	




Usage

$ ant test #(plus optionally, -Dtestcase=.. -Dtest.method=..)
$ ant jacoco-report
$ x-www-browser build/test/jacoco/reports/index.html &

Example: jacoco-report-example.zip

Possible Future Work

	Integrate to Jenkins buildbot so that we can check coverage after each of builds
