After building the deb package it is not installable because of missing dependencies in the control file. 

Path:
src/packages/deb/zookeeper.control/control

If I remember correctly the package 'sun-java6-jre' is no longer provided by Ubuntu.

If it is possible to run zookeeper in openjdk the correct string in the control file should be:

"Depends: openjdk-6-jre"
Or 
"Depends: openjdk-7-jre"
