Currently zookeeper have the feature of limiting the maximum number of connection/client  per IP or Host (maxClientCnxns).

But to safe guard zookeeper server from DoS attack due to many clients from different IPs,  it is better to have a limit of total number of connections/clients to a a single member of the ZooKeeper ensemble as well.

So the idea is to introduce a new configuration to limit the maximum number of total connections/clients.

Please share your thoughts.
