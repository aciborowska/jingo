I tried running "make run-check" on the cppunit tests, and got the following error:


tests/TestOperations.cc:270: Assertion: equality assertion failed [Expected: 1, Actual : 0]
tests/TestOperations.cc:339: Assertion: assertion failed [Expression: timeMock==zh->last_recv]
tests/TestOperations.cc:407: Assertion: equality assertion failed [Expected: 1, Actual : 0]
tests/TestOperations.cc:212: Assertion: equality assertion failed [Expected: -7, Actual : 0]



I thought this might be an environment issue, but I was able to reproduce it on both Ubuntu 12.04 and OpenSUSE 12.1
