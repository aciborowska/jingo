	DataTree members scount, initialized and method listACLEquals are never used
	transform if(!C) B else A to if(C) A else B (removes one indirection to follow for the brain)
	remove unused imports and one annotation
	add method getApproximateDataSize to DataNode (I work towards an immutable DataNode without public properties)
	move assignments (lastPrefix = getMaxPrefixWithQuota(path)) out of if statements
	combine nested if statements: if A if B then C => if A && B => C
	make ACL maps private and add getAclSize() to hide implementation details of the ACLs.
