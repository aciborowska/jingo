I'm running Zookeeper inside an Eclipse application.  When I launch the application from inside Eclipse I use the following arguments:

-Dzoodiscovery.autoStart=true
-Dzoodiscovery.flavor=zoodiscovery.flavor.centralized=localhost

This causes the application to start its own ZooKeeper server inside the JVM/application.  It immediately goes into a runaway state.  The name of the runaway thread is "NIOServerCxn.Factory:0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181".  When I suspend this thread, the CPU usage returns to 0.  Here is a stack trace from that thread when it is suspended:

EPollArrayWrapper.epollWait(long, int, long, int) line: not available [native method]	
EPollArrayWrapper.poll(long) line: 215	
EPollSelectorImpl.doSelect(long) line: 77	
EPollSelectorImpl(SelectorImpl).lockAndDoSelect(long) line: 69	
EPollSelectorImpl(SelectorImpl).select(long) line: 80	
NIOServerCnxn$Factory.run() line: 232	

Any ideas what might be going wrong?

Thanks.
