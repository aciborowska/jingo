Some systems are seeing test failures under concurrent execution.  This issue proposes to change the default test.junit.threads to 1 so that those environments continue to get consistent test runs.  Jenkins and individual developer environments can set multiple threads with a command line argument, so most environments will still get the benefit of faster test runs.
