Update the zkEnv.cmd script to not override ZOOCFGDIR, ZOO_LOG_DIR, or ZOO_LOG4J_PROP if they have already been set. This would match the functionality that currently exists in zkEnv.sh.

Also, add the ability to set the config file name using the ZOOCFG environment variable. This would match functionality that currently exists in zkEnv.sh.
