zookeeperAdmin guide have following description for traceFile property

traceFile
(Java system property: requestTraceFile)
If this option is defined, requests will be will logged to a trace file named traceFile.year.month.day.
Use of this option provides useful debugging information, but will impact performance. (Note: The system property has no zookeeper prefix, and the configuration variable name is different from the system property. Yes - it's not consistent, and it's annoying.)


But this property is used no where  in the whole ZooKeeper code.    it should be removed from documentation
