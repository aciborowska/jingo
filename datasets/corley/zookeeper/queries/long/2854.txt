The fatjar in 3.4.10 contains signature parts (META-INF/BCKEY.DSA and META-INF/BCKEY.SF). As a result it is not runnable

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.SecurityException: Invalid signature file digest for Manifest main attributes

deleting these from the jar solves the issue.
zip -d contrib/fatjar/-fatjar.jar 'META-INF/.SF' 'META-INF/*.DSA'

As far as i know a jar is signed all or nothing.
