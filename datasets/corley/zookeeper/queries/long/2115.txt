while testing single user mode that the initialize command succeeds even though it didn't in case of permission errors on the data directory:

....
+ exec /usr/lib/zookeeper/bin/zkServer-initialize.sh --myid=1
mkdir: cannot create directory `/var/lib/zookeeper/version-2': Permission denied
mkdir: cannot create directory `/var/lib/zookeeper/version-2': Permission denied
/usr/lib/zookeeper/bin/zkServer-initialize.sh: line 112: /var/lib/zookeeper/myid: Permission denied
