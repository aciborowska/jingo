LearnerHandler.syncFollower() has a comment like below:

When leader election is completed, the leader will set its
lastProcessedZxid to be (epoch < 32). There will be no txn associated
with this zxid.

However, IIUC, the expression "epoch < 32" (comparison) should be "epoch << 32" (bitshift).

Of course the error is very trivial but it was a little bit confusing for me, so I'd like to fix it.
