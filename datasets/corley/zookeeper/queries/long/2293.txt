In https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/zookeeper/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/ZooKeeperServer.java
If readOnly flag is not being sent it gets logged as warning. Since we have enabled warning, the server gets filled up with messages like

Btw, readonly is optional and introduced later (http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ZooKeeper/GSoCReadOnlyMode),


015-08-14T11:03:11+00:00 Connection request from old client /192.168.24.16:14479; will be dropped if server is in r-o mode
...
2015-08-14T11:21:56+00:00 Connection request from old client 
2015-08-14T11:18:40+00:00 Connection request from old client /192.168.24.14:12135; will be dropped if server is in r-o mode
2015-08-14T11:19:40+00:00 Connection request from old client /192.168.24.14:12310; will be dropped if server is in r-o mode



we are just forced to send read-only flag which is optional to avoid wrong logging level chosen by zookeeper.

       boolean readOnly = false;
        try {
            readOnly = bia.readBool("readOnly");
            cnxn.isOldClient = false;
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // this is ok -- just a packet from an old client which
            // doesn't contain readOnly field
            LOG.warn("Connection request from old client "
                    + cnxn.getRemoteSocketAddress()
                    + "; will be dropped if server is in r-o mode");
        }



Suggest to demote the same to DEBUG as its not intended to warn in anyway.
