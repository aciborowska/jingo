We already have 2 maven profiles:

	full build - builds and tests everything, including contrib, c-client
	java-build - only builds and tests java server, client and recipes



For the PR test run, we should add a third one, that excludes contrib from the full-build profile. 

As Enrico suggested, we could have seperate jobs for testing C and Java:

	test java -> run with java-build profile
	test C -> run with newly added c-client profile
