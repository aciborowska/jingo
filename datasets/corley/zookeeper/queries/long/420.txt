Currently you cannot just build and test the zkpython contrib, you need to actually install the zookeeper client c library as well
as the zkpython lib itself.

There really needs to be 2 steps:

1) build/test zkpython "encapsulated" within the src repository, there should be no requirement to actually install anything
(this is esp the case for automated processes and for review by PMC during release time for example)
2) build an egg that can be distributed/installed by end user
