We are using Kafka which uses zookeeper. But we are not using SASL. So we keep on getting 


CRITICAL: Found 32 lines (limit=1/1): (1) 2016-12-16 07:02:14.780 [INFO ] [r] org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn [] - Opening socket connection to server 10.0.1.47/10.0.1.47:2181. Will not attempt to authenticate using SASL (unknown error)



Found http://stackoverflow.com/a/26532778/2235567

Looked and found this based on the above https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/zookeeper/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/client/ZooKeeperSaslClient.java

Searched for "Will not attempt to authenticate using SASL" and found the "unknown error".

Can the message be changed so that the word error is not there as it is not really an error?
