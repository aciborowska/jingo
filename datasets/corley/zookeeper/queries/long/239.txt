It would be nice to have real system tests. Our current Java system tests start everything in the same JVM. It would be nice to be able to start up the servers on different machines.

The C tests have a system test with a script to start and stop the cluster. It would be good to extend the script and to make it used by the Java tests as well.

If we can standardize on the script, we can have script options for different cluster shells from simple ssh to torque.
