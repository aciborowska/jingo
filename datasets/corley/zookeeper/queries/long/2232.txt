First some background here:
Around 6 months ago I had some bug fixes I wanted patched in zkperl, which I had been using through CPAN. I volunteered to take over maintenance of the code, and Chris Darroch set me up with permissions to push new releases to CPAN. At the time I was unaware that Net::ZooKeeper was bundled with the rest of the ZooKeeper code, and hadn't reached out to any other ZooKeeper devs.

Since that time there have been a few CPAN releases, which included some feature requests from users(#1, #2), bug fixes(#3, #5) and test failure fixes.

I'd love for zkperl to be kept in sync with CPAN releases, and to have other ZooKeeper devs approve feature requests from users. Is there any preferred process for keeping these distributions in sync?

I don't currently have any specific ideas. I mainly wanted to start the conversation here, with other devs.
