When the client constructs ZooKeeper object, it will record the basic info in log. But its sessionTimeout may be inaccurate if it's not equal to negotiationSessionTimeout. Can we change the description of this info? 


    public ZooKeeper(String connectString, int sessionTimeout, Watcher watcher)
        throws IOException
    {
        LOG.info("Initiating client connection, connectString=" + connectString
                + " sessionTimeout=" + sessionTimeout + " watcher=" + watcher);

        watchManager.defaultWatcher = watcher;
        cnxn = new ClientCnxn(connectString, sessionTimeout, this, watchManager);
        cnxn.start();
    }
