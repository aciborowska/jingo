the following code is missing conditional log call based on result of remove call (size > 0)

    // XXX This shouldn't be needed, but just in case
>     synchronized (existWatches) 
{
>         addTo(existWatches.remove(path), result);
>         LOG.warn("We are triggering an exists watch for delete! Shouldn't happen!");
>     }
>
