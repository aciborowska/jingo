------------------------------------------------------------
Possible improvements:

Default host list to localhost:2181 when not given.

Don't print a ton of debug, it looks like both cli_mt and zkCli.sh does this. Make a simple ls that lists subnodes one line at a time and a simple cat that lists only the node content, simple put etc.

Shell with gnu readline capabilities and tab completion on node names would be a big improvement of usability during testing and debugging.
