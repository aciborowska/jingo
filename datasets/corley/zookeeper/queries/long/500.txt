Async methods like asyncLedgerCreate and Open shouldnt be throwing InterruptedException and BKExceptions. 

The present method signatures lead to messy application code since one is forced to have error handling code in 2 places: inside the callback to handler a non-OK return code, and outside for handling the exceptions thrown by the call. 

There should be only one way to indicate error conditions, and that should be through a non-ok return code to the callback.
