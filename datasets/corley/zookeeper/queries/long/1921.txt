I did not see this behavior with 3.4.5. When I upgraded to 3.4.6, couldn't establish quorum any more - what I found was that the listener on :3888 was only running on 127.0.0.1.

I was able to work around it by forcing dns to get the external hostnames, or removing 'my' hostname from /etc/hosts.

Key point - this appears to be a significant change in behavior from 3.4.5 - which I did not have any problems with... 

I know you can specify the clientPortAddress - is there any way in the configuration to specify which address should be used for quorum connection listeners - or to force it to listen on 0.0.0.0 for quorum connections?
