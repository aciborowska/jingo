ZooKeeper currently can limit connection count from clients coming from the same ip. It is a great feature to malfunctioning clients DOS-ing the server with many requests.

I propose additional safegurads for ZooKeeper. 
It would be great if optionally connection count could be limited for a specific user or a specific user on an ip.
This is great in cases where ZooKeeper ensemble is shared by multiple users and these users share the same client ips. This can be common in container based cloud deployment where external ip of multiple clients can be the same.
