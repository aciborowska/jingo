Environment:
 I deploy ZooKeeper in a cluster of three nodes. Each node has three network interfaces(eth0, eth1, eth2).

Hostname is used instead of IP address in zoo.cfg, and quorumListenOnAllIPs=true

Probleam:
 I start three ZooKeeper servers( node A, node B, and node C) one by one, 
 when the leader election finishes, node B is the leader. 
 Then I shutdown one network interface of node A by command "ifdown eth0". The ZooKeeper server on node A will lost connection to node B and node C. In my test, I will take about 20 minites that the ZooKeepr server of node A realizes the event and try to call the QuorumServer.recreateSocketAddress the resolve the hostname.

I try to read the source code, and I find the code in
QuorumCnxManager.java:

    class RecvWorker extends ZooKeeperThread {
        Long sid;
        Socket sock;
        volatile boolean running = true;
        final DataInputStream din;
        final SendWorker sw;

        RecvWorker(Socket sock, DataInputStream din, Long sid, SendWorker sw) {
            super("RecvWorker:" + sid);
            this.sid = sid;
            this.sock = sock;
            this.sw = sw;
            this.din = din;
            try {
                // OK to wait until socket disconnects while reading.
                sock.setSoTimeout(0);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                LOG.error("Error while accessing socket for " + sid, e);
                closeSocket(sock);
                running = false;
            }
        }
       ...
     }


I notice that the soTime is set to 0 in RecvWorker constructor. I think this is reasonable when the IP address of a ZooKeeper server never change, but considering that the IP address of each ZooKeeper server may change, maybe we should better set a timeout here.

I think this isÂ a problem.
