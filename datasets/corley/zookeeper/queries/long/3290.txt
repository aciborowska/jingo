Assume we execute the follow statements


ZooKeeper zk = ...;
zk.multi(Arrays.asList(
  Op.check(path1, -1),
  Op.delete(path2, -1)));



If path1 or path2 didn't exist, we got an exception KeeperException.NoNodeException without which of them doesn't exist.

The reason is when we executed PrepRequestProccessor#pRequest in PrepRequestProccessor#L804, it processed KeeperException.NoNodeException which contained path info.

However, we generated ErrorTxn which only contains err field represented error code and lost path info. Maybe a reasonable resolution is extend ErrorTxn to contain path info or a general data byte array.
