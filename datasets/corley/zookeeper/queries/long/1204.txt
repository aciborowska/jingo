The calls to ZooTrace are kind of verbose and contain duplicated logic. This patch makes the calls as short as possible so that they do not distract that much from what's actually going on.
Calls to LOG.isTraceEnabled() are removed at many places, because this check is done anyways inside ZooTracer. At some places it has been left, to avoid costly message creation.
