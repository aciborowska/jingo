In org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeper.ZKWatchManager#materialize(), even if the defaultWatcher is null, it is still be added into the Set and returned. This would cause a lot of annoying error log at org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn.EventThread#processEvent as below:
       2014-11-21 15:21:23,279 - ERROR - [main-EventThread:ClientCnxn$EventThread@524] - Error while calling watcher
       java.lang.NullPointerException
           at org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn$EventThread.processEvent(ClientCnxn.java:522)
           at org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn$EventThread.run(ClientCnxn.java:498)

It can be simply fixed by having a null check in ZKWatchManager.
