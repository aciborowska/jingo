One of our users has observed that an ephemeral znode had gone away once its creator had disconnected according to the leader, but one follower believed that it existed long after the znode had been deleted. Apparently the follower was never going to delete it. Because the leader wouldn't recognize the znode as an existing one, any attempt to delete the znode failed.  We have to investigate if this is related to any known bug, although, to my knowledge, this is the first time it happens. It is important to note that the user was running an older version of our code.
