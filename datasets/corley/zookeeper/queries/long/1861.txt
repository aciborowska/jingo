queueSendMap is a ConcurrentHashMap.
At line 210:

            if (!queueSendMap.containsKey(sid)) {
                queueSendMap.put(sid, new ArrayBlockingQueue<ByteBuffer>(
                        SEND_CAPACITY));


By the time control enters if block, there may be another concurrent put with same sid to the ConcurrentHashMap.
putIfAbsent() should be used.

Similar issue occurs at line 307 as well.
