Use case in HBase is that we need to recursively delete multiple subtrees:

    ZKUtil.deleteChildrenRecursively(watcher, acquiredZnode);
    ZKUtil.deleteChildrenRecursively(watcher, reachedZnode);
    ZKUtil.deleteChildrenRecursively(watcher, abortZnode);


To achieve high consistency, it is desirable to use multi for the above operations.

This JIRA adds support for recursive deletion in multi.
