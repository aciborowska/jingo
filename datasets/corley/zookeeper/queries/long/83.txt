Maven is a great too for building java projects at the ASF.  It helps standardize the build a bit since it's a convention oriented.
It's dependency auto downloading would remove the need to store the dependencies in svn, and it will handle many of the suggested ASF policies like gpg signing of the releases and such.

The ZooKeeper build is almost vanilla except for the jute compiler bits.  Things that would need to change are:

	re-organize the source tree a little so that it uses the maven directory conventions
	seperate the jute bits out into seperate modules so that a maven plugin can be with it
