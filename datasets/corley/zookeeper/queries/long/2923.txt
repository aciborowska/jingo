The comment of the  variable matchSyncs in class CommitProcessor says:




    /**
     * This flag indicates whether we need to wait for a response to come back from the
     * leader or we just let the sync operation flow through like a read. The flag will
     * be true if the CommitProcessor is in a Leader pipeline.
     */
    boolean matchSyncs;



I search the source code and find that matchSyncs will be false if  the CommitProcessor is in a Leader pipeline, and it will be true if the CommitProcessor  is in a Follower pipeline.
Therefore I think the comment should be modified to match the code.
