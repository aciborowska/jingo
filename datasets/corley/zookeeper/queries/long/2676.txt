Sometimes it's useful to be able to run a unit test from the CLI and then attach an IDE to enable debugging as below:


$ ant -Dtestcase=FourLetterWordsTest -DremoteDebug=true test-core-java



The unit test will stop as below:


(...)
junit.run-concurrent:
     [echo] Running 1 concurrent JUnit processes.     
    [junit] Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005



And we will be able to put breakpoints on the target class and bind the IDE to it's process to step through the test.
