Currently, if ZooKeeper delete a znode that does not exist. It throws a KeeperException.NoNodeException without path message. It causes difficulty when user debug with ZooKeeper. For example,

Assume we try to do a transaction(with Curator encapsulation)



client.inTransaction()
   .check().forPath(path1).and()
   .delete().forPath(path2).and()
   .commit()




if the statement throw an exception KeeperException.NoNodeException without path information, we can hardly know that it failed at check or delete.

Thus I propose throws KeeperException with path in DataTree operations. We can achieve this without burden.
