The SyncRequestProcessor flushes writes to disk either when 1000 writes are pending to be flushed or when the processor fails to retrieve another write from its incoming queue. The "flush when queue empty" condition operates poorly under many workloads as it can quickly degrade into flushing after every write – losing all benefits of batching and leading to a continuous stream of flushes + fsyncs which overwhelm the underlying disk.
 
A configurable flush delay would ensure flushes do not happen more frequently than once every X milliseconds. This can be used in-place of or jointly with batch size triggered flushes.
