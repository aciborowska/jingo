In FinalRequestProcessor.java#processRequest we have:


     if (request.isQuorum()) {
                zks.getZKDatabase().addCommittedProposal(request);
     }



but this is only useful to the leader since committed proposals are only used from LearnerHandler to sync up followers. I presume followers do need it as they might become a leader at any point. But observers have no need for them, so we could probably special case this for them and optimize the path for them.
