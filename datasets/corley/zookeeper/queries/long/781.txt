A connection strategy allows control over the way that ZooKeeper clients (we would implement this for both c and java apis) connect to a serving ensemble. Today we have two strategies, randomized round robin (default) and ordered round robin, both of which are hard coded into the client implementation. We would generalize this interface and allow users to create their own.
