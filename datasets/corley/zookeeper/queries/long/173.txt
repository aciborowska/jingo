For lack of better term, I'm adding a section to the programmer's guide called "Miscellaneous Operations".  This might eventually be broken out into sections of more descriptive terms. In short, these are COMMON zookeeper programming operations that do not come under the headings of connecting, reading, writing, or watching.  

(I don't think we should document uncommon or seldom used API here.)
