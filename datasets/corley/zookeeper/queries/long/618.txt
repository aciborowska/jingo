See
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/view/ZooKeeper/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/612/
this test failed however there is no indication in the hudson page why it failed.

Looking at the raw console output I see

    [junit] Running org.apache.zookeeper.test.QuorumTest
    [junit] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Time elapsed: 0 sec
    [junit] Test org.apache.zookeeper.test.QuorumTest FAILED (timeout)

So it seems there is an error in hudson reporting.

Giri can you look into this?
