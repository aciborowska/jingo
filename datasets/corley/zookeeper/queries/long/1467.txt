Server principal on client side is derived using hostname.

org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn.SendThread.startConnect()

           try {
                zooKeeperSaslClient = new ZooKeeperSaslClient("zookeeper/"+addr.getHostName());
            }



This may have problems when admin wanted some customized principals like zookeeper/clusterid@HADOOP.COM where clusterid is the cluster identifier but not the host name.

IMO, server principal also should be configurable as hadoop is doing.
