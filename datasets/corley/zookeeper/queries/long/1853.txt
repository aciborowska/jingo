Execute the following command in zkCli.sh :

create /contacts/1  
{"country":"CA","name":"De La Salle"}

The results is that only {"id":1,"fullname":"De is stored.
The expected result is to have the full JSON payload stored.

The CREATE command seems to be croped after the first space of the data payload. When issuing a create command, all arguments not being -s nor -e shall be treated as the actual data.
