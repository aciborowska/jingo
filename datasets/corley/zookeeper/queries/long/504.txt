java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LedgerManagementProcessor$OpenLedgerOp cannot be cast to org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LedgerManagementProcessor$CloseLedgerOp
	at org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LedgerManagementProcessor.processResult(LedgerManagementProcessor.java:1083)

This seems to be happening because its a nested switch case statement. And the OPEN: case, doesn't ever call a break. It only calls a break from the inner switch-case and hence falls through into the CLOSE: case.
