If JAVA_HOME is not set,  zk startup and fetching status command execution result misleads user.

1. Eventhough zk startup has failed since JAVA_HOME is not set , on CLI it displays that zk STARTED.

#:~/Apr3rd/zookeeper-3.4.6/bin> ./zkServer.sh start
JMX enabled by default
Using config: /home/REX/Apr3rd/zookeeper-3.4.6/bin/../conf/zoo.cfg
Starting zookeeper ... STARTED



2.  Fetching zk status when JAVA_HOME is not set displays that process not running .

#:~/Apr3rd/zookeeper-3.4.6/bin> ./zkServer.sh status
JMX enabled by default
Using config: /home/REX/Apr3rd/zookeeper-3.4.6/bin/../conf/zoo.cfg
Error contacting service. It is probably not running.
