ZooKeeper currently uses Jute to serialize objects to put on the wire and on disk. We pulled Jute out of Hadoop and added a C binding. Both versions of Jute have evolved (although Hadoop still doesn't have a C binding). It would be nice to use a more standard serialization library. Some options include Thrift or Google's protocol buffers.

Our main requirements would be Java and C bindings and good performance. (For example, serializing to XML would give us incredibly bad performance and would not be acceptible!)
