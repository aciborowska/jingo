I'm working on using ZooKeeper for an internal application at Digg.  I've been using the zkpython package and I just noticed that the data I was receiving from a zookeeper.get() call was being truncated.  After some quick digging I found that zookeeper.c limits the data returned to 512 characters (see http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/zookeeper/tags/release-3.2.2/src/contrib/zkpython/src/c/zookeeper.c?view=markup line 855).

Is there a reason for this?  The only information regarding node size that I've read is that it should not exceed 1MB so this limit seems a bit arbitrary and restrictive.

Thanks for the great work!
