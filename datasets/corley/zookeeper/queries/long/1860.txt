This was caught by Camille Fournier, the async versions of reconfig in the Java client don't actually throw KeeperException nor InterruptedException. Since this is unreleased code (i.e.: for 3.5.0) I don't think there are issues with changing the API (that is, considering what exceptions are thrown part of the API).
