Hi Nigel can you take a look at this?

Following you'll see the email I got, notice that the patch is patch 908, however if you look at the hudson page it's linked to the change is documented as 909 patch file applied
https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-Build/25/changes

I looked at both jiras ZOOKEEPER-908 and ZOOKEEPER-909 both of these look good (the right names on patches) and qabot actually updated 908 with the comment (failure). However the "change" is listed as 909 which is wrong.
