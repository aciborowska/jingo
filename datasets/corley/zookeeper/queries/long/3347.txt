There is a bunch of synchronization that occurs in the PathTrie.  Each node in the tree requires a lock to view its children, so to traverse a tree that is 8 nodes deep, it is required to lock 8 different times.  Also, I'm not really sure that the locking is consistent; a node deep in the tree can be negatively impacted by another thread deleting the node's parent at the same time.
