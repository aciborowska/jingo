FinalRequestProcessor has this code block:

            if (request.getHdr() != null) {
               ... SNIP ...
            }
            // do not add non quorum packets to the queue.
            if (request.isQuorum()) {
                zks.getZKDatabase().addCommittedProposal(request);
            }



Both conditions are equivalent so the two if blocks could actually be merged to one block.
