Our current log4j log rolling policy (for ROLLINGFILE) doesn't cap the max logging space used. This can be a problem in production systems. See similar improvements recently made in hadoop: HADOOP-8149

For ROLLINGFILE only, I believe we should change the default threshold to INFO and cap the max space to something reasonable, say 5g (max file size of 256mb, max file count of 20). These will be the defaults in log4j.properties, which you would also be able to override from the command line.
