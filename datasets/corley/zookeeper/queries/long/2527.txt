Connection watch is not getting cleared when watch is created as part of get and it is fired as part of set and client is closed
Steps to reproduce:-

Configure the Zookeeper in ssl mode and start the same
connect to zookeeper using ./zkCli.sh
Check the watch status as zero.
set watch as below :-
get -w /test
Check the watch it is like below:-
BLR1000007042:/home/Rakesh/Zookeeper/18_Aug/zookeeper-3.5.1-alpha/bin # echo wchs | netcat 10.18.101.80 2181
1 connections watching 1 paths
Total watches:1
let the watch fire as part of below-
set /test hello
Here watch is fired when set is done
Close the client
Check for the watch. It is not zero but 1
BLR1000007042:/home/Rakesh/Zookeeper/18_Aug/zookeeper-3.5.1-alpha/bin # echo wchs | netcat 10.18.101.80 2181
1 connections watching 0 paths
Total watches:0
If we repeat again and again it will keep increasing.
Tried without SSL mode and it is working fine in that mode.
