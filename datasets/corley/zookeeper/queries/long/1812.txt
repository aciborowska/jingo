Steps to reproduce:


	Connect to localhost:2181 when ZooKeeper server is down. After a few seconds, ZooInspector warns that the connection has failed
	start the ZooKeeper server
	Reconnect to localhost:2181, ZooInspector will still not be able to connect to the server.



The workaround is to relaunch ZooInspector.
