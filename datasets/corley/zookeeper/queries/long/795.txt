Hi,

I notice a problem with the eventThread located in ClientCnxn.java file.
The eventThread isn't shutdown after a connection "session expired" event coming (i.e. never receive EventOfDeath).

When a session timeout occurs and the session is marked as expired, the connexion is fully closed (socket, SendThread...) expect for the eventThread.
As a result, if i create a new zookeeper object and connect through it, I got a zombi thread which will never be kill (as for the previous zookeeper object, the state is already close, calling close again don't do anything).

So everytime I will create a new zookeeper connection after a expired session, I will have a one more zombi EventThread.

How to reproduce :

	Start a zookeeper client connection in debug mode
	Pause the jvm enough time to the expired event occur
	Watch for example with jvisualvm the list of threads, the sendThread is succesfully killed, but the EventThread go to wait state for a infinity of time
	if you reopen a new zookeeper connection, and do again the previous steps, another EventThread will be present in infinite wait state
