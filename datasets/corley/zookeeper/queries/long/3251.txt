This will add three metric types:

AvgMinMaxCounterSet

AvgMinMaxPercentileCounter

AvgMinMaxPercentileCounterSet

The percentile metrics allow us to get a better sense of the latency distribution. They are more expensive than AvgMinMax counters and are restricted to latency measurements for now.

The counter set allows the grouping of metrics such as write per namespace, read per namespace.
