Jenkins build for windows cmake is failing:

started here:

https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/ZooKeeper/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-windows-cmake/2717/console

f:\jenkins\jenkins-slave\workspace\zookeeper-trunk-windows-cmake\src\c\src\hashtable\hashtable.h(6): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'winconfig.h': No such file or directory [F:\jenkins\jenkins-slave\workspace\ZooKeeper-trunk-windows-cmake\src\c\hashtable.vcxproj]
  hashtable.c

 

Looks like one or the other or both of these commits are at issue (jenkins build broken on these two changes being committed)

	ZOOKEEPER-3017: Link libm in CMake on FreeBSD. — hanm / detail
