The default log4j.properties has:

log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, CONSOLE

where the console appender is only outputting INFO level and above.

This is resulting in a large number of debug logs being generated, which are all filtered out by the console appender (by default there are no other appenders used)

We need to change the default rootLogger to INFO level, which will resolve this issue.

Users are free to change this of course â€“ most likely they would only do this when debugging an issue, and would not want to run in DEBUG in production (again, they are free to choose).
