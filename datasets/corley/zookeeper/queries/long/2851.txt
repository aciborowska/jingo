Some of the ZOOKEEPER-1045 unit tests were implemented as part of QuorumCnxManagerTest however, this class is only available in branch-3.4: it was introduced in ZOOKEEPER-1633 to cover upgrade path testing from 3.4 to 3.5, which is a feature not available in branch-3.5.

This task is to migrate ZOOKEEPER-1045 related tests in QuorumCnxManagerTest from branch-3.4 to branch-3.5.
