On windows, daemons can be installed as windows services during installation, so that they can be managed using the standard "service" commands and UI. 

For this, we have to generate an XML file describing the command line program, and arguments. We can add support for --service parameter passed to bin/zkServer.cmd so that it will output the XML for the service instead of running the command. 

Hadoop and HBase has the same syntax and mechanics (see https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/trunk/bin/hbase.cmd#L73)
