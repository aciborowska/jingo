Currently the zkServer.sh script will start zookeeper as the user invoking the script.

It would be good to add the ability to specify the user (maybe in a $USER variable in conf/zookeeper-env.sh) under which the zookeeper process should be run, so that any user invoking the script do not accidentally start it as their user (esp. as root).

Addition of this feature would make zkServer.sh the only script required to manage zookeeper process.

Thanks
