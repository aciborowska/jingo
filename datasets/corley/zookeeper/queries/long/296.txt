Per a recent discussion on the ZooKeeper users mailing list regarding the API/ABI change introduced in 3.1.0 by ZOOKEEPER-255, I would suggest going forwards that the project adopt the versioning and compatibility guidelines of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project.  These are well documented here:

http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html

I'd also suggest adopting the parallel installation procedure used by APR.  This would mean that, for example, as of version 4.0.0 the ZooKeeper C library would be installed as libzookeeper_mt-4.so and the include files would be installed as zookeeper-4/zookeeper.h, etc.

The namespace cleanup I suggest in ZOOKEEPER-295 would fit well with such a change.

I should also point out the (rather mysterious) intent of the GNU libtool versioning system for libraries; while many projects seem to disregard it, it does have some value:
