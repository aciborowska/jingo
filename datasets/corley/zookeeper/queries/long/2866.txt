When we run our Distributed system Model Checking (DMCK) in ZooKeeper v3.5.3
by following the workload in ZK-2778:

	initially start 2 ZooKeeper nodes
	start 3 new nodes and let them join the cluster
	do a reconfiguration where the newly joined will be PARTICIPANTS,
while the previous 2 nodes change to be OBSERVERS



We think our DMCK found this following bug:

	one of the newly joined node crashes due to
it receives an unexpected PROPOSAL message
from the new leader in the cluster.



For complete information of the bug, please see the document that is attached.
