I'm seeing this frequently:

     [exec] Zookeeper_simpleSystem::testPing : elapsed 18006 : OK
     [exec] Zookeeper_simpleSystem::testAcl : elapsed 1022 : OK
     [exec] Zookeeper_simpleSystem::testChroot : elapsed 3145 : OK
     [exec] Zookeeper_simpleSystem::testAuth ZooKeeper server started : elapsed 25687 : OK
     [exec] zktest-mt: /home/phunt/dev/workspace/gitzk/src/c/src/zookeeper.c:1952: zookeeper_process: Assertion `cptr' failed.
     [exec] make: *** [run-check] Aborted
     [exec] Zookeeper_simpleSystem::testHangingClient
