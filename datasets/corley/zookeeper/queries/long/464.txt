An application using BookKeeper is likely to use a large number of ledgers over time. Such an application might not need all ledgers created over time and might want to delete some of these ledgers to free up some space on bookies. The idea of this jira is to implement a procedure that enables an application to garbage-collect unwanted ledgers.

To garbage-collect a ledger, we need to delete the ledger metadata on ZooKeeper, and delete the ledger data on corresponding bookies.
