Recently I learned more about maxClientCnxns configuration and read the read the code of implement. I know now it's the limitation of the number of connection from the same ip.

But actually we may run multiple process in the same server. And if one process excesses the limitation of maxClientCnxns, all the ZooKeeper clients will fail to connect with ZooKeeper cluster. Can we fix that to make this limitation for each process?

Any suggestion is welcome.
