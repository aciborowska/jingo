Couple of issues listed on http://zookeeper.apache.org/
doc/r3.4.9/releasenotes.html that are either 'Open' or 'Patch available'. For example, issues were wrongly marked as "3.4.8" fix version in jira and has caused the trouble.

This jira to cross check all the jira issues present in the release note and check the correctness.
