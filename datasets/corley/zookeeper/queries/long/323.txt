in some benchmarks i noticed that you can get much higher throughput using preallocated files rather than doing the grow-by-padding approach that we use. we should recycle log files that are no longer needed. this should give us a performance boost. it will also make the purgelog utility unnecessary. we should have a policy that we only keep X snapshots and associated logs and reuse older log files (and probably delete the older snapshots as well since the snapshot would be useless without the corresponding log file.)
