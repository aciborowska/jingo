	getMyId() and getId() in QuorumPeer are doing the same thing
	QuorumPeer.quorumPeers is being read directly from outside QuorumPeer, although we have the getter QuorumPeers.getView().



The purpose of this cleanup is to later be able to change more easily the way QuorumPeer manages its list of peers (to support dynamic changes in this list).
