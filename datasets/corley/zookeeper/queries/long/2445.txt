I want to add a new node to a test cluster with three node. So I tried with the folling steps: 1. I copied one foller zookeeper directory, and edit clientPort, dataDir , logDir, myid file, and then add a new record server.newId=hostname:newPort:newEPort into zoo.cfg, for test I keep the leader configuration there and remove the other two configuration, I tested ,this failed. So I open the zoo.cfg , copied the lead configuration line just edit the serverId, and this should be a wrong configuration file as the server does not match with the serverid. But strangely , it successed.
