While compiling Bigtop on Fedora 25 we found that there is an issue with the autoconf detection of cppunit: See BIGTOP-2642 for error.

Some background regarding the issue can be found here: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1311694

The fedora maintainers encourage use of pkg-config rather crufty *.m4 autoconf magic by only supplying pkg-config files *.pc.

The patch is surprisingly easy but adds the additional requirement for pkg-config which should be available on every well maintained system for ages.

Please see for me proposed patch. Works for me for Fedora 25, Centos 6, MacOSX with HomeBrew.
