Affects C clients from 3.3 to trunk.

The Java client does not enforce ordering on ping requests. It merely updates fields when a ping reply is received and schedules a new ping request when necessary.

The C client actually enqueues the void response in the completion data structure and pulls it off when it gets a response.

This sounds like an implementation detail (and it is, sort of), but if a future server were to, say, send unsolicited ping replies to a client to assert liveness, it would work fine against a Java client but would cause a C client to fail the assertion in zookeeper_process, "assert(cptr)", line 2912, zookeeper.c.
