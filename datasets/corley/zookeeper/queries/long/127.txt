In QuorumCnxManager.toSend there is a call to create a connection as follows:
    channel = SocketChannel.open(new InetSocketAddress(addr, port));

Unfortunately "addr" is the ip address of a remote server while "port" is the electionPort of this server.
As an example, given this configuration (taken from my zoo.cfg)
  server.1=10.20.9.254:2881
  server.2=10.20.9.9:2882
  server.3=10.20.9.254:2883
Server 3 was observed trying to make a connection to host 10.20.9.9 on port 2883 and obviously failing.

In tests where all machines use the same electionPort this bug would not manifest itself.
