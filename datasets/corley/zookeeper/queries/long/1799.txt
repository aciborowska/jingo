org.apache.zookeeper.test.SaslAuthFailDesignatedClientTest.testAuth often fails on SUSE with the following error stack trace:

junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected [0x141ccb60d870000] expected:<1> but was:<0>
	at org.apache.zookeeper.test.JMXEnv.ensureAll(JMXEnv.java:115)

The reason is that this is a negative test. After authentication fails, the client connection is closed at the server side so does the session right before test case calls JMXEnv.ensureAll  to verify the session. Below are the log events show the sequence and you can see the session was already closed before client JMXEnv.ensureAll.
