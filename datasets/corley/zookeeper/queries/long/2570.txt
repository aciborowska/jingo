ZooKeeper clients are timed out when ZooKeeper servers are very busy. Clients throw below exception and fail all the pending operations

org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$ConnectionLossException: KeeperErrorCode = ConnectionLoss
	at org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException.create(KeeperException.java:99)


Clients log bellow information

2016-09-22 01:49:08,001 [myid:127.0.0.1:11228] - WARN  [main-SendThread(127.0.0.1:11228):ClientCnxn$SendThread@1181] - Client session timed out, have not heard from server in 13908ms for sessionid 0x20000d21b280000
2016-09-22 01:49:08,001 [myid:127.0.0.1:11228] - INFO  [main-SendThread(127.0.0.1:11228):ClientCnxn$SendThread@1229] - Client session timed out, have not heard from server in 13908ms for sessionid 0x20000d21b280000, closing socket connection and attempting reconnect


STEPS TO REPRODECE:

	Create multi operation

List<Op> ops = new ArrayList<Op>();
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            Op create = Op.create(rootNode + "/" + i, "".getBytes(), ZooDefs.Ids.OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE,
                    CreateMode.PERSISTENT);
            ops.add(create);
        }


Chose N in such a way that the total multi operation request  size is less than but near 1 MB.  For bigger request size increase jute.maxbuffer in servers
	Submit the multi operation request

 zooKeeper.multi(ops);
 
	After repeating above steps few times issue is reproduced
