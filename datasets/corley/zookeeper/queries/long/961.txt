Let's say you're using connection string "127.0.0.1:2182/foo".
1) put a childrenchanged watch on relative / (that is, on absolute path /foo)
2) stop the zk server
3) start the zk server
4) at this point, the client recovers the connection, and should have put back a watch on relative path /, but instead the client puts a watch on the absolute path /

	if some other client adds or removes a node under /foo, nothing will happen
	if some other client adds or removes a node under /, then you will get an error from the zk client library (string operation error)
