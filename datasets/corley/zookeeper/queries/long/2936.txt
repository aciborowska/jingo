Recent versions of ZooKeeper have introduced the following duplicate keys in to the contrib log4j.properties files.

In this file:


./zookeeper-3.4.8/contrib/rest/conf/log4j.properties


and this file:


./zookeeper-3.4.8/src/contrib/rest/conf/log4j.properties



the following duplicate keys are found:



log4j.appender.ROLLINGFILE.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.ROLLINGFILE.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} - %-5p [%t:%C{1}@%L] - %m%n



This was discovered because I've written file validators for most major formats which recurse all my github repos and this was failing my integration tests when pulling ZooKeeper source code. I actually added --exclude and --ignore-duplicate-keys switches to 

validate_ini.py

 to work around this and fix my builds for now but just remembered to raise this to you guys.

The validator tools if you're interested can be found at:
