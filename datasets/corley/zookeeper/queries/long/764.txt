In ZOOKEEPER-690, we noticed that an observer was being elected, and Henry proposed a patch to fix the issue. However, it seems that the patch does not solve the issue one user (Alan Cabrera) has observed. Given that we would like to fix this issue, and to work separately with Alan to determine the problem with his setup, I'm creating this jira and re-posting Henry's patch.
