to configure a machine to be an observer you must add a peerType=observer to the configuration file and an observer tag to the server list. this is redundant. if the observer tag is on the entry of a machine it should know it is an observer without needing the peerType tag.

on the other hand, do we really need the observers in the server list? they don't vote.
