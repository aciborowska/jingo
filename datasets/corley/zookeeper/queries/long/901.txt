QuorumCnxManager manages TCP connections between ZooKeeper servers for leader election in replicated mode. We have identified over time a couple of deficiencies that we would like to fix. Unfortunately, fixing these issues requires a little more than just generating a couple of small patches. More specifically, I propose, based on previous discussions with the community, that we reimplement QuorumCnxManager so that we achieve the following:


	Establishing connections should not be a blocking operation, and perhaps even more important, it shouldn't prevent the establishment of connections with other servers;
	Using a pair of threads per connection is a little messy, and we have seen issues over time due to the creation and destruction of such threads. A more reasonable approach is to have a single thread and a selector.
