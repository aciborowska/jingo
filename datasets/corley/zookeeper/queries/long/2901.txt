In the code that determines the EphemeralType it is looking at the owner (which is the client ID or connection ID):

EphemeralType.java:

   public static EphemeralType get(long ephemeralOwner) {
       if (ephemeralOwner == CONTAINER_EPHEMERAL_OWNER) 
{
           return CONTAINER;
       }
       if (ephemeralOwner < 0) 
{
           return TTL;
       }
       return (ephemeralOwner == 0) ? VOID : NORMAL;
   }

However my connection ID is:

header.getClientId(): -720548323429908480

This causes the code to think this is a TTL Ephemeral node instead of a
NORMAL Ephemeral node.

This also explains why this is random - if my client ID is non-negative
then the node gets added correctly.
