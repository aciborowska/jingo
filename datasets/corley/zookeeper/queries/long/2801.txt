This is a follow-on for ZOOKEEPER-2617 (for which I only supplied a patch for branch-3.4), that addresses minor typos in master.  With a slight modification, the patch also applies against the branch-3.5 branch.

If folks are curious, the typos are spotted with the "spellintian" shipped with Debian's lintian package.
