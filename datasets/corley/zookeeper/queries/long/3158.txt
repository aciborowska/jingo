look at the source code in the ClientCnxnSocketNetty.connect(InetSocketAddress):



public void operationComplete(ChannelFuture channelFuture) throws Exception {
            // this lock guarantees that channel won't be assgined after cleanup().
            connectLock.lock();
                try {
                    //----------------------
                    sendThread.primeConnection();
                    //-----------------------
                    firstConnect.countDown();
                    LOG.info("channel is connected: {}", channelFuture.getChannel());
                } finally {
                    connectLock.unlock();
                }
            }
 });



firstConnect.countDown() will not be executed where sendThread.primeConnection() has thrown an exception,it should be put into finally code block.
