Inspired by the work of Eric Hauser .
I propose a C# Client that supports the current stable version of ZK 3.4.6.
It was built by using static code conversion tools followed by manual editing and C# implementations of java selector and other java constructs. 
A great measure was taken to follow the logic of the java version. In fact, the code is almost identical. Thus allowing easy evolution alongside the java version. 

Main features:

	fully .NET async, no explicit threads used
	all relevant unit tests have been converted and passing consistently
	Code is 100% CoreCLR compliant
	NuGet package is already integrated in Microsoft Project Orleans as the only open-source membership provider.
	Nuget package for recipes
