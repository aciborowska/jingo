I'm trying to configure a process with Hadoop security (Hive metastore server) to talk to ZooKeeper 3.4.2 with Kerberos authentication. In this scenario Hadoop controls the SASL configuration (org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.HadoopConfiguration), instead of setting up the ZooKeeper "Client" loginContext via jaas.conf and system property 

-Djava.security.auth.login.config

Using the Hadoop configuration would work, except that ZooKeeper client code expects the loginContextName to be "Client" while Hadoop security will use  "hadoop-keytab-kerberos". I verified that by changing the name in the debugger the SASL authentication succeeds while otherwise the login configuration cannot be resolved and the connection to ZooKeeper is unauthenticated. 

To integrate with Hadoop, the following in ZooKeeperSaslClient would need to change to make the name configurable:

     login = new Login("Client",new ClientCallbackHandler(null));
