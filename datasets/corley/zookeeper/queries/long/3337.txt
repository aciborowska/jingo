Maven assembly plugin configuration must specify tarLongFileMode of "posix", not "gnu".

Otherwise if the user or group id is too large the build will fail. For example:

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-assembly-plugin:3.1.0:single
(source-package) on project zookeeper: Execution source-package of goal
org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-assembly-plugin:3.1.0:single failed: user id '1754762210'
is too big ( > 2097151 ). -> [Help 1]


A very common problem, many other projects here have had to fix this.Â
