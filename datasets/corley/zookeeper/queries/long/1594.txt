We've seen an intermittent failure in one of the C client tests TestReconfig which was committed as part of ZOOKEEPER-1355.

The test that is failing is failing before any rebalancing algorithm is invoked. After inspecting this we've concluded it is a failure to properly seed the random number generator properly. This same problem was seen and solved on the Java client side so we just need to do something similar on the C client side.

The assertion:

Build/trunk/src/c/tests/TestReconfig.cc:571: Assertion: assertion failed [Expression: numClientsPerHost.at(i) >= lowerboundClientsPerServer(numClients, numServers)]
