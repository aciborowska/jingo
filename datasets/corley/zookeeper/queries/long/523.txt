In one of the scenarios, one of our users cleaned up the server database, upgraded the zookeeper servers to 3.* from 2.* and did not shut down there clients. The clients kept spinning since they couldnt find a server that was up to date. Though this was a mistake on the users side, but the spinning of clients caused more problems (like zookeeper server running out of file handles since the clients kept spinning throguh servers). In such a case we should shut down the clients since its this should never happen.
