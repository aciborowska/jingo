When I try to open zookeeper.sln the VS wants me to convert the project. While the convertion is taking place I'm getting a message:

"A file with the name: "[path]\zookeeper.vcxproj" already exists on disk.
Do you want to overwrite the project and its imported property sheets"

And after it I get next message with same text but it is about Cli.vxproj

No matter If I click yes or no the coverting process fails, both projects (Cli and zookeeper) are marked as unavailable.

If I close VS and open the zookeeper.sln once again it wants me to convert but now if I answer yes the projects are again unavailable but if I answer no the projects are available but are empty.
