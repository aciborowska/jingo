When running the Java client you frequently get messages like the following:

org.apache.zookeeper.client.ZooKeeperSaslClient SecurityException: java.lang.SecurityException: Unable to locate a login configuration occurred when trying to find JAAS configuration.

In cases where we don't want this configuration enabled, the logs get spammed with this message.  It's scope should lowered to debug/trace to prevent flooding logs.
