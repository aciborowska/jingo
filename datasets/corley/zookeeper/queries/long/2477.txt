The documentation tends to refer to the c cli shell when citing examples of how to interact with ZK, rather than using the Java cli shell. Given the Java cli is much better maintained and more featureful the docs should refer to that instead. Also the c cli was originally meant to be a sample/example of c client usage rather than a true cli tool.
