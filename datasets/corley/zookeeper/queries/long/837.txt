ZooKeeper instantiates ClientCnxn in its ctor with this and therefor builds a 
cyclic dependency graph between both objects. This means, you can't have the 
one without the other. So why did you bother do make them to separate classes 
in the first place?
ClientCnxn accesses ZooKeeper.state. State should rather be a property of 
ClientCnxn. And ClientCnxn accesses zooKeeper.get???Watches() in its method 
primeConnection(). I've not yet checked, how this dependency should be 
resolved better.
