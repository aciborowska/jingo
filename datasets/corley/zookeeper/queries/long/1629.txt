It seems that testTransactionLogCorruption is very flaky,for example fails here:

https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-jdk7/500/
https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-jdk7/502/
https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-jdk7/503/#showFailuresLink

also fails for older builds (no longer on the website), for example all builds from 381 to 399.
