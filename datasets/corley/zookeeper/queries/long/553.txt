Using zkpython with ZK 3.2.1 release:

  import zookeeper as z
  zh = z.init(...)
  z.state(zh)  # returns 3 == z.CONNECTED_STATE

	kill standalone ZK server
  z.state(zh)  # returns 0 == ???



The problem is that 0 is not a state defined by the C client's zookeeper.[ch]. Perhaps 0 should've been defined as something like DISCONNECTED_STATE? (Java's KeeperState.Disconnected is 0, if that matters.)

If the fix is to define 0 as a new state, changes will be needed to both the C client and zkpython. Not sure about other bindings.
