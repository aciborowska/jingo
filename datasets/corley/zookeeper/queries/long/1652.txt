When connecting to zookeeper, the client does a reverse dns lookup on the hostname.  In our environment, the reverse dns lookup takes 5 seconds to fail, causing zookeeper clients to connect slowly.

The reverse dns lookup occurs in ClientCnx in the calls to adr.getHostName()


            setName(getName().replaceAll("\\(.*\\)",
                    "(" + addr.getHostName() + ":" + addr.getPort() + ")"));
            try {
                zooKeeperSaslClient = new ZooKeeperSaslClient("zookeeper/"+addr.getHostName());
            } catch (LoginException e) {
