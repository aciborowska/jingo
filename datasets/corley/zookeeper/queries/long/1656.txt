"Import package" are missing for bundle org.apache.hadoop.zookeeper.

I am getting an exception running the Zookeeper server in an OSGi environment.

ZookeeperServerMain uses
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

But there is no import in MANIFEST.mf:
Import-Package: javax.management,org.apache.log4j,org.osgi.framework;v
 ersion="[1.4,2.0)",org.osgi.util.tracker;version="[1.1,2.0)"


I am sure that another missing package would be the subpackage of org.apache.log4j like org.apache.log4j.jmx.


Best, Florian
