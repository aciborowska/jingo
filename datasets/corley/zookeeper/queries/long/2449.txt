As per the current logic if a host has "UnknownHostException" during zookeeper client object connection and it is never refreshed after that. Incase host comes back, this class won't try to connect it back.

Ideally in StaticHostProvider.next we end of the list is reached then all of the host in connection string should be tested and refreshed again. That way incase host comes back and object stays for a longer duration, realtime status can be updated and client can take advantage of that

This also benefit the scenario defined https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2447
