For running these tests, I am following instructions on https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/systest/README.txt 

In Step 4, when I try to run java jar build/contrib/fatjar/zookeeper<version>-fatjar.jar systest org.apache.zookeeper.test.system.SimpleSysTest , it throws the following error,

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: junit/framework/TestCase

The problem is that zookeeper-dev-fatjar.jar does not contain the TestCase class.

Patrick Hunt suggested that adding <zipgroupfileset dir="${zk.root}/build/test/lib" includes="*.jar" /> to fatjar/build.xml should solve the problem and it does.
