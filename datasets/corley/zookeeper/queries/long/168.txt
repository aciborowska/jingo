There is a chapter in the ZooKeeper Programmer's Guide called: "Building Blocks: A Guide to ZooKeeper Operations" that currently contains no content.  The idea behind this section is document all the basic things you can do with the ZooKeeper API â€“ not every little detail, or even every call in the API, but the basics, like: how to connect to a server, how to read a node, how to write to a node, how to set a watch, etc. I will create a subtask for every section in this chapter.

I don't mind writing up the these sections, if I can get the information, whether its' by phone, email, im, etc.
