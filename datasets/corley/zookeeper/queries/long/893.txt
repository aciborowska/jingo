When ZooKeeper receives certain illegally formed messages on the internal communication port (:4181 by default), it's possible for ZooKeeper to enter an infinite loop which causes 100% cpu usage. It's related to ZOOKEEPER-427, but that patch does not resolve all issues.

from: src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/QuorumCnxManager.java 

the two affected parts:
===========
int length = msgLength.getInt();                                                        
if(length <= 0) {                                                                       
    throw new IOException("Invalid packet length:" + length);                           
} 
===========


===========
while (message.hasRemaining()) {                                                    
    temp_numbytes = channel.read(message);                                          
    if(temp_numbytes < 0) 
{                                                         
        throw new IOException("Channel eof before end");                            
    }
                                                                               
    numbytes += temp_numbytes;                                                      
}

how to replicate this bug:

perform an nmap portscan against your zookeeper server: "nmap -sV -n your.ip.here -p4181"
wait for a while untill you see some messages in the logfile and then you will see 100% cpu usage. It does not recover from this situation. With my patch, it does not occur anymore
