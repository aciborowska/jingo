I'm seeing some weird behavior running zk-latencies.py
http://github.com/phunt/zk-smoketest

don't know if it's related to zkbindings itself, but I ran valgrind to see if it noticed any issues. see attached.

afaict these issues are related to zkpython binding, however I'm not sure. I did run valgrind against the
zookeeper c library tests and these issues were not highlighted. So I'm thinking this is zkpython errors, however
I'm not 100% sure. 

Henry can you take a look?
