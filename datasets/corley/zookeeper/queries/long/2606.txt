            LOG.info("Setting authorizedID: " + userNameBuilder);
            ac.setAuthorizedID(userNameBuilder.toString());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            LOG.error("Failed to set name based on Kerberos authentication rules.");
        }


On one cluster, we saw the following:

2016-10-04 02:18:16,484 - ERROR [NIOServerCxn.Factory:0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181:SaslServerCallbackHandler@137] - Failed to set name based on Kerberos authentication rules.


It would be helpful if the log contains information about the IOException.
