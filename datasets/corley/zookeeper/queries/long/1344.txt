For example: 
I have created a ZooKeeper client with subtree as "10.18.52.144:2179/apps/X". Now just generated OP command for the creation of zNode "/myId". When the client creates the path "/myid", the ZooKeeper server is actually be creating the path as "/myid" instead of creating as "/apps/X/myid"

Expected output: zNode has to be created as "/apps/X/myid"
