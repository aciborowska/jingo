EAI_NODATA and EAI_ADDRFAMILY have been deprecated in FreeBSD. I'm getting this error:

src/zookeeper.c: In function `getaddrinfo_errno':
src/zookeeper.c:446: error: `EAI_NODATA' undeclared (first use in this function)
src/zookeeper.c:446: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
src/zookeeper.c:446: error: for each function it appears in.)
src/zookeeper.c: In function `getaddrs':
src/zookeeper.c:581: error: `EAI_ADDRFAMILY' undeclared (first use in this function)

I'll submit a patch.
