Hi,

Debian and Fedora have a patch fixing a compilation failure in ZkAdaptor.cc but it doesn't appear to be fixed in the upcoming version 3.5.0. This issue is similar to ZOOKEEPER-470 and ZOOKEEPER-1795.

The error is :

g++ -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I..   -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -I/home/ebourg/packaging/zookeeper/src/contrib/zktreeutil/../../c/include -I/home/ebourg/packaging/zookeeper/src/contrib/zktreeutil/../../c/generated -I../include -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/libxml2 -g -O2 -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security -MT ZkAdaptor.o -MD -MP -MF .deps/ZkAdaptor.Tpo -c -o ZkAdaptor.o ZkAdaptor.cc
ZkAdaptor.cc: In member function ‘void zktreeutil::ZooKeeperAdapter::reconnect()’:
ZkAdaptor.cc:220:21: error: ‘sleep’ was not declared in this scope
             sleep (1);



This is fixed by including unistd.h in ZkAdaptor.cc or  ZkAdaptor.h
