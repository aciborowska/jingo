It can be useful as a sysadmin to know the settings that were initially used to configure a given ZooKeeper server. Some of these can be read from the process logs and others from the java args in the process description but if, for example, the zoo.cfg file used when starting a process up is overwritten without the process itself being restarted then it can be difficult to know exactly what is currently being run on the jvm.

Produce admin commands (and four-letter commands) to answer these questions.
