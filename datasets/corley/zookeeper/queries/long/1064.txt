The zkServer.sh script kind of sort of implements the standard init.d style of interaction.

It lacks


	nice return codes




	status method




	standard output messages



See

It is an open question how much zkServer should use these LSB scripts because that may impair portability.  I
think it should produce similar messages, however, and should return standardized error codes.  If lsb functions
are available, I think that they should be used so that ZK works as a first class citizen.


I will produce a proposed patch.
