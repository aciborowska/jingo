When the lower 32bits of a zxid "roll over" (zxid is a 64 bit number, however the upper 32 are considered the epoch number) the epoch number (upper 32 bits) are incremented and the lower 32 start at 0 again.

This should work fine, however, afaict, in the current 3.4/3.5 the acceptedEpoch/currentEpoch files are not being updated for this case.

See ZOOKEEPER-335 for changes from 3.3 branch.
