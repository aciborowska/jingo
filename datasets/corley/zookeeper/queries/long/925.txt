See WHIRR-19 for some background.

In whirr we looked at a number of site/doc generation facilities. In the end Maven site generation plugin turned out to be by far the best option. You can see our nascent site here (no attempt at styling,etc so far):
http://incubator.apache.org/whirr/

In particular take a look at the quick start:
http://incubator.apache.org/whirr/quick-start-guide.html
which was generated from
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/whirr/trunk/src/site/confluence/quick-start-guide.confluence
notice this was standard wiki markup (confluence wiki markup, same as available from apache)

You can read more about mvn site plugin here:
http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-site.html
Notice that other formats are available, not just confluence markup, also note that you can use different markup formats if you like in the same site (although probably not a great idea, but in some cases might be handy, for example whirr uses the confluence wiki, so we can pretty much copy/paste source docs from wiki to our site (svn) if we like)


Re maven vs our current ant based build. It's probably a good idea for us to move the build to maven at some point. We could initially move just the doc generation, and then incrementally move functionality from build.xml to mvn over a longer time period.
