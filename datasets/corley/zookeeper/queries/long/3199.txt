We are using Zookeeper in our system along with Apache Kafka. However, Zookeeper is not producing any relevant logs (even with lower log levels specified in log4j.properties) in the log file that could help us in identifying what is currently going on in ZK or Kafka cluster. 

Please let us know how to retrieve proper logs from ZK cluster.

Version of ZK : 3.4.13
