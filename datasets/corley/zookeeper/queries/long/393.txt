Right now a bookkeeper scan can limit the amount of data scanned by specifying the number of entries to be scanned. But in many cases, if the entries are of different sizes, it is not easy to know how many to scan.

It is better to be able to specify both a count limit as well as a size limit , with the semantics that the scan should stop if either of those limits is reached.
