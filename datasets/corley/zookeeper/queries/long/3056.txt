An issue was reported when a user failed to upgrade from 3.4.10 to 3.5.4 with missing snapshot file.

The code complains about missing snapshot file is here which is introduced as part of ZOOKEEPER-2325.

With this check, ZK will not load the db without a snapshot file, even the transaction log files are present and valid. This could be a problem for restoring a ZK instance which does not have a snapshot file but have a sound state (e.g. it crashes before being able to take the first snap shot with a large snapCount parameter configured).
