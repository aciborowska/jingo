First of all I don't know if "Wish" is the best task type for it. I just want to ask you a question.

Why login field in ZooKeeperSaslClient is a static one?
https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/client/ZooKeeperSaslClient.java#L81

I'd like to have many zookeeper clients in one process. I want each of them to read different section from jaas config. I know that I can specify which one should be read by setting system property:
https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/client/ZooKeeperSaslClient.java#L114

Unfortunately login field is static and it is instantiated during creation of first ZooKeeperSaslClient instance.

Maybe there is some reason behind decision of making "login" static - if yes, could you please explain it?
