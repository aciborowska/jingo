Here is the sequence of steps that reproduces the problem.
On a 3 server ensemble,
1. Bring up two servers (say 1 and 2). Lets say 1 is leading.
2. Bring down 2
3. Bring up 2. 
4. 2 gets a notification from 1 that it is leading but 2 doesn't accept it as a leader since it cannot find one other node that thinks 1 is the leader.


So the ensemble gets stuck where 2 isn't following. If at this point, 3 comes up, then one of 2 & 3 will become a leader and 1 will keep thinking it is the leader.


I am working on a patch to fix this issue.
