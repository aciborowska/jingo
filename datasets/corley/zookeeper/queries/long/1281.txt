When leaderServes = false the leader responds to the stat/srvr  letter words with simply "this ZooKeeper instance is not currently serving requests".  While I agree that is an accurate statement it's not terribly useful for monitoring programs.  Additionally, if members of the ensemble are not currently in the quorum it becomes impossible to tell who is out of the quorum and who is the leader of the quorum.

I'm not sure if the leader should have a specially formatted response for stat/srvr or if it should simply display less information (no connections for example).
