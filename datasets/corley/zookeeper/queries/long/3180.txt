On read heavy use case with large response data size, the serialization of response takes time and added overhead to the GC.

Add response cache helps improving the throughput we can support, which also reduces the latency in general.

This Jira is going to implement a LRU cache for the response, which shows some performance gain on some of our production ensembles.
