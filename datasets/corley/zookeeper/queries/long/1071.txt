If one repeatedly invokes:


/usr/lib/zookeeper/bin/zkServer.sh start



after the initial start 2 bad things happen:

1. ZK reports that it got started where in reality it failed with the following:

2011-05-24 10:18:58,217 - INFO  [main:NIOServerCnxn$Factory@143] - binding to port 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181
2011-05-24 10:18:58,219 - FATAL [main:ZooKeeperServerMain@62] - Unexpected exception, exiting abnormally
java.net.BindException: Address already in use



2. It clobbers the zookeeper_server.pid file
