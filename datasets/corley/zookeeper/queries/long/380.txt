currently, bookkeeper api allows just a bytes interface which is 
ld.write(bytes).

We should have an interface like 

Stream s = ledger.createStream() (I am not very sure of the interface right now but will post a more concrete one after giving it a little more thought)

now this stream can be used to wirte checkpoints as 
s.write(bytes)
and then closed to s.close() to close the snapshot. 
This api could use the current api to implement snapshots as chunks of bytes (buffered by stream s) that can be written via ld.write(bytes).
