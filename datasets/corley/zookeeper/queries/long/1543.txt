When connecting to a server with a valid session id, but invalid password, Zookeeper disconnects with a SESSION_EXPIRED error. This is blatantly false, its actually the wrong password. Returning a SESSION_EXPIRED in this case is also not documented anywhere.

This makes debugging this issue an absolute nightmare, since the server has already lead you down the wrong track (trying to figure out why the session is expired, but it isn't).

There's already an AUTH_FAILURE error, why not return that?
