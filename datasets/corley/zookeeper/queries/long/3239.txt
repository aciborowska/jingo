This AuthenticationProvider checks to make sure that the ensemble name the client intends to connect to matches the name that the server thinks it belongs to. If the name does not match,
this provider will close the connection

This AuthenticationProvider does not "authenticate" the client. It prevents the client accidentally connecting to a wrong ensemble.

This feature has been implemented in the Facebook internal branch and I'm going to upstream it to the trunk.
