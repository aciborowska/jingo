We're using ZK 3.5.3-beta.

When using literal IPv6 addresses in the zoo.cfg.dynamic file, ZK fails to come up with the connection to the peer ZKs keeps getting reset.

zookeeper.log indicates a badly formed address is the cause.

<2018.03.01 15:14:30 163 -0500><E><sdn3></2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:4:3888><org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManager> org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManager$InitialMessage$InitialMessageException: Badly formed address: 2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:2:3888

Our zoo.cfg.dynamic uses literal IPv6 addresses which according to ZOOKEEPER-1460 is supported.

server.1=[2001:db8::2]:2888:3888
server.2=[2001:db8::3]:2888:3888
server.3=[2001:db8::4]:2888:3888

 

Digging into QuorumCnxManager.java, InitialMessage.parse attemps to seperate the host portion from the port portion using ":" as a delimeter, which is a problem for IPv6 IPs.  And there's this comment:


// FIXME: IPv6 is not supported. Using something like Guava's HostAndPort
// parser would be good.

So it looks like peers address:port is failing to be parsed if they are specified as literal IPv6 addresses.  To confirm a workaround, I replaced my zoo.cfg.dynamic with hostnames instead, and everything worked as expected.
