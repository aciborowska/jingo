Using static member classes saves time and space because an instances of a nonstatic member class has a reference to its enclosing instance.

Also did some style improvements:

	JLS recommends modifiers be in this order: public protected private abstract static final transient volatile synchronized native strictfp.
	Inserted some spaces.
