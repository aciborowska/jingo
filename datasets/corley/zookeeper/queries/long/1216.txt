I did set up a new work environment for a presentation of Eclipse+EGit+Gerrit+Jenkins and found more warnings that were ignored on my machine.
Warnings are now down to 5! So no excuses to introduce new ones!

Fixed warnings:

	removed unused imports
	removed unused variables / methods
	added missing generics
	added ignore warnings for calls to deprecated code in tests
