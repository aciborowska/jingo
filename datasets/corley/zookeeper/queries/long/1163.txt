zk_hashtable.c:do_insert_watcher_object() line number 193 calls add_to_list with clone flag set to 1.  This leaks memory, since the original watcher object was already allocated on the heap by activateWatcher() line 330.

I will upload a patch shortly.  The fix is to set clone flag to 0 in the call to add_to_list().
