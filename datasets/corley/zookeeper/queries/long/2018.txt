After studying the steps ZooKeeper takes to update the logs we found the following bug. The bug may manifest in file systems with writeback buffering. 

If you run the zookeeper client script (zkCli.sh) with the following commands:
VALUE=”8KB value”  # 8KB in size
create /dir1 $VALUE
create /dir1/dir2 $VALUE

the strace generated at the zookeeprer node is: 
mkdir(v)
create(v/log)
append(v/log)
trunk(v/log)
…
fdatasync(v/log)
write(v/log)    ……. 1
write(v/log)    ……. 2
write(v/log)    ……. 3
fdatasync(v/log)

The last four calls are related to the second create of dir2.

If the last write (#3) goes to disk before the second write (#2) and the system crashes before #2 reaches the disk, the zookeeper node will not boot.
