Currently, a user can execute class-level single test, but cannot execute method-level ones.

This patch adds a support for method-level single test so as to facilitate ease of debugging failing tests (like ZOOKEEPER-2080).

Class-level test (exists in current version)

$ ant -Dtestcase=ReconfigRecoveryTest test-core-java


Method-level test (proposal)

$ ant -Dtestcase=ReconfigRecoveryTest -Dtest.method=testCurrentObserverIsParticipantInNewConfig test-core-java
