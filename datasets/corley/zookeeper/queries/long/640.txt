Hi,

I started packaging Zookeeper for Debian[1][2]. Thereby I had a problem excluding contrib/rest from the build without patching the upstream tarball. Could you please add some properties to your build.xml that allow me to (de)select contribs? In the example below I can easily override the properties:

<project name="zookeepercontrib">

  <property name="contribfilesetincludes" value="*/build.xml" />
  <property name="contribfilesetexcludes" value="" />

  <fileset id="contribfileset" 
           dir="." 
           includes="${contribfilesetincludes}"
           excludes="${contribfilesetexcludes}"
           />

  <target name="compile">
    <subant target="jar">
     <fileset refid="contribfileset" />
    </subant>
  </target>

Could you please also add a line to project.classpath:

  <path id="project.classpath">
      <fileset dir="${additional.lib.dir}" includes="*.jar"/>

For Debian I may not compile based on the jar files in lib but must use the jars already in Debian.
