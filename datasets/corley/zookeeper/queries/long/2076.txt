When a leader is removed during a reconfiguration, ZOOKEEPER-107 uses a mechanism where the old leader nominates the new one. Although it reduces the time for a new leader to be elected, it still takes too long. This JIRA is for two things:
1. Improve the mechanism, e.g., avoid loading snapshots, etc. during the handoff.
2. Make it a first-class citizen & export it as a client API. We get questions about this once in a while - how do I cause a different leader to be elected ? Currently the response is either kill or reconfigure the current leader.

Any one interested to work on this ?
