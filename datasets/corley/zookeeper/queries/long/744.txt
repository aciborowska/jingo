Filing a feature request based on a zookeeper-user discussion.

Zookeeper should have a new four-letter word that returns key-value pairs appropriate for importing to a monitoring system (such as Ganglia which has a large installed base)

This command should initially export the following:

(a) Count of instances in the ensemble.
(b) Count of up-to-date instances in the ensemble.

But be designed such that in the future additional data can be added. For example, the output could define the statistic in a comment, then print a key "space character" value line:

"""

	Total number of instances in the ensemble
zk_ensemble_instances_total 5
	Number of instances currently participating in the quorum.
zk_ensemble_instances_active 4
"""

That's a great idea. Please enter a JIRA for this - a new 4 letter word 
and JMX support. It would also be a great starter project for someone 
interested in becoming more familiar with the server code.
