As adoption of systemd by distributions grows, it would be nice to have systemd configuration and startup files for Zookeeper in the upstream tree. I would thus like to contribute the following patch which brings the followings systemd files:


	sysusers.d_zookeeper.conf: creates zookeeper Linux system user to run Zookeeper
	tmpfiles.d_zookeeper.conf: creates temporary /var/log/zookeeper and {{/var/lib/zookeeper} directories
	zookeeper.service: regular systemd startup script
	zookeeper@.service: systemd startup script for specific use (for instance when Zookeeper is invoked to support some other piece of software â€“ example for Kafka, example for Storm)
