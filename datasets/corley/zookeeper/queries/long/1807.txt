Hey Alexander Shraer,

I noticed today that my Observers are spamming each other trying to open connections to the election port. I've got tons of these:


2013-11-01 22:19:45,819 - DEBUG [WorkerSender[myid=13]] - There is a connection already for server 9
2013-11-01 22:19:45,819 - DEBUG [WorkerSender[myid=13]] - There is a connection already for server 10
2013-11-01 22:19:45,819 - DEBUG [WorkerSender[myid=13]] - There is a connection already for server 6
2013-11-01 22:19:45,819 - DEBUG [WorkerSender[myid=13]] - There is a connection already for server 12
2013-11-01 22:19:45,819 - DEBUG [WorkerSender[myid=13]] - There is a connection already for server 14



and so and so on ad nauseam. 

Now, looking around I found this inside FastLeaderElection.java from when you committed ZOOKEEPER-107:


     private void sendNotifications() {
-        for (QuorumServer server : self.getVotingView().values()) {
-            long sid = server.id;
-
+        for (long sid : self.getAllKnownServerIds()) {
+            QuorumVerifier qv = self.getQuorumVerifier();



Is that really desired? I suspect that is what's causing Observers to try to connect to each other (as opposed as just connecting to participants). I'll give it a try now and let you know. (Also, we use observer ids that are > 0, and I saw some parts of the code that might not deal with that assumption - so it could be that too..).
