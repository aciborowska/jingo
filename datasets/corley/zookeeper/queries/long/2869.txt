As part of ZOOKEEPER-961, when the client re-establishes a connection to the server, it will sleep for a random number of milliseconds in the range [0, 1000). Introduced here.

These reconnects can cause excessive logging in clients if the server is unavailable for an extended period of time, with reconnects every 500ms on average.

One solution could be to allow for exponential backoff in the client. The backoff params could be made configurable.
