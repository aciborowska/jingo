Given three nodes, the leader on 2, but some issue with this machine, so I shutdown this machine, and change the host name to another machine.
Then I start the node in the new machine, but the new node can not join.
I found the the 1 and 3's Listener thread exit.

With the code of Listener's run method:
I think we should catch UnresolvedAddressException to avoid the Listener exit.

@Override
        public void run() {
           
            while((!shutdown) && (numRetries < 3)){
                try {
                   // bind and accept
                        receiveConnection(client);
                  
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    
                }
            }
            //
        }
