Hi guys:

I'am working on doing a big refactor for the documetations.it aims to 


	1.make a better reading experiences and help users know more about zookeeper quickly,as good as other projects' doc(e.g redis,hbase).




	2.have less changes to diff with the original docs as far as possible.




	3.solve the problem when we have some new features or improvements,but cannot find a good place to doc it.



 

The new catalog may looks kile this:


	is new one added.




	
	
		is the one to keep unchanged as far as possible.
	
	




	
	
		
		
			is the one modified.
