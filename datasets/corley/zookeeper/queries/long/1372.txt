I started a 2 server ensemble, made some changes to znodes, then shutdown the cluster. 

I then removed the datadir from the original leader. 

I then restarted the entire ensemble. 

after this the new leader has a zxid of 0x400000000 while the follower reported a zxid of 0x300000007 (the last zxid of the old epoch). This was via stat. 

I then connected a client to the ensemble, subsequent to which the zxid was again in sync. The data all seemed fine, but stat was reporting invalid information until a client connected.
