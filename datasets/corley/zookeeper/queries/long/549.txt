For the Observers patch (ZOOKEEPER-368), a lot of functionality is shared between Followers and Observers. To avoid copying code, it makes sense to push the common code into a parent Peer class and specialise it for Followers and Observers. At the same time, some of the lengthier methods in Follower can be broken up to make the code more readable.
