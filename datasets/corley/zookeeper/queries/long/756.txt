Copied from the already closed ZOOKEEPER-678:


	specify the exact URL, where the icons are from. It's best to include the link also in the NOTICE.txt file.




It seems, that zooinspector finds it's icons only if the icons folder is in the current path. But when I install zooinspector as part of the Zookeeper Debian package, I want to be able to call it regardless of the current path.
Could you use getRessources or something so that I can point to the icons location from the wrapper shell script?

Can I place the zooinspector config files in /etc/zookeeper/zooinspector/ ? Could I give zooinspector a property to point to the config file location?

There are several places, where viewers is missspelled as "Veiwers". Please do a case insensitive search for "veiw" to correct these. Even the config file "defaultNodeVeiwers.cfg" is missspelled like this. This has the potential to confuse the hell out of people when debugging something!
