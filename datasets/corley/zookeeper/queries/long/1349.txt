Start the .zkCli.sh in readonly mode. ZooKeeper client is supporting the readonly mode, it would be desirable the admin shell is providing the same support and can be able to see the status.

Suggestion:- 
Add one more parameter as follows specifying the r-o mode.

./zkCli.sh -server 10.18.52.144:2179:readonly
