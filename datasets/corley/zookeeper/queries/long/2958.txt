If run zookeeper client in tomcat:
1. create zookeeper connect to zookeeper server
2. connected zookeeper server
3. webapp stopped cause by other reason, so the WebappClassLoader in tomcat can't load new class.
4. run method in ClientCnxn.SendThread has a while loop catch all throwable, so the client will reconnect to the server, and then repeat these steps forever.

So, suggest give a StateChecker interface user can override it


public class ClientCnxn{
  public class SendThread extend Thread{
    public void run(){
       while(stateChecker.check()){
       }
     }
  }
}



So I can pass a StateChecker to check the tomcat WebappClassLoader state.

Thanks
