The interface org.apache.zookeeper.client.HostProvider exist but it is hardcoded to org.apache.zookeeper.client.StaticHostProvider at Zookeeper constructor.

Now it could be replaced by any other implementation just by calling the new Zookeeper constructor methods which accept a HostProvider as paramater.
