I would like to extend the existing REST Interface to also support:

	configuration
	ephemeral znodes
	watches - PubSubHubbub
	ACLs
	basic authentication



I want to do this because when building web applications that talks directly to ZooKeeper a REST API it's a lot easier to use (there is no protocol mismatch) than an API that uses persistent connections. I plan to use the improved version to build a web-based administrative interface.
