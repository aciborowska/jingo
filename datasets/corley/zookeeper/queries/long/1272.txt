The client API method Zookeeper.multi() promisses, that the KeeperException it throws in case of one of the multi ops failing, contains a list of individual results.

The method ZooKeeper.multiInternal() however throws a Keeperexception if the returned response header has an error code != 0. This should actually never happen if the server does not misbehave since the error code of a multi response is always zero, but I managed to trigger this code path with my refactorings.
