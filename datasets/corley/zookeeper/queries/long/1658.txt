We want to make client configuration easy so the quorum is just a single A rrset with multiple IP addresses. This isn't ideal because we need to hard-code the IPs off our zookeeper servers and they already have domain names. If zookeeper supported SRV, we could just do:

  _zookeeper.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 10 60 2181 worker1
  _zookeeper.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 10 20 2181 worker2
  _zookeeper.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 10 10 2181 worker3

and -Dhbase.zookeeper.quorum=example.com
