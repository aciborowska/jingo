If you look at Learner#syncWithLeader:


            while (self.isRunning()) {
                readPacket(qp);
                switch(qp.getType()) {
.......

                case Leader.INFORM:
                case Leader.INFORMANDACTIVATE:
                    PacketInFlight packet = new PacketInFlight();
                    packet.hdr = new TxnHeader();

                    if (qp.getType() == Leader.COMMITANDACTIVATE) {



I guess "qp.getType() == Leader.COMMITANDACTIVATE" is a typo that should read "qp.getType() == Leader.INFORMANDACTIVATE".

Assigning to Alexander for now since this is part of ZOOKEEPER-107.
