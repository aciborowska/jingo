I was doing some fault injection testing of 3.2.1 with ZOOKEEPER-508 patch applied and noticed that after some time the ensemble failed to re-elect a leader.

See the attached log files - 5 member ensemble. typically 5 is the leader

Notice that after 16:23:50,525 no quorum is formed, even after 20 minutes elapses w/no quorum

environment:

I was doing fault injection testing using aspectj. The faults are injected into socketchannel read/write, I throw exceptions randomly at a 1/200 ratio (rand.nextFloat() <= .005 => throw IOException

You can see when a fault is injected in the log via:
2009-08-19 16:57:09,568 - INFO  [Thread-74:ReadRequestFailsIntermittently@38] - READPACKET FORCED FAIL

vs a read/write that didn't force fail:
2009-08-19 16:57:09,568 - INFO  [Thread-74:ReadRequestFailsIntermittently@41] - READPACKET OK

otw standard code/config (straight fle quorum with 5 members)

also see the attached jstack trace. this is for one of the servers. Notice in particular that the number of sendworkers != the number of recv workers.
