We use Amazon Elastic IP for zookeeper hosts so that the zookeeper hosts have the same IP address after a restart.

The issue is, if one host is down then we cannot connect to the other hosts.

Here is an example connect string:

"ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com, ec2-4-3-2-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com, ec2-5-5-5-5.compute-1.amazonaws.com"

If all three hosts are up, we can connect. If one host is down, then we cannot create a Zookeeper instance due to an UnknownHost exception, even though the other servers in the connect string are valid.
