The client port in JMX is always zero. it should be getting the client port from the cnxnfactory. it's a pretty easy fix. the really problem is that we have a setter for the clientPort as well, which is a bit more complicated to implement correctly. do we need a setter for the clientPort? i think we should make it a readonly attribute.
