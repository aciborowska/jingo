At the moment a JAAS configuration file needs to be created with the Kerberos principal specified as user/host. It would be much easier for deployment automation if the host portion could be resolved at startup time, as supported in Hadoop (something like user/_HOST instead of user/hostname). A configuration alternative to global JAAS conf would be even better (via direct properties in zoo.cfg?).
