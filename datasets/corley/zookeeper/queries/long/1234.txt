	order class members: properties, constructor, methods
	make properties private final
	rename version to protocolVersion
	The integer value 0x10000 should be extracted to a constant with a declarative name. But since I don't yet fully understand its purpose, I've no idea for the name of the constant.
	Initialize properties BinaryInpuutArchive ia, BinaryOutputArchive oa and BuferedOutputSream bufferedOutput in the constructor so that they can be made final.
	Remove call to sock.setSoTimeout. All two users of the class set the sockettimeout anyways themselfes. This also removes a link to the Leader class.
	remove unused method packetToString.
