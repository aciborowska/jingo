Use search-hadoop.com service to make available search in ZK sources, MLs, wiki, etc.
This was initially proposed on user mailing list (http://search-hadoop.com/m/sTZ4Y1BVKWg1). The search service was already added in site's skin (common for all Hadoop related projects) before (as a part of AVRO-626) so this issue is about enabling it for ZK. The ultimate goal is to use it at all Hadoop's sub-projects' sites.
