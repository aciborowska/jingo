Use case is to store reference count (integer type) in znode.

It is desirable to provide support for atomic increment / decrement of the znode value.

Suggestion from Flavio:

you can read the znode, keep the version of the znode, update the value, write back conditionally. The condition for the setData operation to succeed is that the version is the same that it read
While the above is feasible, developer has to implement retry logic him/herself. It is not easy to combine increment / decrement with other operations using multi.
