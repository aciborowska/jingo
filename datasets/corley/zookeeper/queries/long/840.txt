Each operation calls validatePath, handles the chroot, calls ClientCnxn and 
checks the return header for error. I'd like to address this with the 
operation classes:
Each operation should receive a prechecked Path object. Calling ClientCnxn and 
error checking is not (or only partly) the concern of the operation but of an 
"executor" like class.
