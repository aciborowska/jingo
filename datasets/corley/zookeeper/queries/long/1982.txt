This JIRA extends the idea of ZOOKEEPER-1978.

Besides refactoring get-put operations of concurrentMap in addSession method, addSession also calls touchSession which repeatedly checks if session existed. So it would be nice for refactor. Refactoring the second issue is relevant to ZOOKEEPER-1978. So I create a this JIRA to fix both.
