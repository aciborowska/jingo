This will allocate an arbitrarily large byte buffer (and try to read it!):


    public boolean receiveConnection(Socket sock) {
        Long sid = null;
...
                sid = din.readLong();
                // next comes the #bytes in the remainder of the message                                                                             
                int num_remaining_bytes = din.readInt();
                byte[] b = new byte[num_remaining_bytes];
                // remove the remainder of the message from din                                                                                      
                int num_read = din.read(b);



This will crash the QuorumCnxManager thread, so the cluster will keep going but future elections might fail to converge (ditto for leaving/joining members). 

Patch coming up in a bit.
