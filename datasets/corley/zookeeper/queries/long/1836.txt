There is a relatively innocuous but useless pointer assignment in
addrvec_next():

195	void addrvec_next(addrvec_t *avec, struct sockaddr_storage *next)
....
203	    if (!addrvec_hasnext(avec))
204	    {
205	        next = NULL;
206	        return;

That assignment on (205) has no point, as next is a local variable lost upon function return.  Likely this should be a memset to zero out the actual parameter.
