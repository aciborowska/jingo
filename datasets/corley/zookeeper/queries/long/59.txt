There are two synchronized blocks locking on different objects, and to me they should be guarded by the same object. Here are the parts of the code I'm talking about:


NIOServerCnxn.readRequest@444
...
          synchronized (this) {
                outstandingRequests++;
                // check throttling
                if (zk.getInProcess() > factory.outstandingLimit) {
                    disableRecv();
                    // following lines should not be needed since we are already
                    // reading
                    // } else {
                    // enableRecv();
                }
            } 




NIOServerCnxn.sendResponse@740
...
         synchronized (this.factory) {
                outstandingRequests--;
                // check throttling
                if (zk.getInProcess() < factory.outstandingLimit
                        || outstandingRequests < 1) {
                    sk.selector().wakeup();
                    enableRecv();
                }
            }



I think the second one is correct, and the first synchronized block should be guarded by "this.factory". 

This could be related to issue ZOOKEEPER-57, but I have no concrete indication that this is the case so far.
