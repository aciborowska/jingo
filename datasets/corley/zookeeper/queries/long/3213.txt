	first i found my spark(2.2.0) turn to standby (HA mode with zk) and i can not restart the service to restore the problem。
	Then I found that there are three nodes in the /spark/leader_election/ directory, which are 48, 93, and 94. These are temporary sequential nodes, and 48 should have been timed out. And I looked at the transaction log and did have a log of delete 48. But the actual data still exists.



The above phenomenon appears on the two nodes 10.35.104.123 and 10.35.104.125, and only 93 and 94 on 10.35.104.124.
