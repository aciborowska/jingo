src/java/main ZooKeeper.java has a method "public void disconnect()" that is not part of the public api but put there for testing purposes (to test disconnection of the client from the server w/o actually shutting down the session)

This method needs to be moved out of the public api. preferably we should have a subclass in the test code itself that provides this method.
