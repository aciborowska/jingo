After the apparently valid fix to ZOOKEEPER-1294, testNoLogBeforeLeaderEstablishment is failing for me about one time in four. While I'll investigate whether the patch is 1294 is ultimately to blame, reading the test brought to light a number of issues that appear to be bugs or in need of improvement:


	As part of QuorumTest, an ensemble is already established by the fixture setup code, but apparently unused by the test which uses QuorumUtil.
	The test reads QuorumPeer.leader and QuorumPeer.follower without synchronization, which means that writes to those fields may not be published when we come to read them.
	The return value of sem.tryAcquire is never checked.
	The progress of the test is based on ad-hoc timings (25 * 500ms sleeps) and inscrutable numbers of iterations through the main loop (e.g. the semaphore blocking the final asserts is released only after the 20000th of 50000 callbacks)
	The test as a whole takes ~30s to run



The first three are easy to fix (as part of fixing the second, I intend to hide all members of QuorumPeer behind getters and setters), the fourth and fifth need a slightly deeper understanding of what the test is trying to achieve.
