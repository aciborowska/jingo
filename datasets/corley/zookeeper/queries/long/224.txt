I've created the maven poms needed for the 3.0.0 release.  

The directory structure and artifacts located at:
http://people.apache.org/~chirino/zk-repo/
aka
people.apache.org:/x1/users/chirino/public_html/zk-repo


Just need sto get GPG signed by the project KEY and deployed to:
people.apache.org:/www/people.apache.org/repo/m2-ibiblio-rsync-repository

Who's the current ZooKeeper release manager?
