We currently don't include configure scripts, just the .ac file itself. This means that users are required
to run "autoreconf; ./configure" rather than just configure.

We should commit the configure script(s) to svn (hadoop core does this btw) for our autotools based projects (currently c client api and zkfuse).

Also these should be included in the build.
