Hi
I run zookeeper in 3 Linux Machines. 

1.I downloaded zookeeper-3.4.10.jar file and extracted that.
2.I copy zoo_sample to zoo.cfg and edited datadir and added 3 ip address.
3.I created a new file called myid and insert numbers into that.
Now I am running zookeeper cluster successfully..but

When I am trying to run it as a service I am getting following error

zookeeper.service - Apache ZooKeeper
  Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/zookeeper.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
  Active: activating (auto-restart) (Result: exit-code) since Wed 2017-05-03 09:56:28 IST; 1s ago

May 03 09:56:28 deds14 systemd[1]: zookeeper.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.
