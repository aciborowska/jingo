Tests have been failing for us in an environment where we removed the CONSOLE appender from log4j. This breaks a couple of tests in QuorumPeerMainTest at least.

I have fixed in our builds by replacing CONSOLE with ROLLINGFILE (which we are using) for the time being, but messing with the log config shouldn't break tests.
