We have seen several cases where users have embedded zookeeper in
their application instead of running ZooKeeper in an independent JVM.

Different applications use different ways of starting and stopping QuorumPeer.
Instead, we should provide a standard and simple API for starting/stopping
zookeeper (and also document it).
