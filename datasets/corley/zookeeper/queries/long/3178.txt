For some reason, the ReadOnlyZooKeeperServer was implemented with PrepRequestProcessor, which is meaningless and error-prone, since all it does is preparing txn, and we shouldn't allow txns being created on non-leader server.
 
This will cause dangling global session on RO observer, because the createSession is being generated, and the code thought it's global session and added to Snapshot.
