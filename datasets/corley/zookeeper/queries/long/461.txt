We currently use several znodes to represent the configuration and state of a ledger in ZooKeeper. Although this is good for readability, it makes operations such as create, close, and open more complex, in particular the asynchronous versions of these operations. The main idea of this jira is to store as much as possible of the configuration of a ledger as data of a single znode.
