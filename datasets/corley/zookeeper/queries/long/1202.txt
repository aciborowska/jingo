ZooKeeper.close() doesn't force the client into a CLOSED state. While the closing flag ensures that the client will close, its state may end up in CLOSED, CONNECTING or CONNECTED.
I developed a patch and in the process cleaned up a few other things primarily to enable testing of state transitions.


	ClientCnxnState is new and enforces certain state transitions
	ZooKeeper.isExpired() is new
	ClientCnxn no longer refers to ZooKeeper, WatchManager is externalized, and ClientWatchManager includes 3 new methods
	The SendThread terminates the EventThread on a call to close() via the event-of-death
	Polymorphism is used to handle internal exceptions (SendIOExceptions)
	The patch incorporates ZOOKEEPER-126.patch and prevents close() from blocking
