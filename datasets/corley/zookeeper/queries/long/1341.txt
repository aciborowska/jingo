The handling of an invalid multi op in org.apache.zookeeper.server.DataTree.processTxn(TxnHeader, Record) is unusual, looks wrong to me.

In particular an IOException is thrown and then essentially ignored, it seems to me we should fail the operation properly instead. This will be more important if we add new op types going fwd.

Use of assert is a bit suspect as well, however perhaps it's fine... not sure. (we don't explicitly turn on assertions in our tests so not sure how useful it is regardless)

Also notice that the catch of IOException is ignoring the result. It seems to me that handling this exception should be localized to the multi block (separate it out to it's own method seems like a good idea).

We should add a test for this case.
