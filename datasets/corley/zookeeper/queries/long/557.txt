There are many cool release of hadoop zookeeper and this project is an apache project, as the maven project.
But the released jars must be download manually and then deploy to a private repository before they can be used by developer using maven2.

Please could you upload the zookeeper  jars on the public maven2 repository ?

Of course, we can help to deploy those artifact if necessary.
