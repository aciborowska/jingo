zkServer.sh is good at starting zookeeper and figuring out the right options to pass along.

unfortunately if you want to wrap zookeeper startup/shutdown in any significant way, you have to reimplement a bunch of the logic there.

the attached patch addresses a couple simple issues:
1. add a 'start-foreground' option to zkServer.sh - this allows things that expect to manage a foregrounded process (daemontools, launchd, etc) to use zkServer.sh instead of rolling their own to launch zookeeper

2. add a 'print-cmd' option to zkServer.sh - rather than launching zookeeper from the script, just give me the command you'd normally use to exec zookeeper.  I found this useful when writing automation to start/stop zookeeper as part of smoke testing zookeeper-based applications

3. Deal more gracefully with supplying alternate configuration files to zookeeper - currently the script assumes all config files reside in $ZOOCFGDIR - also useful for smoke testing

4. communicate extra info ("JMX enabled") about zookeeper on STDERR rather than STDOUT (necessary for #2)

5. fixes an issue on macos where readlink doesn't have the '-f' option.
