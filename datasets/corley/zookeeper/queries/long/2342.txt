ZOOKEEPER-1371 removed our source code dependency on Log4J.  It appears that this also removed the Log4J SLF4J binding jar from the runtime classpath.  Without any SLF4J binding jar available on the runtime classpath, it is impossible to write logs.

This JIRA investigated migration to Log4J 2 as a possible path towards resolving the bug introduced by ZOOKEEPER-1371.  At this point, we know this is not feasible short-term.  This JIRA remains open to track long-term migration to Log4J 2.
