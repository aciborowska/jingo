	make things private where possible
	does preAllocSize need to be static and therefor global?
	the append method has one big if statement from begin to end. make this a fast return
	new private method to initialize a new logStream if logSTream == null
	move the check for a faulty transaction in the method o.a.z.s.persistence.Util.marshallTxnEntry
	mashallTxnEntry is only ever used from the append method of FileTxnLog. However I've seen the same code somewhere else...
	new private method that returns a checksum for a given bytebuffer and length
