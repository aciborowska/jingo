Currently ZooKeeper requires 3 servers to provide both reliability and availability. This is fine for large internet scale clusters, but there are lots of two node clusters that could benefit from ZooKeeper.  There are also single server use cases where it is highly desirable to have ZooKeeper survive a disk failure, but availability is not as important. 

This feature would allow the configuration of multiple destinations for logs and snapshots. A transaction is committed when a majority of the log writes complete successfully. If one log gets an error on write, then it is taken offline until an administrator brings it online or replaces it with a new destination. ZooKeeper continues to run as long as a quorum of disks can be written.

High availability can be provided with a two node cluster. When the ZooKeeper node dies, the  disks are switched to the surviving node and a new ZooKeeper starts. Faster switch over can be done if there is an observer already running in the new node.
