the four letter word "reqs" doesn't do anything - it always returns empty data. Seems that "outstanding" field is always empty and never set.

we should remove outstanding and also update the reqs code to correctly output the outstanding requests (if not possible then remove the cmd and update docs - although this is very useful command, hate to see us lose it)
