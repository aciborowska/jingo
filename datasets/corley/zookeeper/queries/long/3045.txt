After stopping and starting the ZooKeeper stdout of the ZooKeeper is sporadically polluted with EndOfStreamException warnings. As it can be seen from the attached output the warnings are outputted in 0.2 millisecond intervals. This goes on until the ZooKeeper is stopped. If we are dumping the output to a file this fills up the storage immediately.
