This test relies on hooking into our logging system and creates a new appender using a PatternLayout object shared with the CONSOLE appender. PatternLayout has some synchronization issues (https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/PatternLayout.html) so we should create a new instance of it.
