In ZOOKEEPER-1573 we decided to fix an issue by relaxing some of the checking. Specifically when the sequence of txns is as follows:


	zxid 1: create /prefix/a
	zxid 2: create /prefix/a/b
	zxid 3: delete /prefix/a/b
	zxid 4: delete /prefix/a



the log may fail to replay.

We addressed this by relaxing a check, which is essentially invalid for this case, but is important in finding corruptions of the datastore.

We should add this check back with proper validation of correctness.
