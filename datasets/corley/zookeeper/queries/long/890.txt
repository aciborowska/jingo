Code using the C client assumes that watcher callbacks are called exactly once. If the watcher is called more than once, the process will likely overwrite freed memory and/or crash.

collect_session_watchers (zk_hashtable.c) gathers watchers from active_node_watchers, active_exist_watchers, and active_child_watchers without removing them. This results in watchers being invoked more than once.

Test code is attached that reproduces the bug, along with a proposed patch.
