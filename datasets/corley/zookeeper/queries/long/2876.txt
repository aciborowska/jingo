The github pull request test script (which is invoked as part of pre-commit workflow) should output -1 on a patch which does not include any tests, unless the patch is a documentation only patch.

We had this expected behavior before when we use the old PATCH approach:

    -1 tests included.  The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
                        Please justify why no new tests are needed for this patch.
                        Also please list what manual steps were performed to verify this patch.



A quick look on the script indicates that we do not set up the $PATCH/jira directory in the github test pull script, so it always thinks incoming pull request is a documentation only patch. This should be fixed so we get the old behavior and enforce that any new pull request must have tests unless explicitly justified not have to.
