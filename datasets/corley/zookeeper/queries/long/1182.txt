I did not find any way how one could tell the eclipse findbugs extension to ignore the java files under src/java/test. I already use src/java/test/config/findbugsExcludeFile.xml but there are still many findbug warnings.

So this patch solves the most obvious findbugs warnings under src/java/test. There are 30 remaining warnings which could either be ignored in the exclude file or solved by somebody with more knowledge about the code.
