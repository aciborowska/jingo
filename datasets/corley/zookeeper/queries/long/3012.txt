The following arrange methods uses hard coded values:

when(configMock.getDataDir()).thenReturn("/tmp/zookeeper");
when(configMock.getDataLogDir()).thenReturn("/tmp/zookeeperLog");


Which makes the test fail if the folders exist on the running machine.

Random test folders should be created and removed during cleanup.
