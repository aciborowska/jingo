Starting Zookeeper in the following way causes "ClassNotFoundException" errors, and aborts, in a log4j 2.x environment:


"%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java" %JAVAOPTIONS% org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerMain zookeeper.cfg



The log4j 2.x jars in the classpath are:


log4j-1.2-api
log4j-core
log4j-api



It appears that the Zookeeper QuorumPeerMain class is incompatible with the limited log4j 1.2 API that log4j 2.x includes.  Zookeeper 3.4.8 works fine with log4j 2.x except when you start it as a service in this way.
