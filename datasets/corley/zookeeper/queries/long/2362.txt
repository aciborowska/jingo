In this thread http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/zookeeper-user/201602.mbox/%3CCAPbqGzicBkLLyVDm7RFM20z0y3X1v1P-C9-1%3D%3D1DDqRDTzdOmQ%40mail.gmail.com%3E , I discussed an issue I've now seen in multiple environments:

In a multi (using Curator), I write 2 new nodes. At some point, I issue 2 reads for these new nodes. In one read, I see one of the new nodes. In a subsequent read, I fail to see the other new node:

1. Starting state : 
{ /foo = <does not exist>, /bar = <does not exist> }
2. In a multi, write: 
{ /foo = A, /bar = B}
3. Read /foo as A
4. Read /bar as <does not exist> 

#3 and #4 are issued 100% sequentially.

It is not known at what point during #2, #3 starts.

Note: the reads are getChildren() calls.
