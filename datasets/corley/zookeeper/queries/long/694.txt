It would be nice to have a mock/fake version of org.apache.zookeeper.Zookeeper that could be used for unit testing.  i.e., a single instance Zookeeper that operates completely in memory, with no network or disk I/O.

This would make it possible to pass one of the memory-only fake Zookeeper's into unit tests, while using a real Zookeeper in production code.


i.e., maybe something like this:

public interface ZooKeeperService {
...
}

public class ZooKeeperTester implements ZooKeeperService {
...
(stand-alone, in-memory, test implementation)
...
}

public class ZooKeeper implements ZooKeeperService {
...
("real" implementation)
...
}
