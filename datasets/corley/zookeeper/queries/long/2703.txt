It would be useful to have objective tests/benchmarks. These tests/benchmarks can be used to validate future changes to ZooKeeper, compare against other similar products (etcd/consul, etc.) or to help promote ZooKeeper. Possible candidates include:


	leader election tests/benchmarks
	service discovery tests/benchmarks
	distributed locks tests/benchmarks
	...



Note: each test/benchmark should be a sub-task under this master task
