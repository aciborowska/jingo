I have rediscovered an issue, that was apparently posted a while back (link below).  It seems that if I configure an Observer node to be enabled for read-only mode, with syncEnabled = true, it properly syncs its transaction log with the quorum.  However, if I shut down the quorum participants, and the Observer automatically transitions to read-only mode, it does not load the saved transaction log, and thus rejects any client connection with a zxid > 0.  But If I restart the Observer node, it reloads it's persisted transaction log and serves read-only requests at the latest zxid.  Is this the correct behavior? Things run fine if instead of an observer, I do the same with a read-only participant.  In this case, it transitions without issue to a read-only server, and serves the current transaction log.

It seems to me this issue renders read-only observers completely useless.  What am I missing here?

I'm seeing this with 3.4.8

It seems this was discovered and reported a long time ago here:
