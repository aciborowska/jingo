To avoid cargo culting and reducing duplicated code we can merge most of CreateRequest & CreateRequest2 given that only the Response object is actually different.

This will improve readability of the code plus make it less confusing for people adding new opcodes in the future (i.e.: copying a request definition vs reusing what's already there, etc.).
