Nodes fail to connect when a sub-domain is present in the FQDN.

The sub-domain is dropped from the hostname string when calling gethostname in zookeeper.c.

machine.sub.domain.com
becomes
machine.domain.com

#ifdef HAVE_GETHOSTNAME
  gethostname(buf, sizeof(buf));
  LOG_INFO(LOGCALLBACK(zh), "Client environment:host.name=%s", buf);
