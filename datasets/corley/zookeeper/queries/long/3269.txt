For testing and other reasons it would be very useful to add a way to inject an event into ZooKeeper's event queue. ZooKeeper already has the Testable for features such as this (low level, backdoor, testing, etc.). This queueEvent method would be particularly helpful to Apache Curator and we'd very much appreciate its inclusion.

The method should have the signature:



void queueEvent(WatchedEvent event);



Calling this would have the affect of queueing an event into the clients queue.
