A leader gives up leadership when losing a quorum of the current configuration.
This doesn't take into account any proposed configuration. So, if
a reconfig operation is in progress and a quorum of the new configuration is not
responsive, the leader will just get stuck waiting for it to ACK the reconfig operation, and will never timeout.
