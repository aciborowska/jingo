Here's what I get:

My guess is that testLastAcceptedEpoch doesn't properly close the connection before testLeaderInElectingFollowers starts.
I propose to add 

if (leadThread != null) {
                leadThread.interrupt();
                leadThread.join();
}       

to the test.


In addition, I propose to change the hard-wired ports in Zab1_0Test to use Portassignment.unique() as done in other tests. If I understand correctly the static counter used in unique() to assign ports is initialized once per test file, so it would also prevent the problem I'm seeing here of two tests in the same file trying to use the same port. 

The error can be reproduced using the attached patch (for some reason I don't see the problem in the trunk).
