The eclipse build target downloads a component from sourceforge.  It does this download with http, but sourceforge now requires https downloads.  The sourceforge page redirects to https, but ant is refusing to follow the redirect because it changes protocol.

The download in build.xml just needs to be changed to https and it will work.
