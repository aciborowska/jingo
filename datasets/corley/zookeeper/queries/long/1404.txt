The pseudo code for leader election in the recipes.html page of 3.4.3 documentation is the following...


Let ELECTION be a path of choice of the application. To volunteer to be a leader: 

1.Create znode z with path "ELECTION/guid-n_" with both SEQUENCE and EPHEMERAL flags;

2.Let C be the children of "ELECTION", and i be the sequence number of z;

3.Watch for changes on "ELECTION/guid-n_j", where j is the smallest sequence number such that j < i and n_j is a znode in C;

Upon receiving a notification of znode deletion: 

1.Let C be the new set of children of ELECTION; 

2.If z is the smallest node in C, then execute leader procedure;

3.Otherwise, watch for changes on "ELECTION/guid-n_j", where j is the smallest sequence number such that j < i and n_j is a znode in C; 


I think, in both third steps highest should appear instead of smallest.
