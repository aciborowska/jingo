create a java client 
create a persistent node using that client
write data into the node  
like..
ZkClient zk = new ZkClient ( getZKServers () );
        zk.createPersistent ( "/amith" , true );
        zk.writeData ( "/amith", "amith" );
        Object readData = zk.readData ( "/amith" );
        LOGGER.logInfo (readData);

        zk.delete ( "/amith" );

and try to read the same using ZkCli.sh console client

[zk: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:XXXXX(CONNECTED) 2] get /amith
ï¿½ï¿½tamith
cZxid = 0x100000004
ctime = Wed Oct 12 10:13:15 CST 2011
mZxid = 0x100000005
mtime = Wed Oct 12 10:13:15 CST 2011
pZxid = 0x100000004
cversion = 0
dataVersion = 1
aclVersion = 0
ephemeralOwner = 0x0
dataLength = 12
numChildren = 0
