After applying ZOOKEEPER-1049 to 3.3.3 (I believe the same problem exists in 3.4/3.5 but haven't tested this) I'm seeing the following exception more frequently:


Oct 19, 1:31:53 PM ERROR
Unexpected Exception:
java.nio.channels.CancelledKeyException
at sun.nio.ch.SelectionKeyImpl.ensureValid(SelectionKeyImpl.java:55)
at sun.nio.ch.SelectionKeyImpl.interestOps(SelectionKeyImpl.java:59)

at org.apache.zookeeper.server.FinalRequestProcessor.processRequest(FinalRequestProcessor.java:367)
at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.CommitProcessor.run(CommitProcessor.java:73)



This is a long standing problem where we try to send a response after the socket has been closed. Prior to ZOOKEEPER-1049 this issues happened much less frequently (2 sec linger), but I believe it was possible. The timing window is just wider now.
