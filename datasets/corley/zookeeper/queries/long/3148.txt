Branch 3.4 uses Apache Directory Service for Kerberos tests, this is not compatibile with JDK 11.

A simple "upgrade" is not enough.

The fix is to port Kerby based tests from branch-3.5 to branch-3.4 and make old tests run only on JDK6 and new tests with Kerby run on JDK7 onwards.

 

There will be some duplicated code, but branch-3.4 is expected to be sent in be deprecated soon, as 3.5 will be released as "stabile".

Those "old" test would be dropped in case we decide to drop JDK6 support.

 

Additionally JDK6 VMs cannot download dependencies from Maven Central due to SSL policies:

[ivy:retrieve]     Server access error at url https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/minidev/json-smart/ (javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received fatal alert: protocol_version)
