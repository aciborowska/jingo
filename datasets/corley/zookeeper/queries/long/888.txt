the c-client / zkpython wrapper invokes already freed watcher callback

steps to reproduce:
  0. start a zookeper server on your machine
  1. run the attached python script
  2. suspend the zookeeper server process (e.g. using `pkill -STOP -f org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerMain` )
  3. wait until the connection and the node observer fired with a session event
  4. resume the zookeeper server process  (e.g. using `pkill -CONT -f org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerMain` )

-> the client tries to dispatch the node observer function again, but it was already freed -> double free corruption
