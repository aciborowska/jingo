I found it very misleading that the javadoc for the exists() calls that take a boolean or a Watcher state that 'The watch will be triggered by a successful operation that creates/delete the node or sets the data on the node.'

What I've seen from descriptions of bugs (older but this is this references it http://zookeeper-user.578899.n2.nabble.com/Exists-Watch-Triggered-by-Delete-td1490893.html) and my own personal usage is that watchers set on exists() are triggered when a non-existing node is now created or an existing node is changed.  They are NOT triggered when the node already exists and is deleted.
