Report from user Murali Vemulapati. The wiki recipe page also should be updated to handle multiple clients using the barrier on the same system (multiple processes, etc...). Currently the docs/example support only a single user of the barrier per host.

------------------

I believe there is a typo in the barrier example given at:

http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/current/zookeeperTutorial.html

With the following fix, the program runs as expected:
==============
83c83
<                 this.name = new String(InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName().toString());
—
>                 name = new String(InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName().toString());
100c100
<                     CreateMode.EPHEMERAL_SEQUENTIAL);
—
>                     CreateMode.EPHEMERAL);
==============
The first change assigns the name to the instance variable 'name' of Barrier class (otherwise the 'name' instance variable will have a value of 'null'
when calling zk.create to create the child node under the root barrier node).
The second change lets us run multiple processes on the same machine.
