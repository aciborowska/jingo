There have been several jira tickets to fix the close logic but there are still possibilities for blocks as discovered in ZOOKEEPER-911.

For example the failing server.InvalidSnapshotTest times out because the ClientCnxn.close() call blocks in Packet.waitForFinish().

However the only change introduced is that instead of

synchronize(packet) while(!packet.finished) packet.wait()

I call packet.waitForFinish() which is a synchronized method.

The bug is in ClientCnxn.queuePacket:
ClientCnxn.closing is set to true before the closeSession Packet is added to outgoingQueue. Between these two steps, the SendThread already terminate so that there's nobody left to call packet.notifyAll().
