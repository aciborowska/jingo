The following block in Leader.getEpochToPropose:


if (lastAcceptedEpoch > epoch) {
	epoch = lastAcceptedEpoch+1;
}



needs to be fixed, since it doesn't increment the epoch variable in the case epoch != -1 (initial value) and lastAcceptedEpoch is equal. The fix trivial and corresponds to changing > with >=.
