If we write simultaneously to a large number of ledgers on a bookie, then performance drops significantly due to more seeks on the ledger device. In such cases, we should be clustering ledgers into files to reduce the number of seeks, and performing sequential writes on each file. Clustering ledgers will impact read performance, so we would to have a knob to control such a feature.
