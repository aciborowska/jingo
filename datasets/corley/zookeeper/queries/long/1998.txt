(commented this on ZOOKEEPER-338)

I've just noticed that we call getaddrinfo from zookeeper_interest... on every call. So from zookeeper_interest we always call update_addrs:

https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/c/src/zookeeper.c#L2082

which in turns unconditionally calls resolve_hosts:

https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/c/src/zookeeper.c#L787

which does the unconditional calls to getaddrinfo:

https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/c/src/zookeeper.c#L648

We should fix this since it'll make 3.5.0 slower for people relying on DNS. I think this is happened as part of ZOOKEEPER-107 in which the list of servers can be updated.
