Create a basic checkstyle file, in order to cover the minimal check on @author tags.

This is needed in order to drop old ANT based precommit job (see ZOOKEEPER-3351)

We will not remove legacy checkstyle configuration file in zookeeper-server/src/test/resources/checkstyle.xml because it is referred by ANT build.xml files (even if we are not actually using that target).

This task won't add a complete checkstyle configuration with usual checks because it would imply almost a change at every .java in the codebase.
