Zookeeper allows creation of an abritrary number of children, yet if the String array of children names exceeds 4,194,304 bytes a getChildren will fail because ClientCnxn$SendThread.readLength() throws an exception on line 490.  Mahadev Konar questioned this byte limit's need.  In any case consistency of create children, get children should exist.
