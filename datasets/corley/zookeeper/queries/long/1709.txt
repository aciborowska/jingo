The server only create a new log file after ~100k txn. The size of txnlog file can be quite large (> 1GB) if request size is big.

This will cause the server not to use txnlog to sync with the learner.  

So we added a parameter so that the server will create a new txnlog file whenever the size exceeded the limit.
