I have observed several connection timeouts with one single client, during periods of inactivity. From reports of other users, it seems that others are observing a similar issue. 

In my case, tickTime is 2000, and the client sets session timeout to be 10000. Client and servers are on different sites. I suspect there is something wrong with the mechanism that issues ping messages.
