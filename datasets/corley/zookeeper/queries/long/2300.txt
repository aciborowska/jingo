ZooKeeper currently exposes ClientPort and ClientAddress JMX properties. 
Same way we should expose SecureClientPort and SecureClientAddress.
The values for these two properties will be decided based on the configured value of secureClientPort and secureClientPortAddress

The value of SecureClientPort will be:
secureClientPort   (if secureClientPort is configured)
empty string  (If secureClientPort is not configured)

The value of SecureClientAddress will be:
secureClientPortAddress:secureClientPort    (if both secureClientPort and secureClientPortAddress are configured)
0.0.0.0:secureClientPort or 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:secureClientPort  (if only secureClientPort is configured)
empty string  (If secureClientPort is not configured)
