Currently Bookkeeper provides functionality for cold backups. If the entity logging to bookkeeper fails, its replacement must recover the ledgers which had been used for backup before becoming available. This is acceptable in some cases, such as HBase Wals where a small delay in recovery only results in a small percentage of data being unavailable. 

However, systems such as the HDFS namenode, this delay can be unacceptable, such as cases where data is being served to customers. Secondary namenodes should be ready to go the instant the primary goes down.

TeaKeeper proposes a wrapper library around Bookkeeper providing T-Junction like functionality for logging. It also provides for primary/secondary election and automated hot failover. 

HDFS namenode is primary target of this work.
