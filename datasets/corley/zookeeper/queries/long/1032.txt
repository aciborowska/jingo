when the number of nodes is large, it may take a long time to recover from leader failure
there are some points to improve:

1. Follower should take snapshot asynchronously when follower up to date

2. Currently Leader/Follower will clear the DataTree on leader failures, and then restore it from a snapshot and transaction logs. DataTree should not be cleared, only restore it from transaction logs.

3. FileTxnLog should store recently transaction logs in memory, so when DataTree is not behind the transaction logs a lot, the transaction logs in memory can be used to restore DataTree.
