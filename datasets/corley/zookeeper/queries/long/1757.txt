I was investigating data inconsistency bug in our internal branch. One possible area is snapshot/txnlog corruption. So I wrote a more robust corruption test and found that it is easy to break our checksum algorithm which is Adler32.

When this happen, it is more likely that corrupted data will fail other sanity check during deserialization phase, but it is still scary that it can pass the checksum.
