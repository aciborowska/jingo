If a client tries to execute some illegal operations inside a transaction, ZooKeeper throws an exception.

Some exceptions such as NodeExistsException should have a path to indicate where the exception occurred.
ZooKeeper clients can get the path by calling method getPath.
However, this method returns null if the exception occurs inside a transaction.
For example, when a client calls create /a and create /a in a transaction,
ZooKeeper throws NodeExistsException but getPath returns null.
In normal operation (outside transactions), the path information is set correctly.
The patch only shows this bug occurs with NoNode exception and NodeExists exception,
but this bug seems to occur with any exception which needs a path information:
When an error occurred in a transaction, ZooKeeper creates an ErrorResult instance to represent error result.

However, the ErrorResult class doesn't have a field for a path where an error occurred(See src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/OpResult.java for more details).
