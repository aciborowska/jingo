Currently ZooKeeper only allows using the server id which is an integer for identifying servers. For my (unavoidable) use case, there may be concurrent dynamic removes and adds of servers which may eventually have id collisions. When this occurs, there is no good way to determine if the server (given an id collision) that we want to remove is the right server.

To support my use case, I propose that we add a tag field to the server string.
For my specific use case, this tag field will be used to store a uuid as a string.
So for example:
server.1=127.0.0.1:1234:1236:participant;0.0.0.0:1237;743b9d23-85cb-45b1-8949-930fdabb21f0
