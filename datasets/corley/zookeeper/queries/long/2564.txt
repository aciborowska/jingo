No message is prompted when trying to delete quota with different quota option.

Steps to reproduce:-
1. Start zookeeper in cluster mode 
2. Create some node and set quota like
setquota -n 10 /test
3. Now try to delete as below:-
delquota -b /test

Here no message/exception is prompted. We should prompt message like 
"Byte Quota does not exist for /test"
