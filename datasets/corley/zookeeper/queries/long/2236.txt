I am facing a rename issue with Zkfuse. 
I am trying to test file atomic updates. After some iterations the file size becomes 0.
This is easily reproducible, just running the below script for ~5mins.

Setup:
zookeeper-3.4.6 with Zkfuse mounted, size of testFile = 1k

while [ 1 ]
do
        cp /root/testFile /mnt/zk/testFile.tmp
        mv /mnt/zk/testFile.tmp /mnt/zk/testFile
        ls -larth /mnt/zk/
        sleep 1
done

Zkfuse debug logs doesn't show any suspicious activity. Looks like zookeeper/zkfuse RENAME is not atomic.

But code browsing and log messages show that update have issues:
1) update is not able to pull data from zookeeper due to the _refCnt > 1,
so rename get an empty ZkfuseFile object.
2) I also hit an assert in update, 
assert(newFile == false || _isOnlyRegOpen());

Now I have suspicion on the refcount logic. Have any one faced similar issues or have used Zkfuse in production environment.
