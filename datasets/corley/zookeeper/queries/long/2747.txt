Currently when compiling ZooKeeper we se a compilation warning:

    [javac] /zookeeper/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/admin/ZooKeeperAdmin.java:43: warning: [try] auto-closeable resource ZooKeeperAdmin has a member method close() that could throw InterruptedException
    [javac] public class ZooKeeperAdmin extends ZooKeeper {
    [javac]        ^
    [javac] 2 warnings



This is due to the implementation of AutoCloseable in the ZooKeeper superclass. That class has a warning suppression and explanation, we should copy it to the ZooKeeperAdmin class.
