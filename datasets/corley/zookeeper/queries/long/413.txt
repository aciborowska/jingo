1) createClient in testclient.cc (check all tests) is not correctly waiting for syncconnected to the server
2) there are some instances of while(xxx); in the test code, this could cause problems, really we need to
have some limit on the number of iterations (other than just the test, which may never return false), also the
loop should have some sort of sleep(100msec) (whatever time) in order to limit cpu use.
