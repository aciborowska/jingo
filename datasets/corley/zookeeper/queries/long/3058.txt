In compareBytes method of org.apache.jute.Utils class, all the individual bytes of 2 byte arrays are compared and then their lengths are compared. We can improve the performance by first having length check, since we can rule out that they aren't equal by a single if condition(O(1) operation) rather than looping through arrays(O( n )Â operation).
