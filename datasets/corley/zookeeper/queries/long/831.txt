Reads and writes in BookKeeper are asymmetric: a write request writes one entry, whereas a read request may read multiple requests. The current implementation of throttling only counts the number of read requests instead of counting the number of entries being read. Consequently, a few read requests reading a large number of entries each will spawn a large number of read-entry requests.
