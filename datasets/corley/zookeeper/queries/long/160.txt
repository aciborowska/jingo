I'm adding new sections to the ZooKeeper Admin guide, but I don't have the content to fill them out. These sections are: 

	Designing a ZooKeeper Deployment
	Provisioning
	Things to Consider: ZooKeeper Strengths and Limitations
	Administering
	Monitoring
	Logging
	Troubleshooting



I'll add a subtask for each section.  

Note: If the area experts prefer, I can conduct a phone interview or email conversation or IM with them on the topic, and then write up the section so they don't have to.
