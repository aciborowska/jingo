A review of the ZK code shows that the NOTWATCHING event is never raised. However, most client users wouldn't know this and would (hopefully) write code to handle the event. We ran into this in our own code, as I refactored some event handling only to find this event isn't going to occur.

The responses from the community in the following discussion seem to confirm that this event should be removed: http://grokbase.com/t/zookeeper/user/1123dc333d/not-watching-event

I'm prepared to submit a patch (tested in our load-test environment) if this issue is accepted. I've removed the event completely from all client code (C, Python, etc). One possibility is to leave the event definition in-place, but add a "deprecated" comment so-as not to break existing code.
