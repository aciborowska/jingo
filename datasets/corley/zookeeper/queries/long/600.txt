I suppose the TODO below is referring to the "path" variable which is passed in as an output variable to PyArg_ParseTuple right below.  The TODO may be removed, since the code is right.  Code using PyArg_ParseTuple will borrow the reference from the calling code, since there's a stack behind the call to the enclosing function (pyzoo_get_children in this case) which won't go away until the function returns.
