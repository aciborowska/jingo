I lunch a client, then watch some node, call zoo_awget() to watch data, when the client exit, if the node data doesn't change, the callback 'watcher' won't be  invoked. and the memory of watcherCtx is not freed

ZOOAPI int zoo_awget(zhandle_t *zh, const char *path, 
        watcher_fn watcher, void* watcherCtx, 
        data_completion_t completion, const void *data);

I use valgrind to check and the result show the memory lost.
