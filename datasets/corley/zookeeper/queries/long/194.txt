According to the trunk version of zookeeperAdmin.xml, a quorum is a group of servers running an instance of the zookeeper service.This terminology is not standard. We should use "ensemble" to denote a group of zookeeper servers, and "quorum" to denote a minimum subset of the ensemble necessary, for example, to commit an operation or to support a leader. In our case, a quorum is always a majority of servers of the ensemble.
