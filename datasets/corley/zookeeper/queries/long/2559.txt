Failed to delete the set quota for ephemeral node when the node is deleted because of client session closed

[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 0] create -e /e_test hello
Created /e_test
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 1] setquota -n 10 /e_test
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 2] listquota /e_test
absolute path is /zookeeper/quota/e_test/zookeeper_limits
Output quota for /e_test count=10,bytes=-1
Output stat for /e_test count=1,bytes=5

Now close the client connection and so the ephemeral node gets deleted. But the corresponding quota is not getting deleted as below:-

[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 0] ls /
[test, test1, test3, zookeeper]
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 1] listquota /e_test
absolute path is /zookeeper/quota/e_test/zookeeper_limits
Output quota for /e_test count=10,bytes=-1
Output stat for /e_test count=0,bytes=0
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 2] 


and so now again create the ephemeral node with same node and try to set the quota, it will fail.

[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 2] create -e /e_test hello
Created /e_test
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 3] setquota -n 10 /e_test
Command failed: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: /e_test has a parent /zookeeper/quota/e_test which has a quota
