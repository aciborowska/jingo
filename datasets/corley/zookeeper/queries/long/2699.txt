Currently 4lw commands are executed without authentication and can be accessed from any IP which has access to ZooKeeper server. ZOOKEEPER-2693 attempts to limit the 4lw commands which are enabled by default or enabled by configuration.

In addition to ZOOKEEPER-2693 we should also restrict 4lw commands based on client IP as well. It is required for following scenario

	User wants to enable all the 4lw commands
	User wants to limit the access of the commands which are considered to be safe by default.



Implementation:
we can introduce new property 4lw.commands.host.whitelist

	By default we allow all the hosts, but off course only on the 4lw exposed commands as per the ZOOKEEPER-2693
	It can be configured to allow individual IPs(192.168.1.2,192.168.1.3 etc.)
	It can also be configured to allow group of IPs like 192.168.1.*
