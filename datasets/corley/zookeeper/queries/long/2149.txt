When a socket connection is established, in ZooKeeperServer, it would print logs:

"Established session 0x$(session) with negotiated timeout $(timeout) for client: $(client_hostport)"

However, in client, it would only print the server address:
"Socket connection established to $(server_hostport), initiating session"

It would be nice to log client local address when socket connection established. Because clients will reconnect and ports is randomly assigned. We can better associate these addresses in this way.
