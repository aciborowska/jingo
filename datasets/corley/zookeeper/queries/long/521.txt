The toplevel notice file should be updated to credit the gnu autotools project, something like:

This project includes scripts generated by GNU autotools (autoconf/automake/etc...).
These files are released under the Apache license.
This is permissible under the license clarification at:
    http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/autoconf-2.53/html_node/Distributing.html#Distributing


we should also take the opportunity to adjust the existing text as detailed here:
