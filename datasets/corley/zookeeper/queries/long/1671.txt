The zookeeper dependency 3.4.5 (latest) depends explicitly on log4j 1.2.15, which has dependencies on com.sun.jmx which can't be resolved from Maven central.

Please change the dependency to either 1.2.16, which declares these as optional, or 1.2.14, which doesn't have them at all.

<dependency>
<groupId>log4j</groupId>
<artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
<version>1.2.15</version>
<scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>

This should be modified to 1.2.14 or 1.2.16 as above.

It's also not clear why this is used at all; it would be better for ZooKeeper to depend only on slf4j-api, and let users determine what the right slf4j logging implementation is. With this approach, it's not possible to swap out log4j for something else.
