There's this in org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeper.multi(Iterable<Op>)


     * Executes multiple Zookeeper operations or none of them.  On success, a list of results is returned.
     * On failure, only a single exception is returned.  If you want more details, it may be preferable to
     * use the alternative form of this method that lets you pass a list into which individual results are
     * placed so that you can zero in on exactly which operation failed and why.



What is the "alternate form of this method" that's being referred to? Seems like we should add this functionality, or at the very least update the javadoc. (I don't think this is referring to Transaction, although the docs there are pretty thin)
