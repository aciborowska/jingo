Without the proposed patch, I get invalid manifests because stderr is added to the revision property. I think this might be something specific to my setup though:


    $ java -version
    Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -Dfile.encoding=utf8
    java version "1.7.0_51"
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment (fedora-2.4.5.1.fc20-x86_64 u51-b31)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.51-b03, mixed mode)



since it doesn't seem happen with older java/ant combinations.

Nonetheless, it seems like the right thing is to explicitly ignore stderr.
