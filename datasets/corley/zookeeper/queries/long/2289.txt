The current codebase supports use of SASL for authenticating connections, but it does not allow specifying the desired SASL Quality of Protection (QOP).  It always uses the default QOP, which is "auth" (authentication only).  This issue proposes to support the full set of available QOP settings by adding support for "auth-int" (authentication and integrity) and "auth-conf" (authentication and integrity and privacy/encryption).
