We have a service A, which has 2 instances A1 and A2. 
We also have another 2 services, B and C. B has 2 instances B1 and B2. C has 2 instances C1 and C2.

A1 and A2 both register child watch for B and C. 2 individual watches, of course.

I restart B1 and C1 nearly at the same time. Then, theoretically A1 and A2 
both should receive 2 events about the child change of service B and C.
However, the real result is, A1 received the 2 children changes of service B and C separately, A2 only received the children change of service B. Moreover, A2 got the children change of service B many many times when service B only changed once at that time (I add auto re-registration so A2 can receive the event more than once).

Till now, it only happened once. If it happens again, maybe I will provide some logs.
