These are initial patches to update Zookeeper to Netty 4.x API. They are not complete, as I am not familiar with Zookeeper or Netty. I just used Netty documents that detailed the difference in the API to make the changes. I believe I am 80-90% of the way there, but need someone familiar with Zookeeper and/or Netty to finish the last part and make sure it actually works and I did not fubar Zookeeper
