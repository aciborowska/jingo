In case of an authFailed sasl event we shutdown the send thread however we never close the event thread. Even if the client tries to close the connection it results in a no-op since we check forÂ cnxn.getState().isAlive() which results in negative for auth failed state and we return without cleaning up. For applications that retry in case of auth failed by closing the existing connection and then trying to reconnect(eg. hbase replication) this eventually ends up exhausting the system resources.
