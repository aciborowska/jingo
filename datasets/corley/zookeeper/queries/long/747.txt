The following patch adds a new language, C#, to the Jute code generation.  The code that is generated does have a dependency on a third party library, Jon Skeet's MiscUtil, which is Apache licensed.  The library is necessary because C# does not provide big endian support in the base class libraries.

As none of the existing Jute code has any unit tests, I have not added tests for this patch.
