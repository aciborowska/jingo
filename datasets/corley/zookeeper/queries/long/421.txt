the scripts in the test directory of zkpython are missing #! headers

Probably:

#!/bin/sh

for shell scripts and 

#!/usr/bin/python

for .py scripts?

Also include a shell script that will svn chmod the *.py scripts so that they can be executed individually from the command line (shortcut
rather than (python foo.py).
