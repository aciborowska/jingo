When setting up and using the zkpython binding, sometimes you encounter the problem that python cannot find the file "libzookeeper_mt.so.2". This can be fixed in most cases by for example adding the line "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/" to your .bashrc file. I some cases though, when for example running your python script from within a fcgi context and a lighttpd server it still isn't able to find the file.
