The dynamic reconfiguration feature is great.  But it doesn't seem to be possible to go from 1 server to 2 servers (1 server + 1 observer).  When there's only one server, ZK automatically starts in single server mode; when in single server mode trying to add a server causes a class cast exception because the server is a ZooKeeperServer, not a LeaderZooKeeperServer.
