In the case when a client connection is closed due to socket error instead of the client calling close explicitly, it would be nice to enable the session associated with that client to time out faster than the negotiated session timeout. This would enable a zookeeper ensemble that is acting as a dynamic discovery provider to remove ephemeral nodes for crashed clients quickly, while allowing for a longer heartbeat-based timeout for java clients that need to do long stop-the-world GC. 

I propose doing this by setting the timeout associated with the crashed session to "minSessionTimeout".
