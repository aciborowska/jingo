This issue is in response to ZOOKEEPER-801. Short version is a small number of buggy clients opened thousands of connections and caused Zookeeper to fail.

The misbehaving client did not correctly handle expired sessions, creating a new connection each time. The huge number of connections exacerbated the issue.
