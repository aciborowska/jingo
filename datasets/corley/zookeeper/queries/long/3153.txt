In this sub-task we have to transform the Forrest XML documents into MarkDown (.md) files and provide a (maven based) solution to create HTML documentation from them.

PDF support is dropped since it is not really used and makesÂ everything overcomplicated.

The generated HTML content should look similar to the one generated from Forrest XMLs, but not needed to be identical with them.
