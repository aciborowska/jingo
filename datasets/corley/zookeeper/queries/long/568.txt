Noticed the following issues in SyncRequestProcessor

1) logCount is incremented even for non-log events (say getData)
txnlog should return indication if request was logged or not (if hdr ==null it returns)

also:

2) move r.nextInt below logCount++ (ie if an actual log event)
3) fix indentation after txnlog.append (for some reason has unnecessary 4 char indent)
