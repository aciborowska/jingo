Hello,:
    I plan to use zookeeper for distributed consistency in one project, but the project requires proxies to be used for communication between the zookeeper servers and between the server and the client. After the actual test, zookeeper servers can communicate with each other normally through socks5 socket proxy , but zookeeper client and server can not communicate with each other normally through the same socks5 socket proxy, I find that the zookeeper client and server communicate with each other through java nio or netty, and java nio/netty is different from java io in the use of proxy.
    so,whether zookeeper client-server nio or netty communication can use socket proxies?
    Remarks:the zookeeper version I use is 3.4.6.
