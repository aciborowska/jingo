We're seeing the output of stat on one node return a negative value for min latency time:

stat 
Zookeeper version: 3.4.6-1569965, built on 02/20/2014 09:09 GMT
Clients:
...
Latency min/avg/max: -477/149/261002

(The max value seems suspicious, too.)

Figured I'd report this, as I don't see any mention of it online or in other bug reports. Maybe negative values shouldn't be recorded?
