0 does not correspond to any of the defined states for the zookeeper handle, so a client should not expect to see this value. But in the function handle_error, we set zh->state = 0, which a client may then see. Instead, we should set our state to be ZOO_CONNECTING_STATE. 

At some point the code moved away from 0 as a valid state and introduced the defined states. This broke the fix to ZOOKEEPER-800, which checks if state is 0 to know if the handle has been created but has not yet connected. We now use ZOO_NOTCONNECTED_STATE to mean this, so the check for this in zoo_add_auth must be changed.

We saw this error in 3.4.6, but I believe it remains present in trunk.
