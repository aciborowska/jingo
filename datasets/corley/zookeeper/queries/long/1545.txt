if I deploy two application(both use zookeeper) to same tomcat,zookeeper in one app will inexplicable disconnect when tomcat startup.

following is my code,it is very simple:

public class ZKTester implements InitializingBean, Watcher {

    private ZooKeeper hZooKeeper;

    public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception 
{
        hZooKeeper = new ZooKeeper("localhost:2181", 300000, this);
    }

    public void process(WatchedEvent event) 
{
        System.out.println("**************" + event);
    }

and the spring config file:

<bean id="zooTester" class="com.abc.framework.cluster.ZKTester"/>

And following is tomcat's startup log:

...
**************WatchedEvent state:Disconnected type:None path:null
**************WatchedEvent state:Expired type:None path:null
...
