When starting an embedded QuorumPeerMain by executing the runFromConfig() and providing QuorumPeerConfig properties:

standaloneEnabled=false
initLimit=5
syncLimit=2
clientPort=4101
server.1=nlbantpijl01.infor.com:2101:3101:participant;4101
dataDir=/Storage/zookeeper/server001

an NullPointerException is thrown in the QuorumPeerConfig class in the method backupOldConfig() because the property configFileStr is null.

A check must be made at the start of the method backupOldConfig() if the property configFileStr is null. If so just exit the method. In the embedded mode there is no config file, so no need to create a backup.
