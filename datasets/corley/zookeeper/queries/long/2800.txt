I deploy a cluster of ZooKeeper with three nodes:

ofs_zk1:30.0.0.72
ofs_zk2:30.0.0.73
ofs_zk3:30.0.0.99

On 2017-06-02, use the c zk client to create some ephemeral sequential nodes,:
/adm_election/rolemgr/rolemgr0000000008,
/adm_election/rolemgr/rolemgr0000000011,
/adm_election/rolemgr/rolemgr0000000012,

with sesstion timeout 20000 ms.

Then  I restart ofs_zk1 and ofs_zk2.


On 2017-06-05, I found that, these ephemeral  nodes still exist on ofs_zk1.
I can check the nodes by zkCli.sh get command on ofs_zk1.
But these nodes doesn't not exist on ofs_zk2 and ofs_zk3.
Is it odd?


I have upload the whole deploy directory of three nodes to:
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1miohiCo ,
The log is printed in log/zookeeper.out

log of ofs_zk3 is too large, so I only show the head 1000 lines.

Since I find this PR a little late, some snapshot and log may be deleted.
I hope anyone can help find the reason.
