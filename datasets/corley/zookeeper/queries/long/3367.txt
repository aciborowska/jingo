Pulling in Zookeeper 3.4.14 in a Maven build results in spotbugs-annotations also being pulled in as a dependency.


[INFO] - org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper:jar:3.4.14:compile
[INFO]    +- com.github.spotbugs:spotbugs-annotations:jar:3.1.9:compile

Since spotbugs-annotations is under LGPL license, it would ideally be used only during the build, and not be pulled in when users depend on Zookeeper.
