After applying the patch of ZOOKEEPER-569, I observed a failure of LETest. From a cursory inspection of the log, I can tell that a leader is being elected, but some thread is not joining. At this point I'm not sure if this is a problem with the leader election implementation or the test itself. 

Just to be clear, the patch of ZOOKEEPER-569 solved a real issue, but it seems that there is yet another problem with LETest.
