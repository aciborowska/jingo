I think reporting this stackoverflow question to the ZooKeeper team is important.

org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxnFactory.configure(InetSocketAddress, int) has the following code:

@Override
public void configure(InetSocketAddress addr, int maxcc) throws IOException {
    configureSaslLogin();

    thread = new Thread(this, "NIOServerCxn.Factory:" + addr);
    thread.setDaemon(true);
    maxClientCnxns = maxcc;
    this.ss = ServerSocketChannel.open();
    ss.socket().setReuseAddress(true);
    LOG.info("binding to port " + addr);
    ss.socket().bind(addr);
    ss.configureBlocking(false);
    ss.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT);
}



So the intention is to use SO_REUSEADDR. This does not work under linux (at least with the java version I use). The reason is that sun.nio.ch.ServerSocketChannelImpl.setOption(SocketOption<T>, T) used by ZooKeeper has this code:


public <T> ServerSocketChannel setOption(SocketOption<T> paramSocketOption, T paramT) throws IOException
{
    if (paramSocketOption == null)
        throw new NullPointerException();
    if (!(supportedOptions().contains(paramSocketOption)))
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("'" + paramSocketOption + "' not supported");
    synchronized (this.stateLock) {
        if (!(isOpen()))
            throw new ClosedChannelException();
        if ((paramSocketOption == StandardSocketOptions.SO_REUSEADDR) && (Net.useExclusiveBind()))
        {
            this.isReuseAddress = ((Boolean)paramT).booleanValue();
        }
        else {
            Net.setSocketOption(this.fd, Net.UNSPEC, paramSocketOption, paramT);
        }
        return this;
    }
}



"Net.useExclusiveBind()" seems to give back always false under linux no matter what value is set for sun.net.useExclusiveBind environment entry.

If someone wants to stop and start an embedded ZooKeeper server, it can result in BindExceptions. If there would be some workaround under Linux, it would be really good.

Also under windows the sun.net.useExclusiveBind env entry seems to be important to have the SO_REUSEADDR option. Maybe it would worth to document this network setting.

I have a test code which can reproduce the BindException under Linux.
