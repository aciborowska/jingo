The ZooKeeper interface provides no way to determine if the session is sasl authenticated or not. There is an event sent to the watcher when the sasl authentication completes, however there no way to determine if there is intent to negotiate via sasl. As a result the event cannot be used to wait to send messages until the authentication has completed. see HADOOP-8315
