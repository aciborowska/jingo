Noticed this while debugging a secure deploy. The server was started with the principal zk/_HOST

When a client tried to connect to this it tried to setup a secure connection to server zookeeper/_HOST and failed authentication.

In ClientCnxn.java


try {
                zooKeeperSaslClient = new ZooKeeperSaslClient("zookeeper/"+addr.getHostName());
            } catch (LoginException e) {
