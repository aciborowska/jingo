Using the git repo and checkout "branch-3.4", the "src/contrib/zooinspector/NOTICE.txt" file always shows up for changes but cannot be checkout or reset.

This is caused by ".gitattributes" line "text=auto" where git automatically sets the line ending stuff.

To solve this, I am gonna commit the git auto change and submit it as a patch for "branch-3.4".
