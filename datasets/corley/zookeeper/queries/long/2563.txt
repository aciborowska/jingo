delquota -[n|b] is not deleting the set quota properly

Steps to reproduce:-
1. Start zookeeper in cluster mode (ssl)
2. create some node say /test
3. Run command as listquota says (as expected)
quota for /test does not exist
4. setquota let say
setquota -n 10 /test
5. Now try to delete this as below
delquota -n /test
6. now check the quota

[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 1] listquota /test
absolute path is /zookeeper/quota/test/zookeeper_limits
Output quota for /test count=-1,bytes=-1
Output stat for /test count=1,bytes=5

7. Here it is not deleted quota node for test
8. Now try to set some new quota
It fails as it is not deleted correctly while delete

[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 3] setquota -n 11 /test
Command failed: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: /test has a parent /zookeeper/quota/test which has a quota

But through delquota it is able to delete
