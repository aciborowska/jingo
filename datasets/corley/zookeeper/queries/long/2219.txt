ZooKeeper server should better handle SessionMovedException.
We hit the SessionMovedException. the following is the reason for the SessionMovedException we find:
1. ZK client tried to connect to Leader L. Network was very slow, so before leader processed the request, client disconnected.
2. Client then re-connected to Follower F reusing the same session ID. It was successful.
3. The request in step 1 went into leader. Leader processed it and invalidated the connection created in step 2. But client didn't know the connection it used is invalidated.
4. Client got SessionMovedException when it used the connection invalidated by leader for any ZooKeeper operation.

The following are logs: c045dkh is the Leader, c470udy is the Follower and the sessionID is 0x14be28f50f4419d.
1. ZK client try to initiate session to Leader at 015-03-16 10:59:40,735 and timeout after 10/3 seconds.

2. ZK client initiated session to Follower successfully at 2015-03-16 10:59:44,688

3. At 2015-03-16 10:59:45,668, Leader processed the delayed request which is sent by Client at 2015-03-16 10:59:40,735, right after session was established, it close the socket connection/session because client was already disconnected due to timeout.

5. At 2015-03-16 10:59:45,710, we close the session 0x14be28f50f4419d but the socket connection between ZK client and ZK Follower is closed at 2015-03-16 10:59:45,715 after session termination.
logs from ZK Leader server:

It looks like Zk client is out-of-sync with ZK server.
My question is how ZK client can recover from this error. It looks like the ZK Client won't be disconnected from Follower until session is closed and any ZooKeeper operation will fail with SessionMovedException before session is closed.
Also since ZK Leader already closed the socket connection/session to ZK Client at step 3, why it still reject the ZooKeeper operation from client with SessionMovedException. Will it be better to endorse the session/connection between ZK client and ZK Follower? This seems like a bug to me.
