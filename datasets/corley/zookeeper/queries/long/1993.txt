1. Current implementation ignored and removed "clientPort" on parsing. For the sake of backward compatibility, "clientPort" should be kept and used upon parsing config on fresh boot.
2. When getting clientPort from both the old config and dynamic file, the one in dynamic file is of higher priority.
3. When "dynamicConfigFile" is set in zoo.cfg and not empty, standalone mode will be disabled.
