Currently, if a client is writing to multiple ledgers and these ledgers overlap on some bookie, there will be as many threads for such a bookie as the number of ledgers writing to it. Consequently, if a client writes to many ledgers simultaneously, it may end up with an undesirably large number of threads. I don't have a concrete proposal yet, but I suspect it is as simple as keeping an array of BookieHandle objects, one per bookie, and having each BookieHandle object shared by all ledgers.
