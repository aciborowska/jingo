Keep maintaining the old zoo.cfg.dynamic* files which will be getting created every time when "reconfig" is executed

Steps to reproduce:-1
1. Setup the zookeeper in cluster mode and start
2. trying running reconfig command like 
>reconfig -remove 3 -add 1=10.18.101.80:2888:3888;2181
3. It will create new zoo.cfg.dynamic in conf folder
The problem is it is not deleting the old zoo.cfg.dynamic* files which will keep eating the memory
