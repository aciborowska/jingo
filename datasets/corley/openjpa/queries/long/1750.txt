A prepared query with an enum parameter fails when exactly the same query is executed again. In other words, it works once, when the query is not cached yet.

The exception: org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: The specified parameter of type " ... " is not a valid query parameter.

An example query string is: 
select distinct a from MyClass a where a.state in (:STATE)
where the STATE is a list of enums.

There is a temporary workaround to bypass the cache with
query.setHint(QueryHints.HINT_IGNORE_PREPARED_QUERY, queryString);
