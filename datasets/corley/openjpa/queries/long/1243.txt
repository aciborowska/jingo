The following JIRAs need to be migrated back to the 1.0 line so that Informix can be used.  These fixes went into 1.2.0 and are stable.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-605
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-606
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-629

I have combined the 3 JIRA's into one patch to make the update easier.
