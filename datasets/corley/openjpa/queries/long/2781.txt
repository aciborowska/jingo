OpenJPA requires internet connection to understand correctly the namespaces in the persistence.xml.

It happens even if the schema location is a file inside the project.

A lot of tests were done and none of them worked without connecting to the internet.

I don't know if it is a bug or if this is the expected behavior.

Why does it happen? Please, give any feedback about it.
