The PCEnhancer fails when trying to enhance an entity bean found in a jar. It tries and fails to write the enhanced class output to the jar rather than the build directory of the project.

This means I cannot have my entity bean superclass in a seperate framework-centric project for re-use by all JPA-based projects, unless I enhance the class when jarring up the framework project. This would prevent me from sharing the jar with other JPA-based projects which don't use OpenJPA. 

I would recommend that the PCEnhancer checks the file path to write the enhanced class to before writing and removes any Jar-prefix if present, writing the class to the normal build directory.
