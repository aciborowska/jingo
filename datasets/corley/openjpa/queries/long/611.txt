In the following two situations, the behavior of  findBy with DataCache on is different from the same findBy with DataCache off:
(1) When there is @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn annotation on the relation fields:
Even though no relation is explicitly set in the application,  when retrieving from the database, the relation field will be populated. However, if DataCache is on, the relation fields will not be populated via findBy from data cache.

(2) When more than one fields are mapped to the same column with insertable=false or updateable=false: Setting different values to these fields will be saved in and restored from the datacache, but the the database will return only one value for these fields. 

The attached patch detects the above two situations and set the flag to instruct DataCacheStoreManager not to cache the instances of these kinds of entities so that the findBy operation for these two kinds of entities will always go to the database.
