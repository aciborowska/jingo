The "build" action in SchemaTool requires a data source connection to work even it does not need the connection to perform the "build" function. It would be a usability improvement to remove this requirement for the SchemaTool. This will also benefit other tools (e.g. MappingTool) that uses SchemaTool's build action under the cover.
