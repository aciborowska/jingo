Originally reported as OPENJPA-1410 - Class linkage exception when creating an EMF with OpenJPA M3

Experimentation and a quick search for similar issues is showing that use of the OpenJPA's agent enhancer with Tomcat never worked?!? The agent gets tied to the base class loader and enhances classes available to that loader at startup. Each app has their own lazily instantiated class loader. Enhancement has already taken place by the time those loaders get instantiated. This looked like a regression, but it it is actually a separate and much larger issue than the one raised in this JIRA. I will not pursue that issue at this time. 

Please verify that you no longer see the original problem/exception with latest 2.0 build. If you were relying on runtime enhancement you will need to re-enable it by specifying:
<property name="openjpa.RuntimeUnenhancedClasses" value="supported"/>

A more recommended solution is to enhance your entities at build time and set -
<property name="openjpa.DynamicEnhancementAgent" value="false"/>
<property name="openjpa.RuntimeUnenhancedClasses" value="unsupported"/>
