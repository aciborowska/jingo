Currently, native queries only allow you to execute via getResultList or getSingleResult.  Also allow execution through executeUpdate().  Original report:

I have a customer who is using Kodo 4.0.1 JPA and tried to use the following line to lock back end tables:

>     String sql = "LOCK TABLE  ...... IN EXCLUSIVE MODE";
>     Query q = em.createNativeQuery(sql);
>     q.executeUpdate();

But he got errors:

Caused by: <4|false|4.0.1> kodo.persistence.InvalidStateException: Cannot perform an update or delete operation on select query: "LOCK TABLE ....  IN EXCLUSIVE MODE".
