Persistence JDBC tests and other database connected tests have been suffering from slow down starting somewhere in September 2010 [1]. I can see this in my environment as well as Hudson builds:

OpenJPA-trunk-deploy: Build #49 (Nov 7, 2010 6:46:34 AM): OpenJPA Persistence JDBC: 34 min

OpenJPA-20x-deploy: Build #23 (Nov 5, 2010 7:14:48 PM): OpenJPA Persistence JDBC: 10 min

As seen above, the trunk build executes much slower than the 2.0.x build yet the number of tests is roughly the same and there are no significant differences in execution times of modules that do not touch database.
