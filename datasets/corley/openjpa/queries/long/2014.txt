I have a scenario where I am using LiteAutoDetach and there is a measurable amount of processing going into unproxying a few of my fields. I don't need to pay this penalty because once my persistence context ends all of my Entities are going to be gc'd.

With this change I'm going to add a configuration property to openjpa.DetachState so that I can selectively turn off unproxying on detach. This property will only work when LiteAutoDetach is enabled.
