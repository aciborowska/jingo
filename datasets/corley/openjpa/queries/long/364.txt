From the dev mailing list. (http://www.nabble.com/order-of-build-modules-isn%27t-quite-right-tf4416976.html).

In short, we are building the aggregate jar before we have built the 1.5 modules.  Details follow...  BTW, this only seems to apply to the trunk (1.1.0 snapshot).

Maybe if we create two profiles, one for 1.4 only and one for 5.0, and
just enable the appropriate one of them? This would increase
repetition (we could address that with XML entities, of course), but
might get things to run right.
