A method marked with @PostLoad or @PostUpdate on an object that is the toMany side of a bi-directional relationship does not get called when the other object is loaded or updated.

I can confirm that this problem was introduced by the changes done in OPENJPA-744. Looks like the StateManagerImpl.postLoad() method is not firing the event due to the bidirectional field not being flagged as loaded.

An example:

@Entity
public class Order {
  @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy = "order", fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
  public List<Shipment> getShipments() 
{
    return shipments;
  }
}

@Entity
public class Shipment {
  @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER, cascade = 
{ CascadeType.MERGE, CascadeType.REFRESH }
)
  public Order getOrder() 
{
    return order;
  }

  @PostLoad
  public void doSomethingAfterLoad() 
{
    // do something
  }
}

In the above example the doSomethingAfterLoad() never gets called when you load an Order. Without the changes done in OPENJPA-744 it does.
