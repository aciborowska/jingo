My application unit tests turned up some unexpected behavior from basic OpenJPA entity manager functions.  It appears, for instance, that a detached entity can still be refreshed.  I decided to write a few basic tests (attached) which report five potential errors.  This does not go into the testing of cascading behavior which would require additional work.
