OpenJPA includes a number of annotations that extend the behavior of the JPA specification. Currently, these annotations cannot be specified in an XML descriptor. We must create an XSD that allows XML-based configuration of these settings.

Additionally, to address OPENJPA-87, we should come up with a good story for when only spec-level XML is used and OpenJPA annotations are also used. Currently, as reported in OPENJPA-87, such a configuration causes us to ignore the OpenJPA annotations.
