Hi,

i have an entity which has a mapped superclass. In that superclass i have a 1:1 relation which is marked "lazy". 

Now when i load that entity, attach an object to that relation and persist it, the change is not reflected in the database. But the jpaversion is increased. Also all other "normal" mapped fields are persisted but not the Lazy 1:1. Of course i checked the object right before persist and it looks pretty perfect. 

If i remove the lazy attribute from the annotation. Everything works like expected. When looking at OPENJPA-2505 and this issue, i am really concerned about your FetchType implementation. This definitely feels buggy.

And to make things more weird: On my MySQL box, the bug is non-existant. As soon as i deploy the application (really the very same application) to MariaDB, its there.
