This is a follow-on Issue to OPENJPA-133.  Issue 133 was concerned with properly processing the xml configuration of callback methods.  As I was experimenting with that scenario, I discovered that our processing for annotated callback methods and xml callback methods is not consistent.  While we do parameter validation for the xml-configured callbacks, we do not do any validation of the annotated callback methods.  We just assume that the signature is valid.  An incorrectly configured annotated callback method is not detected until runtime and then the user will get an IllegalArgumentException.  It's good that we eventually catch and log this condition, but if we could do the validation earlier like we do for xml-configured callbacks, the user will know about the problem much earlier in the process.
