Currenlty openjpa will return an empty embeddable object as an entity attribute in the query result even if that embeddable attribute is lazily fetched. Moreover, the load bit in the StateManagerImpl is also on for that embeddable attribute. The expected behavior is that null value should be set to the embeddable attribute and the load bit should be off.
