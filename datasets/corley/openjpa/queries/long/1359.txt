The driver itself works with OpenJPA, except that the first time OpenJPA tries to obtain a connection it fails with the following exception :

Caused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "JDBC"
	at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:48)
	at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:447)
	at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:497)
	at org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.sql.SQLServerDictionary.connectedConfiguration(SQLServerDictionary.java:92)
	at org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.sql.DBDictionary.decorate(DBDictionary.java:4157)
	at org.apache.openjpa.lib.jdbc.DecoratingDataSource.decorate(DecoratingDataSource.java:100)

It seems like this method is trying to determine the diver vendor and database version, but fails with vendor/platform informations returned by this driver.

I'm using sqljdbc4.jar and the url in the format jdbc:sqlserver:// .

Despite the "then works" part, this initial exception seriously impairs OpenJPA usage with SQLServer in some scnarios, cause it often gets in the way of the initial schema analysis.

This has been solved in trunk, the patch could be quite simply backported to fix it in 1.2.2 .
