The MetamodelImpl.populate() method needs some improvements in the error processing arena.  This scenario is coming about due to the changes in OPENJPA-2027.  If our current 2.2.x runtime implementation runs against a metamodel class that was generated prior to the fix in OPENJPA-2027, the exception produced does not show what the error was (and we're missing the "caused by" exception).  These updates will help identify the root cause issue.
