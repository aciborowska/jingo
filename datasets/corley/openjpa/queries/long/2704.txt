 When both the orm.xml default schema and the 'openjpa.jdbc.Schema' property are set, OpenJPA now prefers the orm.xml default over the property. In the past (2.1.x) the persistence property was preferred over the orm.xml configuration, but that seems to have changed with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-2494. I believe that it makes more sense to have the persistence property overrule the orm.xml mapping file, not the other way around, so I am creating this JIRA to switch the behavior back.
