Selection.alias() according to latest JPA 2.0 creates new instances rather than adding an alias name to the receiver.
This apparently simple change can have a relatively large impact, because we maintain Selection terms keyed by its alias.
If we go for a delegation pattern to implement alias(), then all Selection derivations (quite a few of them) are to be delegated. 

Comments/thoughts?
