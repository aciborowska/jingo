Originally reported as GERONIMO-5553.
The following scenarios were verified by Jeremy Bauer -
1) When the Javaagent is used with a list of classes, only the provided list will get enhanced.
2( When the Javaagent is used without a list of classes, ALL classes will get enhanced.
3) When the dynamic enhancer via attach api is used with a list of classes, the provided list AND any discovered classes are enhanced (unless <exclude-unlisted-classes> is specified.)
4) When the dynamic enhancer via attach api is used without a list of classes, ALL classes will get enhanced.

So, the Javaagent is case #1 is behaving differently than case #3, which is what this JIRA should address.
