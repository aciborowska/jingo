According to the documentation (Part 3, chapter 7, paragraph 6), join criteria can be defined so that a column in the source or target table must have some constant value. The constant value should be specified in the attribute "referencedColumnName" of the @JoinColumn annotation. If the constant is a string then its value should be enclosed first in single quotes and then in double quotes like this:

@JoinColumn(name="table.column", referencedColumnName="'value'")

A numeric constant value needs just a single pair of double quotes:
@JoinColumn(name="table.column", referencedColumnName="2")


However a practical test shows that both options produce an error.
