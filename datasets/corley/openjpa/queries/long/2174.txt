Invalid index exception was thrown when it tried to retrieve the column data from the result set of a name native query. 

This is  because the attribute name defined in the entity is different from the actual column alas name defined in the query and  it didn't look up the result set mapping for the correct column name before retrieving the data.

the fix and test case is attached.
