I am trying to persist a streaming lob as written in the documentation. 

When I flush my session, I get the following: Caused by: org.apache.openjpa.lib.jdbc.ReportingSQLException: DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-270, SQLSTATE=42997, SQLERRMC=53, DRIVER=3.58.82 
{prepstmnt 27511927 SELECT t0.GMRU_LOG, t0.GMRU_NAME FROM MEASURES.GMRU_GO_METER_RUN t0 WHERE t0.GMRU_NAME = ?  FOR READ ONLY WITH RS USE AND KEEP UPDATE LOCKS [params=?]}
 [code=-270, state=42997]

According to :
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2.udb.apdv.java.doc/doc/tjvrsush.htm

it is not allowed to do a cursor fetch for lob attributes. However, this is done in order to ensure that there is a lock:
 public void updateClob { ... 
stmnt = sql.prepareStatement(conn, store.getFetchConfiguration(),
					ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);
