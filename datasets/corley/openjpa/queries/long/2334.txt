TheJPA Specification states in the javadoc for javax.persistence.spi.PersistenceUnitInfo methods getJarFileUrls() and getPersistenceUnitRootUrl():

"A URL will either be a file: URL referring to a jar file or referring to a directory that contains an exploded jar file, or some other URL from which an InputStream in jar format can be obtained."

Currently the method OpenJPA uses to identify PCTypes does not completely meet the specification requirements, and needs to be adapted to support non-file/jar URLs that provide jar-formatted InputStreams.
