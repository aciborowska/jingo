Rollback caused by application failure breaks the code as reported in [1].

It is to be ascertained whether this failure is caused only in runtime enhancement.

In either case, the exception handling must be improved than:

Caused by: <openjpa-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-r422266:765846M nonfatal general error> org.apache.openjpa.persistence.PersistenceException: null
