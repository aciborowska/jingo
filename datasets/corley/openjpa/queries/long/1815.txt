The enclosed archive is a stand-alone Maven project with three bundles demonstrating the use of OpenJPA in an OSGi environment, using the Apache Aries JNDI and JPA services to retrieve the data source from the OSGi service registry via JNDI and to publish the EntityManagerFactory of the persistence bundle in the service registry.

This project provides sample code for the setup strategy described in http://hwellmann.blogspot.com/2010/09/openjpa-and-osgi.html.

There is also an integration test based on Pax Exam, so the whole lot could be incorporated into the OpenJPA test suite (after changing some paths and delegating some settings to a higher-level parent POM).
