The bean validation is not working correctly

If you try to merge a new entity.

        EntityManager em = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();
        Person person = new Person();
        person.setName("Oliver");                               // Employee.name is annotated @NotNull 
        person = em.merge(person);                            

you get a ConstraintValidationException, although name is set.
