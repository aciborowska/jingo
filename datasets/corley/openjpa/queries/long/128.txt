It'd be nice to have some means to automatically pre-fill the cache when a node starts up, either by copying from a different node or from a serialized image on disk, or by issuing some pre-specified queries. I really like the idea of just letting the user specify something like so:

<property key="openjpa.DataCacheWarmUp" value="\"SELECT p FROM Person p\", \"SELECT p FROM Product p ORDER BY p.salesRank\""/>

Although in that last example, we'd really want some way to specify a bit more detail about which pages of the data to use, as you would in single-string JDOQL.
