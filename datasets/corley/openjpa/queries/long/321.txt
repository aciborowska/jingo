Via the JPA TCK running against DB2, we found the following problem with casting and the ABS function:

Instead of generating:
..WHERE (CAST(t0.TOTALPRICE AS DOUBLE) > CAST(ABS AS DOUBLE)) 

We need to generate:
..WHERE (CAST(t0.TOTALPRICE AS DOUBLE) > ABS(CAST(? AS DOUBLE)) 

While doing a bit more investigation we are finding similar problems with other function expressions such as MOD and TRIM.
