model object fields are not defaulting to allow null, even when I explicity set @Column(nullable=true), it still generates the columns as "not null".

As an example :
@Column(nullable = true, length = 128)
private String dataType;

results in generated sql of :
dataType VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL

This happens for both org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver, and org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver. As a test, I changed the driver to the MySql driver and everything worked as expected so I'm fairly sure this is not a configuration / setup issue unless there's special configuration required for derby.
