in OPENJPA-1900 I found out that we do not enhance our entities with the configuration which get used later while running the unit tests.

But enhancing sometimes has a huge implication on the behaviour! Thus we should always try to use the same persistence.xml for enhancing as we do for running the unit tests.

This small patch fixes the usage for our proxy tests which use openjpa.DetachState=fetch-groups (leading to Externalizable entities)
