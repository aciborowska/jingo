There are two tables A and B, I need to execute sql like
"insert into A select ... from B".
I use JPQL Constructor Expressions,
select new A(...) from B, got A list then persist.
But some fields of A depends on program context, not direct from B, so SELECT NEW clause should look like these :
select new A(B.column1, 'xxx') from B, or
select new A(null, B.column2) from B, or
select new A(variable, B.column2) from B.

Unfortunately, OpenJPA doesn't support this.
I have to get the result object[] list and constuct A in my code now. 

If JPQL Constructor Expressions become more powerful, my code  will be more simple then.
