Currently, when defining the entity id in a parent class (mapped superclass), the native sequence type generates only one sequence which will be used by all enties/tables. The only possibility to have a sequence per class-hierarchy is by using a table sequence. In databases that support native sequence objects it is more natural to use such sequences rather than sequence tables. It would be nice if openjpa would provide a "class-hierarchy-native" sequence type which will use a sequence per mapped table.
