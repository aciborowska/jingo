See OPENJPA-144. It would seem that in a WebSphere environment, when specifying a non-jta-data-source, the JDBC connection that OpenJPA looks up does not permit calls to Connection.commit(). This, in conjunction with OPENJPA-149, means that in a default configuration, OpenJPA cannot use non-JTA data sources in a WebSphere environment.
