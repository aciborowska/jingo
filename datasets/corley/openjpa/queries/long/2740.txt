We are using OpenJPA to manage a relational database for an offline desktop application.

OpenJPA does not works on Linux OS on which /etc/hosts file is having incorrect configuration.

 

We have observed that, it works if the file is not present or empty.

 

The application we have developed does not require any internet connection hence we want OpenJPA to work even if the host name resolution is not done.

 

The OpenJPA API does not provides any such option to override default configuration for hostname resolution or an option to indicate that the database being used is an offline database.

 

Please suggest any resolution for this issue.
