I just tried the JSE version of the OpenBooks example (../openjpa-examples/openbooks) and it turns out that we're missing the SLF4J runtime dependency in our openjpa-all jar file.  This SLF4J dependency comes about because of our dependency on Bean Validation (bval).  We're pulling in the SLF4J API from slf4j-api, but we're missing the runtime from slf4j-simple.

There are two resolutions to this.  We can modify the ../openjpa-all/pom.xml to include the following dependency:

            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
                <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
                <version>${slf4jVersion}</version>
            </dependency>

Or, we can tell OpenJPA that OpenBooks does not depend on bean validation (which it doesn't).  We can do this via this additional configuration property in the persistence.xml for the OpenBooks sample:

    <validation-mode>NONE</validation-mode>

The most complete solution is to modify the pom.xml when building the openjpa-all jar.  The unfortunate thing with this approach is that we have already released 2.2.0 which already is missing this slf4j runtime.  Maybe we'll just have to add a "readme" to that download.  We can fix it in 2.2.x and trunk though.  And, if somebody hits this with the 2.2.0 release, hopefully they are not using bean validation and they can set the validation-mode to NONE.
