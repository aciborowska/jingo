FindBugs is reporting this error on our enhanced classes.  The pcIsDetached() method appears to be the culprit.  Details about the error:

A method that returns either Boolean.TRUE, Boolean.FALSE or null is an accident waiting to happen. This method can be invoked as though it returned a value of type boolean, and the compiler will insert automatic unboxing of the Boolean value. If a null value is returned, this will result in a NullPointerException.
