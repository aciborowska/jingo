Per Kevin's comment in the OpenJPA 1.2.2 release vote [1] our binary distribution contains a large amount of documentation files (roughly 90% of the archive is docs). Kevin posed the question of whether other Apache projects include docs in their distributions.

So I took a random (and small) sampling : 


	HTTPServer only delivers binaries for Windows as a .msi file - I'm not sure whether the docs are included there or not.
	Ant 1.8.0-RC1 includes documentation in the binary distribution.
	Derby 10.5.3.0 includes documentation in the binary distribution
	OpenEJB 3.1.2 does not include documentation in the binary distribution



The results don't show a clear trend (maybe a larger sample size would reveal one), but it looks like we have leeway here to include or omit documentation in our releases. 

Also FWIW OpenEJB and Derby's binary distributions are roughly the same size as OpenJPA 1.2.2 (around 18MB), Ant is a bit smaller (around 7 MB). 

Removing all docs would put the size around 5.8 MB, removing just the javadoc (the larger portion of documentation) puts the size around 11 MB.
