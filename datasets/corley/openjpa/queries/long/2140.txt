The openjpa-persistence-locking module includes a persistence.xml which uses pu name "test".  This pu name is used in the base persistence.xml from openjpa-persistence-jdbc.  Since both are on the classpath, this leads to a bunch of messages in the build log indicating that there's a duplicate pu.  I'm modifying the o-p-l module to use a unique pu name.
