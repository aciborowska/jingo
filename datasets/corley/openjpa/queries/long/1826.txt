When I see the type="text" attribute in a Hibernate property element I would like to be able to convert that to a <lob/> child element in OpenJPA.

For example, I would like the following line in a Hibernate hbm.xml file:

<property name="value" column="VALUE" type="text"/>

to become the following orm.xml entry:

      <basic name="value">
        <column name="VALUE"/>
        <lob/>
      </basic>

I can get <lob/> by using this in the actions for "property" in migration-actions.xml:

    <promote-attr from="type" to="lob">
      <map-value from="text"  to=""/>
    </promote-attr>

but that will only work if type's value is "text".  It would be great if we could introduce a new type in migration-actions.xsd: "ignore-value".  We can already ignore elements and attributes, but not values yet (unless they have particular values like the example above).  Then I could do something like this:

    <promote-attr from="type" to="lob">
      <ignore-value/>
    </promote-attr>
