When selecting multiple entities A which contain a @MapKey field for entity B, the inverse relation from B to A will only be set for the first entity A, when using parallel eager select. This is because all entity B objects are created when loading the 1st entity A object, with the inverse relation to be set later in setInverseRelation(), but setInverseRelation() is looking for Collection fields only, so the Map fields are ignored.
