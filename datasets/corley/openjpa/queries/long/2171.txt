openjpa uses since some versions asm but in tomee for instance we use a shade (through the xbean one org.apache.xbean:xbean-asm-shaded to avoid classloading/version issues with webapps/applications.

it can be nice if openjpa can provide us an issue to this because we really don't want to provide asm in our binaries.

solutions can be to use the xbean shade, give us an interface to implement or to try several implementation (xbean shade, asm,...) by reflection
