When invoking EntityManager.flush(), all dirty instances are flushed. This can be inconvenient when working in an application with multiple distinct modules that may need to flush for query purposes.

OpenJPA should provide an OpenJPAEntityManager.flush(Class... classesToFlush) API that limits the flushes to just the specified classes.
