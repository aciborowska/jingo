As discussed (somewhat vaguely) here in the eclipse..dali newsgroup, openjpa implementations can provide a platform plugin which would allow some added functionality while using the dali component of eclipse -

I wish I could say that I know enough about the eclipse internals and plugin development to give this a crack myself. The one thing that stands out the most is that I would like to right-click in eclipse and do a 'Generate DDL.' The option is available, but when run, eclipse tells me that the generic platform does not allow this sort of functionality. This would be a great addition and would make things a bit easier.
