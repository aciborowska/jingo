I was looking for the latest builds, and I could not find the snapshot builds.

Michael Dick then replied:

The snapshot repository was lost when we moved to a different machine for
nightly builds (you can see that the snapshots haven't been updated since
August). I'll work on getting them published in subsequent builds. If you
have a JIRA account would you mind opening an issue?
