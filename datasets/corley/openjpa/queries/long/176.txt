OpenJPA prefixes all exception messages with a string of the form "<exception type|is fatal|version>", restulting in strings like "<4|false|0.9.6-incubating> org.apache.openjpa.persistence.PersistenceException". This isn't very useful to the casual observer, since no translation of the meaning of the fields is done.

it would be nice if we translated the fatal and type parameters, so that the string looked like "<user-error|recoverable|0.9.6-incubating>".
