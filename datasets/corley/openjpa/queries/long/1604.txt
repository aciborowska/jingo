 I ran a testcase against openjpa 1.2, and found that the "for update" clause is appended to the SQL when

 		<property name="openjpa.LockManager" value="pessimistic"/>

	is added to the persistence.xml without calling: 

		 q.setLockMode(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE);

However, this behavior changes when running against trunk level code
