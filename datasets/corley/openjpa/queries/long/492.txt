JPQL does not allow scalar functions to be used in SELECT clauses. This can be useful in and of itself. Additionally, relational databases typically require that any functions used in a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause are also used in the SELECT clause; paralleling this in JPQL seems to make sense.

Example:

select substring(o.stringField, 1, 1), count(o) from AllFieldTypes o
    group by substring(o.stringField, 1, 1)
