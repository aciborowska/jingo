Based on the discussion in thread http://www.nabble.com/Performance%3A-single-vs-multiple-transactions-tf4272115.html
I've created a testcase, which is attached. It includes a "Performance results flush.txt" which gives an overview of the the performance results. In general, using flush() within one transaction with many changes the performance drops quite significantly (x 15). 

Btw, not sure which OpenJPA version this is. It is based on Kodo jdo version 4.1.4
