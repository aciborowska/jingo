TableJDBCSeq has a locking problem where multiple threads can run on top of each other resulting in all keys not being used for a given sequence. 

While unit testing a fix I also uncovered another theoretical start up problem where multiple threads can try to insert the same row into the DB resulting in a duplicate key exception.
