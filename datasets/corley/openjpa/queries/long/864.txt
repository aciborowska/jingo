The following query does not generate the correct SQL with Oracle : 
"SELECT e,d from Employee e, Dependent d "
                + "WHERE e.empId = :empid "
                + "AND d.id.empid = (SELECT MAX (e2.empId) FROM Employee e2) "
                + "AND d.id.effDate > :minDate "
                + "AND d.id.effDate < :maxDate ";

The problem will exist with any DBDictionary that uses JoinSyntaxes.SYNTAX_DATABASE (no joins will be created for Dependent).
