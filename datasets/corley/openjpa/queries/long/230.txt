When an application is commiting a transaction and then terminating, often not all events regarding Data Cache are dispatched by the TCPRemoteCommitProvider. It seems that the JVM on termination is not waiting until TCPRemoteCommitProvider has dispatched all events regarding Data Cache. In this way some cache synchronization is lost.
