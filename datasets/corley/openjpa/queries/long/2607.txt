Currently the import for javax.transaction looks like this:
javax.transaction.*;version="[1.1.0,1.2)";resolution:=optional

Unfortunately this makes openjpa incompatible with jta 1.2 which should be compatible for a consumer. As the Aries blueprint transaction support now uses jta 1.2 it does not work with openjpa.

I just change the import range on trunk and tested using the aries itests. 
It seems openjpa works fine with jta 1.2 if the import range is corrected like below:
javax.transaction.*;version="[1.1.0,2)";resolution:=optional

I only tested with trunk (2.4.1-SNAPSHOT) but the increased range should work for 2.3.x and 2.2.x too.
