OpenJPA supports a number of extensions beyond what is provided in the spec. Some of these are in the form of additional APIs, but others are in the form of JPQL syntax, XML parsing, and other non-Java-validatable constructs. It would be useful to provide configuration options to control the level of spec compliance. This issue serves as an umbrella to track such configuration options.
