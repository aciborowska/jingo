The changes for OpenJPA-179 (revision 525006) fix the problem where default schemas are not processed at all, however there are still some issues.

1. The persistence-unit-defaults only apply to entities within the xml descriptor, they will not apply to annotated entities which are in the same persistence unit. 

2. In order to override the default schema the table name must be specified. 

These issues still need to be addressed, but can wait until after version 0.9.7 to be resolved.
