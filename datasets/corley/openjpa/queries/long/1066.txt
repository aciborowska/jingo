Several DB's allow a generated id column to start with 0.

For instance, DB2 allows  "GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (START WITH 0)...."

When this is used, the very first object will have an id of 0.  When entities are first created, the user usually won't fill in the corresponding id field (since it will be generated by the DB when the entity is put in the DB), so it defaults to 0.  The entity manager then uses this 0 and sees that an entity already exists and will update the old entity in stead of creating a new one.

This is not a large issue, because a user could simply specify "START WITH 1" as a very simple workaround or they could use an Integer instead of an int, but it would be nice to fix so that new users don't hit this problem.
