I have BaseFacDto class with defined properties. I have sub-class FacDto (entity) extending BaseFacDto. 

public abstract class BaseFacDto {
	@Column(name="FAC_NAME")
	public String facName;
â€”
}

@Entity
@Table(name="FAC")
public class FacDto extends BaseFacDto implements Serializable {
	public FacDto(){}
	@Id @Column(name="FAC_ID", nullable = false)
	private String facId;
	@Column(name="FAC_ADDRESS")
	private String facAddress;
	@Column(name="LABID")
}

Questions:
1. When the query   fac = clep.find(FacDto.class, facId);    I don't see FAC_NAME in the logged SQL generated.  Since Base class has this variable, so sub-class also get it by inheritance.  Please verify. I have define it like this in base class
       @Column(name="FAC_NAME")
	private String facName; 

2. I also tried this thing. I created the variable in the sub-class without getter-setter. Now I see the FAC_NAME in the sql log. But the issue now is when I execute getter methods ( inherited from base class). the value is always null.
        @Column(name="FAC_NAME")
	private String facName;

3. How OpenJPA different from JPA. I see that all OpenJpa sample uses the javax.persistance.jar (JPA jar). I am little confused over this. Please clarify

Please help. 
Thanks in advance
