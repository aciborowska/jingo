The JavaDoc for FetchPlan defines the following contract:

    /**

	Clears the set of fetch group names to use wen loading
	data. After this operation is invoked, only those fields in
	the default fetch group (and any requested field) will be
	loaded when loading an object.
     */
    public FetchPlan clearFetchGroups();



After calling clearFetchGroups() the default fetch group is indeed active, however getFetchGroups() returns an empty Collection, which is clearly not correct.  This can deceive application developers into thinking that there is no active Fetch Groups (it, everything is lazy loaded) if this Collection's contents is relied upon.
