It should be possible to set query hints in Java code, or in orm.xml, but it seems the orm:hint element is ignored.

The following two options should result in the same query:

	Java only:

em.createQuery("Select e from MyEntity e where e.type = 'literal'")
  .setHint(QueryHints.HINT_USE_LITERAL_IN_SQL, true)
  .getResultList()


	Named query
	
		Define the query and the hint in orm.xml

<named-query name="Query1">
    <query>Select e from MyEntity e where e.type = 'literal'</query>   
    <hint name="openjpa.hint.UseLiteralInSQL" value="true" />
</named-query>


		And then call the query without additional information

em.createNamedQuery("Query1")
  .getResultList()


	
	



However, (2) does not correctly take the query hint into account and thus literals are replaced with SQL positional parameters.
