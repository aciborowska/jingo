Slice gives us an abstraction for using horizontally partitioned databases. As of now we use hints to set targets for a particular query if we want it to be fired on  particular Slices(partitions). This method works fine but we need to have something which works from outside the user code as in the case of distribution policy. If we have such a way we can externally set targets without changing the code. Such targeting should be available for select and find.
