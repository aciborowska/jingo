DeltaSpike's started seeing a query failure when testing against TomEE 7 M3.  The test result can be seen here: https://builds.apache.org/job/DeltaSpike_TomEE_7.0.0-M3/140/org.apache.deltaspike.modules$deltaspike-data-module-impl/testReport/org.apache.deltaspike.data.impl.criteria/CriteriaTest/should_create_count_criteria/

The query generated looks something like 


select count(distinct e.name) from Simple e where e.name = ?



OpenJPA seems to be trying to convert the long into a long via constructor
