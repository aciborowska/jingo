I have a simple test program that uses OpenJPA 0.9.6 to insert an object into a db in one transaction (t1) and retrieve it in another transaction (t2).  The program hangs in 30-50% of the executions right before the call to entitymanager.find() (used to retrieve the object in t2).  I'm using OpenJPA runtime enhancement.


By looking at the JVM dump, I can see the following deadlock:
