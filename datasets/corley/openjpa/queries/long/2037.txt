We have a hierarchical table CT_LOCATION (database scheme and corresponding jpa configuration are placed into table_scheme.gif and jpa_config.txt attachments)

There is a JPQL-query to get children by a parent location:
    <named-query name="locationManagement.getLocations">
		<query>select item from Location item where item.superLocation.id = :locationSuperLocationId</query>
    </named-query>

The parameter locationSuperLocationId can be set to NULL to return all root locations. When we use following execution sequence the query discontinues to return root items:
Step 1: Set locationSuperLocationId to NULL and get all root elements. Query result is NOT EMPTY.
Step 2: Fill locationSuperLocationId with actual parent id and execute query. Repeat this step TWO OR MORE TIMES.
Step 3: Set locationSuperLocationId to NULL again and get all root elements. The query result will be EMPTY.

On step 1 openjpa uses IS NULL construction to get data from the database. But on step 3 it does not. Execution log is placed in to execution_log.txt atachment.
