The code currently reads:
// connect if the connection is currently null, or if
// the connection has been closed out from under us
if (_conn == null)
    _conn = connectInternal();

The comment indicates that it should check for null or closed, but the code only checks for closed. Our application got to the state where connection was actually closed but not null. We patched this with the following code to make it work:

if (_conn == null || _conn.isClosed())
    _conn = connectInternal();
