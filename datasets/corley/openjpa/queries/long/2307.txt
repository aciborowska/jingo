The download page http://openjpa.apache.org/downloads.html contains links to several snapshot builds.

These presumably have not been voted on; as such they are not proper ASF releases and must not be advertised to the general public.

They are only intended for use by developers and should only appear (if at all) in pages which are clearly for developers only.
