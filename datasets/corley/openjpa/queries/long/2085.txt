Java 7 requires StackMapTable attribute to be set in class file for verification.

Serp does not support StackMapTable generation, hence the currently enhanced PersistenceCapable class will NOT be able to load by a Java 7 JVM if the entity is compiled with a Java 7 compiler (i.e. class file major version >= 51)
