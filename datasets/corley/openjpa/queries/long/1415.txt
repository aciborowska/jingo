I have a customer application where under some circumstances expected OptimisticLockExceptions occur and are handled by the application, but OpenJPA does a fair amount of exception processing. With this JIRA, I'm adding a new property/testcase to cut down on the exception text that is generated when batched OLEs are encountered.
