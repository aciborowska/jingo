The SchemaTool obtains a new connection for each table it creates, then again for each index on each table, and again for each FK, and so on. 

The impact of obtaining multiple connections can be reduced by using a connection pool but it's still quite noticeable when running our unit tests when the schema tool runs for each test method.
