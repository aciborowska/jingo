The fix for OPENJPA-665 exposed another issue with checking for null. If the entity contains a "read-only" attribute (insertable=false, updatable=false) should we also check whether the value is null? 

A practical use case for this is a Date attribute which is automatically generated by the database, ie 

@Column(insertable=false, updatable=false, nullable=false, columnDefinition="LAST_UPD DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE")
private Date lastUpdated;

Before the fix for OPENJPA-665 such an attribute would not be checked for null.
