I've only seen this as an issue when using Oracle's XMLType and using openjpa.jdbc.SchemaFactory=native to build mapping information from the database. There may be other ways this problem can be exposed.

Recent versions of the JDBC driver for Oracle return 2007 as the DATA_TYPE for XMLType column (observed on 11.2.0.1.0). Earlier versions (10.2.0.3.0) returned java.sql.Types.OTHER. What's odd is that I don't see 2007 as a defined constant  for java.sql.Types - as a result OpenJPA throws an exception citing an unknown column type. It's not clear to me whether this is a bug in the JDBC driver or something we need to adapt to, or whether 2007 was just a holding place for Types.SQLXML (which is set to 2009). 

As a workaround we can treat 2007 as Types.OTHER for Oracle (at least for OpenJPA 1.2.x).
