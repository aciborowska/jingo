When running the SchemaToolÂ for db initialization, an exception is reported:


MySQLNonTransientConnectionException: Can't call rollback when autocommit=true


No tables are created, and the OpenJPA initialization fails.

The problem is originated in SchemaTool#executeSQL where a rollback is issued before any DDL statement is effectively run, and this causes troubles to MySQL.

Prior to version 8, the MySQL JDBC Driver used to provide a property relaxAutocommit=true to append to the JDBC URL, which could be leveraged as workaround; now this option was removed.
