our entities have share super class,the class has one field define the entity id,so we define the class as mappedsuperclass
when we work with hibernate JPA,it work fine.
but migrate to openjpa,the PCEnhancer don't assign other entity has ID class,so the query sql is incorrect.
example:
@MappedSuperclass
public EntityBase {
    @Id
    @Column(name="ID")
    private String id;
}

@Entity
public B extends EntityBase {

}

@Entity
public C extends EntityBase {

}

Object o = em.find(B.class, "111");
the sql list:
select * from A where id=?
select * from B where id=?
