Unenhanced OneToMany fields are not loaded when using a new entity manager.  The fields appear to work when reusing a resource local em across multiple transactions, but when a new em is created the OneToMany field will be null.

Attached is a test case that reproduces this problem.  The test method has been disabled so the build will not break.
