We are trying to circumvent N+1 query problem by making cache more 1-m relations aware. We have a working solution, but it would be much more elegant if the datacache classes were much more expandable, i.e. is DataCacheManagerImpl very private and this with a specialized code in the AbstractDataCache that is supposed to be the base for cache expandability does not help, i.e. we have there:

...

if(manager instanceof DataCacheManagerImpl){

...

 

Could you please refactor so all cache fields to be protected, especially in this class? We can send a patch as well.

Once we have a working solution for N+1 problem we can share it, it looks promising, but we are still unsure about certain corner cases. 

Thanks
