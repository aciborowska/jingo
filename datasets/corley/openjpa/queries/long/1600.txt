Enhancer currently does not read class bytes if they are packaged in a jar file. 
Enhancing an entity that resides inside a jar and overwriting the enhanced byte code inside the same jar is somewhat difficult.
But as a first step, we can read the byte code for entities that are merely used as serializeable reference to other persistent entities.
An issue of this nature has been reported in the user forum [1].
