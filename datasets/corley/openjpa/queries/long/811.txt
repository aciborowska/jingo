An entity has a field defined as follows:

@Column(nullable=false)
private Object  nonNullableObject;

Using Oracle, it is possible to set the value of this column to null. OpenJPA will not complain, but will instead store whatever is returned by oracle.sql.BLOB.empty_lob().

An exception should be thrown instead, because the field has been defined as non-nullable.
