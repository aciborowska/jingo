Allow users to provide their own Surefire excludes list through an external file.
This can be accomplished by using the gmaven-plugin and some Groovy code.
The default set of excludes will still be provided and used by default in the builds, but will be moved to src/test/resources/excludes.xml.
Users can provide their own version of excludes file by:
mvn -DsurefireExcludesFile=<filename>
where <filename> could be a local file like:
-DsurefireExcludesFile=/tmp/excludes.xml
or from a network share like:
-DsurefireExcludesFile=/mnt/public/openjpa-persistence-jdbc/excludes.xml
