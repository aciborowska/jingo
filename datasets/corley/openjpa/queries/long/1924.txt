I reviewed the code in

  org.apache.openjpa.persistence.osgi

and could not find a point, why the code in BundleUtils.getBundleClassLoader() uses yet-another implmementation of a class loader (BundleDelegatingClassLoader) in order to acces the class laoder of the openjpa bundle.

IMHO, BundleUtils.getBundleClassLoader() should simply read

    public static ClassLoader getBundleClassLoader() {

        if (runningUnderOSGi()) 
{
           return BundleUtils.class.getClassLoader();
        }
       else 
{
           return null;
       }
    }

rendering the BundleDelegatindClassLoader class and the PersistenceActivator.getBundleClassLoader() method useless.

Rationale: BundleUtils is a class, that lives inside the openjpa bundle and therefore has been loaded by the OSGi framework using a class loader, which knows the bundle's class and furthermore delegates to the imported packages from other bundles or the OSGi framework, aka the bundle class loader.

Simplifying the code like suggested is not a big leap, but it helps to keep the code small and readable
