Currently the DataCache EvictionSchedule only allows for a CRON style syntax. 
For example: To evict my cache every 10 minutes I would need to set : EvictionSchedule="10,20,30,40,50,60 * * * *" 

I'd like to support an interval syntax which would allow a user to say 'Run every [x] minutes.' After looking through the code it would easy enough to support EvictionSchedule="+[x]".  (x in minutes)

I also found that the testcase for the DataCacheScheduler has never been enabled. I'm not certain whether it wasn't enabled because it takes so long to run, or whether there are other bugs.
