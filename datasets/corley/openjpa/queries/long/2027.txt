This is the runtime portion of the problem reported in OPENJPA-2025. 

The problem here is that every array is treated as a list attribute. If the array is annotated with the @PersistentCollection annotation it makes sense to treat it like the other collection types, but in the case of an un-annotated byte[] (blob), or char[] (varchar), it makes more sense to use a SingularAttribute.
