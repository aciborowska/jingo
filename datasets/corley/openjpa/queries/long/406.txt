This started as a discussion on the dev mailing list:  http://www.nabble.com/em.refresh%28%29-semantics-tf4571479.html

It seems that when the automatic runtime enhancement kicks in (because the Entity was not pre-enhanced nor run through a classloading transformer), then changes to the Entity are not properly detected and the refresh() method does not process correctly.  A simple change to the TestPersistence testcase demonstrates this problem (if you don't pre-enhance the class).  I will attach my testcase diagnostic patch to this Issue.

More background details and discussion can be found in the mailing list archive.
