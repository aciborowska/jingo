I am trying to generate beans by connecting to Oracle DB. In the logs i see that its trying to resolve Primary keys, Indexes and foreign keys. However, does not find any foreign keys for the tables having FKs.

I checked the code and found below:
File: org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.sql.OracleDictionary.java
Method:  public ForeignKey[] getImportedKeys(DatabaseMetaData meta, DBIdentifier catalog,
        DBIdentifier schemaName, DBIdentifier tableName, Connection conn, boolean partialKeys)

Line#951
setString(stmnt, idx++, convertSchemaCase(tableName), null);

I think we should use unqualified tableName, since the query to fetch the FKs returns no result for qualified table names.

setString(stmnt, idx++, convertSchemaCase(tableName.getUnqualifiedName()), null);
