This issue is very similar to that of OPENJPA-1501, with one twist.......I've found that when you have an Embeddable, which has Strings as the keys/ids, openJPA code puts the Embeddable into an ObjectID by design, rather than a StringID....recall, the fix to OJ1501 was to strip white space from the end of a user's String key when that String was placed into a StringID.  So, the strings in an Embeddable would also need to be stripped, just as was done in OJ-1501, but unfortunately it would seem to be harder to do so for Embeddables since openJPA code doesn't necessarily know what types are contained in the Embed.
I've created a JUnit test case which has three test methods.  The test is attached here.
