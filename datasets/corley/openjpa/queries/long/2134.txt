Currently, during the prepareForPooling processing, we are closing the Connection before allowing the EM to be put placed into a Container's EM Pool.  That seems to be overkill, especially if the ConnectionRetainMode is set to "always".  We'll use this Issue to at least improve this processing when ConnectionRetainMode is set to "always".  But, this whole prepareForPooling might be unnecessary overhead.  Only correcting one issue at a time...
