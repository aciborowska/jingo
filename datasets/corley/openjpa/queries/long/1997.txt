I have a field :

	@Column(nullable = false, columnDefinition = "mediumblob")
	private byte[] data;

The generated sql comes out to be : "data BLOB NOT NULL"
The expectation was : "data mediumblob NOT NULL"

this seems like something that came up before in OPENJPA-740 and OPENJPA-224 , 224 even says it's fixed in 2.1.0 but does not appear to be so.
