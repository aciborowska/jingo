Does someone recently rewrite the critical method pcIsDetached() in PCEnhancer and broke it?

This is a piece of code in  isDetached(Object obj)  method of BrokerImpl
       PersistenceCapable pc = ...;
        Boolean detached = pc.pcIsDetached();
        if (detached != null)
            return detached.booleanValue();


A enhanced PersistenceCapable has the following in its pcIsDetached()
public Boolean pcIsDetached()
    {
        if(pcStateManager != null)
            if(pcStateManager.isDetached())
                return Boolean.TRUE;
            else
                return Boolean.FALSE;
        if(pcGetDetachedState() != null && pcGetDetachedState() != PersistenceCapable.DESERIALIZED)
            return Boolean.TRUE;
        if(version != 0)
            return Boolean.TRUE;
        if(pcVersionInit)
        
{
            return Boolean.TRUE;
        }
 else
        {
            return Boolean.FALSE;
        }
    }


The method never returns null. But that is what BrokerImpl checks for.
