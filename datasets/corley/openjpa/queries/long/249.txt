Situation description:
@Entity
public class Application 
{
...
	@ManyToOne(optional = false)
	@JoinColumn(name = "C_APPLICATION_STATUS",
		nullable = false)
	private ApplicationStatus applicationStatus;
...}

@Entity
public class ApplicationStatus {
	public static enum Code 
{
		created
	}
	@Id
	@Column(name = "C_CODE")
	@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
	private Code code;
}
And now the problem:
When executing query "SELECT a FROM Application a WHERE a.applicationStatus = :status" with parameter q.setParameter("status", ApplicationStatus status); everything works fine. 
But when trying to call the query like "SELECT a FROM Application a WHERE a.applicationStatus.code = package.ApplicationStatus.Code.created " it fails with: Attempt to query field "package.ApplicationStatus.Code.waiting" from non-entity class "null".
Is there any way to create a query with built in enum value? I found a similar issue on http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=506389&tstart=45
