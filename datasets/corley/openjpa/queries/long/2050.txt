According to the documentation for the Reverse Mapping Tool (Part 3, chapter 7, paragraph 2.1) a table can be declared as collection table. However, this functionality is obviously not implemented. According to the source code of org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.meta.PropertiesReverseCustomizer (versions 2.1.0 and 2.1.1) the value "collection" is not a valid one for the table type and leads to an IllegalArgumentException.
