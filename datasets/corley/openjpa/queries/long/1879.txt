A user reported a problem[1] where getting the id of an Entity that was enhanced using the eclipse tooling didn't work. I did some research and incorrect bytecode is the reason for the problem.

I'll upload two decompiled entities to show the problem with the byte code. I'm not sure if this problem can be resolved by just updating the version of OpenJPA that is packaged with the tooling, or if something else is needed
