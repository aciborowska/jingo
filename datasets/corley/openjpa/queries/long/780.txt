I am currently reviewing code, and this one piece of code stood out.  It might not be a bad thing, but it just has a "funny smell".  This is in DistributedStoreManager.  There it gets a String[], which it then iterates over it to find an appropriate slice.  But it looks like it either finds a slice and returns it, or finds a null and throws an exception, all on the first step of the for loop.  So really, there is no for loop at all.  This might be on purpose, but the code is just not as legible..


ORIGINAL
    /**

	Selects child StoreManager(s) where the given instance resides.
     */
    private StoreManager selectStore(OpenJPAStateManager sm, Object edata) 
Unknown macro: {        String[] targets = findSliceNames(sm, edata);        for (String target } 




expecting more like:

String[] targets = ....
if ( targets == null || targets.length == 0 ) {
    return null;
}
SliceStoreManager slice = lookup(targets[0]);
if (slice == null) {
    throw new InternalException(_loc.get("wrong-slice", target, sm));
}
return slice;
