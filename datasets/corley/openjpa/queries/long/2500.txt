I have an Enterprise Java Bean (EJB) called "A" and method called loadData with EJB "A". 

loadData method is marked with Supports Transaction attribute. 

loadData method tries to load Employee Data from JPA domain and further lazy fetches Department data and Employee Address Details. 

The response has only Employee Data and does not have Department data and Employee Address Details. 

If I change EJB method "A" Transaction attribute to Required then all details appear in the response. 

Why is Transaction attribute Supports causing JPA lazy fetching fails?
