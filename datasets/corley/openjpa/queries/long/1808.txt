Hi,
    I wrote a jpa 2.0 test case.
    In the entity class Course.java:
    @ElementCollection
    @CollectionTable(name="COURSE_COMMENTS")
    private List<Evaluation> evaluation;

    Here member "evaluation" contains comments of the course in another Table:COURSE_COMMENT

    I run it on Geronimo 3.0 server(Geronimo server uses openjpa to provide its jpa service), howver, inserting record into the Table "COURSE" is NOT sucessful.

    The server gives warning such like this:
  WARN   [DefaultThreadPool 198] openjpa.MetaData - Meta class
  "org.apache.geronimo.javaee6.jpa20.entities.Course_" for entity class org.apach
 e.geronimo.javaee6.jpa20.entities.Course can not be registered with following ex
 ception "java.security.PrivilegedActionException: java.lang.ClassNotFoundExcepti
  on: org.apache.geronimo.javaee6.jpa20.entities.Course_"

   Also can Not find meta class Evaluation_

   I'm not sure whether it is a problem created by OpenJPA?

    Could anyone help to have a look at it?
    Thanks in advance!

PS: I attached the code in the attachment.
