This happens when using OpenJPA as persistence provider for the EasyBeans ObjectWeb container.
The error is happening with "exploded" archive.
Exploded means that there is a directory, named "entitybean.jar" with a folder META-INF which contains a file named persistence.xml, and other directories/files for the classes.

It seems that when using this mode, OpenJPA is trying to parse the directory inputstream (which is failing).
This exception is not occuring if a jar file is used instead of the "exploded" mode, but the exploded mode is the default mode for EasyBeans.
Note also that this exception don't occur by using Hibernate Entity Manager or Oracle TopLink Essentials as persistence provider.

I will attach to this issue a stack trace (with the exploded directory) which fails and at the end with a jar file (which work)
