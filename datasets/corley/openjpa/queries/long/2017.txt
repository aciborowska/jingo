Batch loading data is a common use case. Often, the user would not refer to the managed instances after the loading session. However, the runtime, by default, spends time in detaching the managed instances by creating/removing proxy or retaining state as per the configured options.

An option should be provided to bypass these operations per persistence context basis.

AutoDetach.NONE could be a possibility. This option will be exclusive i.e. it can not be specified with any other AutoDetach options. The NONE option will bypass proxying the fields at the transaction boundary or close.
