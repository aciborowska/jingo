Now that we have determined that closing Connections was overkill during the prepareForPooling processing when ConnectionRetainMode is set to "always" (OPENJPA-2134), maybe it's time to kill the whole idea of prepareForPooling.  If application servers are doing their job correctly, all that should be necessary is to call clear() on the EntityManager before pooling an EM.  Instead of removing this public API immediately, I'm thinking we should mark it as deprecated (just in case any app servers are still dependent on this processing).
