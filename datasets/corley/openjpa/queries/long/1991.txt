The current implementation of SQLServerDictionary in OpenJPA only supports pagination based on TOP (offset+limit), which fetches more rows than necessary and thus degrades performance in comparison to DBMSes that support both limit and offset specification, like MySQL.

SQL Server 2005 supports a ROW_NUMBER function that can be used to restrict the result list to the necessary slice, taking both limit and offset into account. I would like OpenJPA to support this syntax.
