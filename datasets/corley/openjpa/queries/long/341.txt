Attached is a sample eclipse maven project. In this sample project, if you issue a mvn package, the OpenJPA enhance goal will exit with a  non-null exit code. 

If you were to delete the brazos.voter.lib.dao.Test.java class the code compiles just fine with the OpenJPA enhance goal. You will notice that Test.java is POJO with nothing in it.
