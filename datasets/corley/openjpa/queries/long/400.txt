I have a number of entities that were generated from a connection using a non-default schema.  I am trying to specify the default schema to use for all of my entities (these entities are Java-annotated classes).

In my orm.xml I specified:
     <persistence-unit-metadata>
		<persistence-unit-defaults>
			<schema>ADMINISTRATOR</schema>
		</persistence-unit-defaults>
	</persistence-unit-metadata>

As per the spec, it seems that all of my entities should use this defined schema, unless they override it.  However, this does not seem to have any effect and at runtime, queries are generated that are still trying to use the default schema (the username).  

If I instead use the openjpa property to set the schema in my persistence.xml:
		<properties>
			<property name="openjpa.jdbc.Schema" value="ADMINISTRATOR"/>					
		</properties>

This works fine.  But it is not very portable, which is why I was trying to do this in the orm.xml.
