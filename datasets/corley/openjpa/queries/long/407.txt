When data is not available in the data cache, OpenJPA dynamically creates SQL to look up the requested data. OpenJPA should more aggressively cache this SQL to accelerate pathways from a cache miss to the database.

The generated SQL takes a number of factors into account, including the requested records, transaction status, currently-loaded data, and the current fetch configuration. Any caching would need to account for these factors as well.
