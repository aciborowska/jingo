in DB-queries the catalog name is never used, like in "select * from mycatalog..MyTable where ..."
This is unfortunate with Sybase (where catalogs are heavily used), because it forces one to have multiple persistence units, one for each catalog.
And when I want a relation to an entity mapped to a table in a different catalog, I get an SQL-exception, since the 2nd table cannot be found (in the same catalog).
This could be solved by prepending the catalog to the table name.
