The remaining work for support bulk updates that needed to be evaluated in memory.
Math operation (+, -, *, /, mod) and most of the functions returning Strings are resolved in OPENJPA-612.

The in memory update support  is not complete until all new_value that can be expressed in JPQL are supported.

Those new_value that we still need the support are:
     math_expression :   SQRT, ABS, SIZE
     datetime functions
     boolean value
     enum value
     NULL
     simple_entity_expression
