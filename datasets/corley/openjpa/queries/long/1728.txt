Discovered while working on OPENJPA-1724 that the SchemaTool is generating XML files marked as encoding="UTF-8", but the code is actually using a FileWriter which uses the JVM locale instead of a OutputStreamWriter set to UTF-8 for the output.

This is not a simple switch of class usage, as the SchemaTool supports an APPEND flag, which FileWriter supports, but OutputStreamWriter does not....
