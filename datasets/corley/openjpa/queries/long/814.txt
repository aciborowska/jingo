I just found some code that says it's there only to support jdk 1.3.1, but I assume that is not supported any longer.


JDBCConfigurationImpl

        // this static initializer is to get past a weird
        // ClassCircularityError that happens only under IBM's
        // JDK 1.3.1 on Linux from within the JRun ClassLoader;
        // while exact causes are unknown, it is almost certainly
        // a bug in JRun, and we can get around it by forcing
        // Instruction.class to be loaded and initialized
        // before TypedInstruction.class
        try 
{ serp.bytecode.lowlevel.Entry.class.getName(); }
 
        catch (Throwable t) {}
        try 
{ serp.bytecode.Instruction.class.getName(); }
 
        catch (Throwable t) {}
