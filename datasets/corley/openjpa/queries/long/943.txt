Hi,


      I am using two managed servers in a cluster in same machine.For Cache synchronization across multiple JVM  I tried to use the following settings in persistance.xml.

  <property name="kodo.RemoteCommitProvider" value="tcp(Addresses=192.168.39.23)">

But when i deploy this application into cluster in one of the manged server i am getting a socket connection error.I think it is because of the two manged server in cluster is in same mechine.Both server trying to listen on the same default port. I could able to make it work when i used two managers in to different machine.But from the documentation i can not figure out how i can configure TCP option for remote commit provider in the case of same machine with multiple jvm. I also tried with 

    <property name="kodo.RemoteCommitProvider" value="wls-cluster"/>

 this also work fine when they are in two different machine but not working when they are in same machine.


 I could not figure out the remote commit provider for multiple jvm and same machine.

can anyone please help me.....

thanks and regards
