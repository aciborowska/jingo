The following info message is logged repeatedly by default (INFO log level) 

 2532162  **** INFO  openjpa.Runtime - Though you are using optimistic transactions, OpenJPA is now beginning a datastore transaction because you have 
requested a lock on some data.

Should turn this message into a TRACE entry and only log when need/request.

Also, the manual has documented the incorrect log levels supported by OpenJPA:


	DefaultLevel: The default logging level of unconfigured channels. Recognized values are  TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR. Defaults to INFO.



DEBUG is deprecated and FATAL level is missing.
