The current distribution policy requires that target slice be determinable when the managed instance instance enters the persistence context. However, if the target slice for an instance X is determined by some attribute of Y which is referred by X â€“ then at the time of invocation the target slice for X may not be determinable. This improvement will allow the policy to return null, so that the target slice can be determined when the instance is being flushed to the datastore.
