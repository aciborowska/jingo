The QueryByExample feature of the OpenJPAQueryBuilder implementation is not documented in our manual.  There is some documentation in our javadocs for the qbe method, but nothing in the docs to further explain or show examples.  Pinaki's article on the Criteria API [1] talks about this feature.  And, I'm reviewing another external publication (that will be coming out soon) that also describes this feature.  So, it won't be too long before we get questions on how this feature is supposed to be used.
