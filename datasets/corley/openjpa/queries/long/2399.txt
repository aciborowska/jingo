I recently had to upgrade to JDK 1.7 and I'm having
java.lang.LinkageError: loader (instance of  sun/misc/Launcher$AppClassLoader): attempted  duplicate class definition for name: "org/apache/openjpa/jdbc/identifier/DBIdentifier$DBIdentifierType"

I previously reported this sometime ago here:
http://openjpa.208410.n2.nabble.com/JDK-1-7-seems-to-be-causing-an-issue-with-latest-snapshot-td7581417.html#a7583248

seems there has been no resolution. I've tried 2.2.0, 2.2.1 and 2.3.0-SNAPSHOT and all have same issue on Oracle JDK 1.7. Can someone please advise?
