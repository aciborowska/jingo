When application configures other persistence provider rather than openjpa, there will be a warning message printed out:
WARNING: Found unrecognized persistence provider "org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider" in place of OpenJPA provider.  This provider's properties will not be used.

It is legal that other persistence provider be configured. The message doesn't look friendly and might be confusing.

I change the message like:
INFO: Found persistence provider "org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider". OpenJPA will not be used.
