Provide a way to enable query cache as a query hint.

This would facilitate writing portable JPA applications.

For the time being, with OpenJPA, we need to execute the following code to cache the query :


OpenJPAEntityManager oem = ((OpenJPAQuery<?>) query).getEntityManager();
OpenJPAEntityManagerFactory oemf = oem.getEntityManagerFactory();
QueryResultCache qcache = oemf.getQueryResultCache();
qcache.pin(query);



It would be easier if JPA provided a query hint like :


query.setHint("openjpa.cacheable", cache);



This would even enable us to use it in a NamedQuery declaration :



@NamedQuery(name = "Civilite.findAll",
    query = "SELECT c FROM Civilite c", 
    hints = @QueryHint(name = "openjpa.cacheable", value = "true"))
