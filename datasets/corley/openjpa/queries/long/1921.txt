When changing my orm.xml file to have access="PROPERTY" instead of access="FIELD", my JUnit test fails with an EntityExistsException.

Id of my entities are not generated, but set manually.

I join 2 zip files of the Eclipse test project (1 for the entities, 1 for the test under OpenEjb), and the stdout file with the error.
