A growing body of developers are using OpenJPA and reporting their use case scenarios, error report via the Nabble posts. This process generates wealth of unstructured information.

  Here is a proposal to add some more structure to it:

1. We publish and distribute the common utilities of OpenJPA's JUnit based test harness.
2. We request/mandate that submission of a JIRA report accompany a test case written in accordance to OpenJPA-JUnit based tests.

This way, we can build a diverse test corpus gradually.

To get this done, we need to
1. Document our JUnit Test harness related classes (such as SingleEMFTestCase etc.). They already are well-documented â€“ perhaps a small write-up on 'How to write OpenJPA test' manual.
2. Extend our build so that these tests classes are distributed with their source code in a separate bundle.  
3. Promote the users' to contribute their test cases
