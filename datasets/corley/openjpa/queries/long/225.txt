openjpa.ClassTransformerOptions is a valid option in persistence.xml and PersistenceProviderImpl looks for it and uses it to configure the class transformer (lines 94-95), but if you use it you get a complaint like

08:43:22,636 WARN  [Runtime] The property named "openjpa.ClassTransformerOptions" was not recognized and will be ignored, although the name closely matches a valid property called "openjpa.ClassResolver".

According to Patrick the best fix is to make the ConfigurationProvider aware of this option so it doesn't complain.
