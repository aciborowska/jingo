I have the following code:
@SequenceGenerator(name="CompanySeqGen", sequenceName="COMPANYSEQUENCE")
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator="CompanySeqGen")

and following property in persistence.xml file:
<property name="openjpa.jdbc.SynchronizeMappings" value="buildSchema(SchemaAction='drop,add,deleteTableContents',IgnoreErrors=true)" />

When I generate the schema for the first time everything is OK. However when I do it once again I get exception that sequence 'COMPANYSEQUENCE' already exists. I have to remove this sequence manually using SQL language.

Tables are dropped and then created, but sequences are not removed.

Similar problem has already been reported but with different database.
