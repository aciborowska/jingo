At the moment the information is split across several sources:


	http://openjpa.apache.org/release-management.html (which looks like a good entry point)
	http://openjpa.apache.org/apache-nexus-release-process-(1.2.x-2.1.x).html (for Nexus-based releases, which is where the current releases are managed)
	https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openjpa/trunk/openjpa-project/RELEASE_STEPS.adoc



It seems that the simpler solution is to remove the last document and to use its content to upgrade the second.

Moreover, the first document (and the ones linked from it) should also be reviewed.
