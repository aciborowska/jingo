Hi,

During a class on JPA we have noticed a bug occurring when using the
"TABLE PER CLASS" inheritance strategy.

The test case involves three classes: Computer, Desktop and Gamer. Gamer
extends Desktop that extends Computer.

I have a desktop and a gamer computer in the database. For the JPQL
request "SELECT g FROM Gamer g" the system returns 2 computers but the
correct answer should be 1 (since Gamer is more specific than Destop).

The correct answer is provided for SINGLE_TABLE and JOINED strategies.

I attached the source code with the unit tests. It is a drive link
because I can't uploaded compressed files:

Thanks for your help.
Thibault.
