Dear OpenJPA Team,

We have created a JPQL query for finding all (newest) "GuidedMaintenance" entity who contains at least one "MaintenanceModule" entity from a MaintenanceModule list parameter :
=========================
SELECT M FROM GUIDEDMAINTENANCE AS M WHERE (M.previous IS NULL AND M.next IS NULL) OR (M.previous IS NOT NULL AND M.next IS NULL) AND M.modules IN (?1)

The Java query snippet :
=========================
TypedQuery<GuidedMaintenance> query = em.createNamedQuery("guidedmaintenance.contains.module", GuidedMaintenance.class);
query.setParameter(1, Arrays.asList(modules));	// ModuleMaintenance[] modules, white one entity

We obtains this SQL exception :
=========================
Caused by: org.apache.openjpa.lib.jdbc.ReportingSQLException: Syntax error: Encountered "NULL" at line 1, column 1369.

AND (t5.DTYPE IS NULL OR t5.DTYPE IN (?)) AND (t6.DTYPE IS NULL OR t6.DTYPE IN (?))}
 [code=30000, state=42X01]

I think it's a bug because our modules list isn't empty and we obtains SQL statement "t1.MODULES_ID IN (NULL)".
