Everry time that openjpa-maven-plugin is run, it shows the following warning:

[INFO] — openjpa-maven-plugin:2.2.0-SNAPSHOT:sql (default-cli) @
syncope-core —
Downloading:
file://${basedir}/internal-repository/org/apache/openjpa/openjpa-lib/2.2.0-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml
[WARNING] Could not transfer metadata
org.apache.openjpa:openjpa-lib:2.2.0-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml from/to
openjpa-internal (file://${basedir}/internal-repository): Repository
path /internal-repository does not exist, and cannot be created.

I've found that this is happening because of an internal-only repository declared in openjpa-kernel's POM.

In the attached patch I just overwrite such repository declaration: I guess there could be a more elegant way to achieve this, anyway...
