If there is an instance of the other side of a OneToMany bidirectional relation in the data cache, and it was not fetched with the bidirectional relationship set (i.e., turned off in a fetch group), the inverse relation will remain null even when the "One" side is fetched normally.

I believe this is what I was seeing here:
