It would be nice if Eclipse project metadata files were added to svn ignore in OpenJPA subversion repository. These files can be generated by maven (by running "mvn eclipse:eclipse"), but then show up as local additions in svn diff and Eclipse UI. No big deal, but makes preparing OpenJPA patches a little bit more difficult than it has to be. Thank you in advance.
