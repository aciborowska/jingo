We keep seeing intermittent failures in some of the datacache tests (mainly TestSJVMCache on DB2) due to how CacheTest uses hardcoded Thread.sleep() calls to try and time when the entities have been removed from the cache.  Instead, I'm going to include some code to determine time elapsed, to make a better determination on how long to sleep.  Also, will add some code to skip some of the cache checks when we've already passed the timeout value for the next entity, as sometimes the load on our DB2 machine affects these test runs (and the first couple of cacheCheck() calls almost always fail when running against a remote db server.)
