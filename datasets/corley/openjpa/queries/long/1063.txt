I've noticed several threads on the users list where we keep getting questions about the runtime dependencies needed for OpenJPA and would like to use this JIRA to:

1) rename the current trunk/openjpa-all directory to trunk/openjpa to properly match the OpenJPA aggregate artifact name of openjpa-${version}.jar used today.

2) create a new /trunk/openjpa-all/pom.xml which creates a OpenJPA + depends aggregate artifact openjpa-all-${version}.jar, which users can grab if they want all of the runtime dependencies (OpenJPA, Commons, Geronimo Specs and Serp).  This would not include any Derby, ANT, Postgresql or IBM dependencies.
