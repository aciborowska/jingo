Patch for issue OPENJPA-2233 introduced a message when a Embeddable entity defines an ID property, which the Enhancer can't properly add a helper method (getIDOwningClass).

The problem is that this message is also emitted when inheriting from a MappedSuperClass, containing an Id field/property, which is a very common pattern. 

As the persistence engine of OpenJPA works perfectly with such a class hierarchy (and even the Enhancer with the complement of that patch just skips adding a call to the non-added helper method), it is pointless to alarm operations personnel with a message labeled and tagged as an error.

Therefore I suggest to log it as a warning, also editing the corresponding message text to better indicate that the Enhancer will simply not add/call the helper method, skipping a potential optimization.
