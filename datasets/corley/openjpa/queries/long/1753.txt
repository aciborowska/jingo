This test case spawns three threads and the pass/no pass of the test cases depends on the timing. 

	One example is TestMixedLockManagerFindPermutation.testFindReadPessimisticRead: 
        commonFindTest(
            "testFind(Read,Commit/PessimisticRead,Rollback)",
            LockModeType.READ, Act.CommitTx, 1, null,
            LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_READ, Act.RollbackTx, 1, null);

	If the find by the second child [Thread-8] is executed before the jdbc commit of the update statement by the first child [Thread-7], the test will fail. Attached are the trace file for the successful run and failing run.
