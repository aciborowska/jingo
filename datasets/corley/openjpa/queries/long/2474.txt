since events such as @PostUpdate only receives the object itself, it's hard to do something more useful than just logging when the change occurred. A more useful feature would be to retrieve the changes from some context object like itÂ´s done for example with this http://docs.doctrine-project.org/en/2.0.x/reference/events.html#preupdate - see the "PreUpdateEventArgs" concept.

@Auditable maybe?
