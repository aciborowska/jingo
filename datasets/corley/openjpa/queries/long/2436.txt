When DynamicEnhancementAgent is set to true in a persistence.xml with multiple persistence unit definitions, the PCEnhancerAgent will loop through each PU and attempt an initiateAll().  However, if there is an error in the RemoteCommitProvider (such as an unreachable address), the initiate fails and persistence does not start.

It makes no difference whether the pu that causes the exception was the one to be used or not.  

Setting the DynamicEnhancementAgent to false solves the problem.

Rick Curtis advised:
"In the event that an invalid PU is encountered, a message should be logged and the error should be tolerated."
