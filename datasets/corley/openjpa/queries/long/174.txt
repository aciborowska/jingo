class B extends A
A is abstract
B is concrete

i have persisted an instance of B. now i try:

A a = em.find(A.class, anId);

openjpa fails with:

... Cannot create new application identity instance for abstract   class "class A"

if i change the find to:

A a = em.find(B.class, anId);

openjpa works okay.

note that i have two test cases. one is my real model, and one is the simple A and B class example above. my real model fails, where the simple A, B class example works as expected. so, it's is either a side affect of some other issue, or there is something wrong in my model and the error message is misleading or lacking information.
