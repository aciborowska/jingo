In JPA2, additional reserved words are introduced in the JPQL language. For example,  KEY, VALUE, ENTRY, CASE, etc.
These keywords is causing existing application that migrate to JPA2 regressed in ArgumentException (JPQL parser error).
For example,

     JPQL:  select c from Customer c where c.name = :value

:value is a named parameter, but 'value' is a reserved word in JPA2.

The above query used to work in OpenJPA-1.2.x but not in OpenJPA-2.x
