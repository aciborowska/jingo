If an embeddable has the same persistent field names as its owning class, or two embeddables contains the same field names and both are embedded in an entity class, openjpa will not work properly due to the column name clashes. The fix is for openjpa to detect these situations and throw an exception and for the application to use @AttributeOverride to specify unique column names for the persistent fields in the embeddable.
