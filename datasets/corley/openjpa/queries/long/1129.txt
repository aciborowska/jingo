When I create a namedQuery, I see the following message logged.

110641  WARN   [Thread-2] openjpa.Runtime - "openjpa.FetchPlan.ReadLockMode" is not a supported query hint. May be you meant "openjpa.FetchPlan.ReadLockLevel"? 

To recreate the problem, create an Entity with a named query and then try to create that named query via EntityManager.createNamedQuery(..). It doesn't seem to have any functional affect, but I don't think it should be logged.
