This is follow-on work to OPENJPA-857. OpenJPA will now detect the version in the persistence.xml for a PU and set it in the configuration.  This will result in the appropriate state of various compatibility options to be set based upon the JPA level, allowing OpenJPA 1.0 applications to function without modifications.  In addition, integrated bean validation will be disabled for 1.0 applications.  Otherwise, unexpected validation could occur by default within a 1.0 app if there is a validation provider in the environment.
