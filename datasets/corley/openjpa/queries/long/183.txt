OpenJPAEntityManager.setLargeTransaction() and OpenJPAEntityManager.setPopulateDataCache() control how a given transaction uses the data cache. These APIs (and in particular, setLargeTransaction()) would benefit from being per-class (or per-class-hierarchy) instead of being global to all classes in a transaction.
