When working on OPENJPA-1469 I found that the test org.apache.openjpa.persistence.spring.TestLibService fails because we have stale data in the cache.  To recreate this failure, set "openjpa.DataCache","true" in the setup() method.

The net of the problem is that if the non-owning side of the relationship exists in the datacache and the relationship is updated on the owning side, the non-owning side doesn't get updated.
