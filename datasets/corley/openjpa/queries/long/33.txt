From the discussions on the dev mailling list, each organization involved with OpenJPA has their own "proprietary" test bucket for testing the JPA query capabilities.  At some point, one of these organizations will have to do the necessary work to contribute or at least start the OpenJPA query test bucket.  Without a common set of tests, none of us will know whether committing changes that affect the query engine will be acceptable to all parties.  Also, by starting this test bucket, we will have a framework to work within.

I'm writing this JIRA report so that we know that this is an issue that needs to be addressed.  And, once one of these organizations (or individuals) find the time to make their test bucket submittable, they can assign the report to themselves so that we don't duplicate effort.  This is not saying that we can't have multiple flavors of test buckets, but at least we will know if somebody is working on one.

Thanks,
