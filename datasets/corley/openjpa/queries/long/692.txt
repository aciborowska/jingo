If
a) Entities A and B that are related in a one-to-many and many-to-one bi-directional relation (typical Parent-Child pattern)
b) mapped using a JoinTable instead of conventional mappedBy 

then
update/delete operation fails with OptimisticException (which itself is a catch-all and sometimes misleading). 


Typical mapping that encounters this error:

public class Person {
	@Id
	private long ssn;

	@OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
	@JoinTable(name="J_PERSON_ADDRESSES",
			joinColumns               = @JoinColumn(name="PERSON_SSN",    referencedColumnName="SSN"),
			inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name="ADDRESS_PHONE", referencedColumnName="PHONE"))
    private Set<Address> addresses = new HashSet<Address>();

public class Address {
   @Id
   private String phone;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(table="J_PERSON_ADDRESSES", referencedColumnName="SSN")
    private Person person;
