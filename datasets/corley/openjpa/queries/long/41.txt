I've tried several versions of OpenJPA including the most recent one(svn 4409856) to run Spring's Petclinic with class level LoadTimeWeaver on OpenJPA.
I have attached the stacktrace that I get. The same example works fine with Toplink.

I have attached petclinic w/o some of the libs to gain space; basically add the OpenJPA libs and deploy the war into Tomcat. Note that you'll also have to place spring-tomcat-weaver.jar under Tomcat's server/lib (this should be enough - if you have problems let me know or take a look at the Spring reference documentation).
When the webapp starts, the exception pops up.
