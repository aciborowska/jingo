I'm getting a build error when trying to build the openjpa docbook 

[WARNING] The POM for org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:jar:1.0.0 is missing, no dependency information available
[WARNING] Failed to retrieve plugin descriptor for org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:1.0.0: Plugin org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:1.0.0 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved: Failed to read artifact descriptor for org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:jar:1.0.0
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD FAILURE


$> mvn versions:show-plugin-updates
shows that the docbook plugin is pretty outdated. 

[INFO] The following plugin updates are available:
[INFO]   com.agilejava.docbkx:docbkx-maven-plugin ............ 2.0.7 -> 2.0.13

We should try to update to the latest bugfix version.
