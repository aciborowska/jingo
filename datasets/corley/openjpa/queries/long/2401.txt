Hi, unless I set "@OneToMany" as shown here:
https://github.com/gmazza/blog-samples/blob/master/jpa_and_junit/src/main/java/entities/Department.java#L47

I'll get this warning message:
678  CompanyPU  WARN   [main] openjpa.Runtime - Fields "employees" are not a default persistent type, and do not have any annotations indicating their persistence strategy. They will be treated as non-persistent. If you intended for these fields to be persistent, be sure to annotate them appropriately. Otherwise annotate them with @Transient.

However, I shouldn't have to set that annotation because I've already declared one-to-many via XML configuration:
