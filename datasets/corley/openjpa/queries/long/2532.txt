OpenJPA does not restore the autocommit property to it's original state before closing a connection, nor does it roll back or commit in-flight transactions.

In JDBCStoreManager.begin() OpenJPA sets autocommit to true, but when closing the connection later in close() it simply delegates to Connection.close().

This can create a problem with connection pools that do not automatically restore these settings when connections are returned, but instead rely on the client to clean up, for example tomcat-pool.
