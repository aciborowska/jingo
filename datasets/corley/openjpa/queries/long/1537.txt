If you ask the SchemaGenerator to generate schemas like this:

sg.generateSchemas(new DBIdentifier[] 
{ DBIdentifier.newTable("informix.foobar_table") }
);

...then identifiers within the SchemaGenerator-whether of tables, primary keys, foreign keys, what have you-contain quotes.

Quoted identifiers are then subsequently not trimmed, because the space padding occurs inside the quotes.

This means the SchemaGroup will, for example, never find the Schema identified by the user at generateSchemas()-call-time.  Consequently no foreign keys will be generated.
