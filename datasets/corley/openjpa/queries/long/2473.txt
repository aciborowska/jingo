is executed by the following code

TypedQuery<Object[]> query = getEntityManager().createNamedQuery(Dcard.FIND_BASE_CARD_BY_DEPOSIT, Object[].class);
        query.setParameter(D_MAJOR_ID, depositKey.getMajorId());
        query.setParameter(D_MINOR_ID, depositKey.getMinorId());

        query.setParameter("nulldate", new Date(0), TemporalType.DATE);
        List<Object[]> list = query.getResultList();
