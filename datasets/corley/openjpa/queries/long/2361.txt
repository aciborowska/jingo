We have noticed during the database upgrade by OpenJPA that an annotated field with @Column(unique=true) in our previous DB model  - annotated now @Column(unique=false) - doesn't remove the old unique constraint. There is the same behaviour with @Column(nullable=true/false).

Current workaround: we drop the constraint with a native SQL request.

Attached please find two bundled unitary testsuites that reproduce the problem.
