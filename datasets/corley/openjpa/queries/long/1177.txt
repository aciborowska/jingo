We need to upgrade from CR2 level of the API (geronimo-validation_1.0_spec-1.0-EA2-SNAPSHOT) to the ust released  CR3 level (geronimo-validation_1.0_spec-1.0-EA3-SNAPSHOT).

Moving from the Validation 1.0.CR2 to 1.0.CR3 levels are going to cause us some churn:

	The 4 descriptor class were moved into a javax.validation.metadata package.
	A new javax.validation.Path was introduced for iterable nodes, which replaces some String usage in ConstraintViolation and TraversableResolver.



Note: Either the agimatec-validation code will need to be updated or we'll have to switch to using the RI for testing.
