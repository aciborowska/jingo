If I do:


@Externalizer("com.factory.SuperJsonSerializer.toStringFromSuperObject")
@Factory("com.factory.SuperJsonSerializer.fromStringToSuperObject")
@Column(name="test")
private SuperObject object;



Then we can identify introspecting externalizer/factory that the column type is actually String and not SuperObject. It then means we can switch the type of the object to String and avoid java serialization which will keep the database "clean"

side note: this is sthg to keep in mind for JPA 2.1 converters as well
