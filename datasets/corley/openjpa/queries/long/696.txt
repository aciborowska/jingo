Discussed in OpenJPA forum first:  http://n2.nabble.com/TransactionSynchronizationRegistry-reference-cached-permanently-td727197.html#a727197

This Issue is requesting that we cache the reference for the TransactionSynchronizationRegistry in the EMF instead of per JVM.  This would be similar to what we did with the TransactionManager in the past.  Reference the forum postings for background and justification on the request.
