Test.test1() does a merge() on a new object with a @GeneratedValue id. Here OpenJPA sends this query to the database:


SELECT t0.name FROM Country t0 WHERE t0.id = ? [params=(long) 0]



Presumably to check whether the entity is already present in the database, but this is unnecessary because it's a new object without an id (id == null). 

Workaround for this bug is to use persist() in stead of merge(). But this is not always possible, for example when using an object which is not known by the EntityManager. This is Test.test2(), where OpenJPA sends the query:


SELECT t1.id, t1.name, t0.name FROM Citizen t0 LEFT OUTER JOIN Country t1 ON t0.countryId = t1.id WHERE t0.id = ? [params=(long) 0]
