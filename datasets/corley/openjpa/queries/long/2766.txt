Support modular organization of entities so that all entities do not need to be contained in the same jar, or referenced in a single persistence.xml <class> listing.

Use cases:
1. Jar A contains entityA, Jar B contains entityB.  (EntityB may or may not extend from entityA.)
2. Jar X contains persistence.xml defining the PU
3. Jar C contains entityC and a list of classes that extend entityA. Jar X persistence unit should be able to persist entityC and its collection of entityA, entityB.. etc

Features:
1. Auto-classpath scanning (perhaps for persistence-fragment.xml.. then enumerate)
2. Support manual registration and unregistration of entity classes (not just class names) to support OSGi environments that have per-bundle classloaders and deploy/undeploy support.
