Hi, We have recently upgraded our infrastructure from WAS7.x to WAS8.x . Post migration in prod, we ended up with blow issue. 
Issue: The open JPA which is delivered as part of WAS 8.5.5.7, is altering our DB sequences with increment by value as 50. We tried to disable this sql with the below property in persistence.xml but for some reason, open jpa not considering this property and still sequence getting altered.

Below are the various ways we tried to disable the alter sequence sql, but none of these options worked for us
<property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" value="DisableAlterSeqenceIncrementBy=true"  />

<property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" value="disableAlterSeqenceIncrementBy=true"  />

<property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary.DisableAlterSeqenceIncrementBy" value="true"  />

<property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary.disableAlterSeqenceIncrementBy" value="true"  />
