JPA 2.0 spec draft version dated Oct 2008 had proposed a Criteria API. Let us call it CAPI08.
Current trunk version of OpenJPA has implemented this API. Let us call this CIMPL08.

In a recent version of JPA spec submitted to JCP, a new Criteria API has replaced the previous version. Let this be CAPI09
Given that OpenJPA has a functioning implementation of the earlier proposal â€“ we need to satisfy two objectives

1. Adopt CAPI09 which will be formalized shortly. This will requires us to update maven repository with source code for CAPI09. This will replace CAPI08. 
2. Migrate the existing implementation CIMPL08 to a refactored openjpa specific package.
