As reported while working on OPENJPA-878, we have an inconsistent usage of serialVersionUID in the 2.0.0 code.
There were 2 options discussed, but not decided upon, so the work is being split out of 878 into it's own JIRA.
1) Remove the new usage of serialVersionUID from classes added in 2.0.0.  The attached OPENJPA-878-serialVersionUID.patch handles this option.
2) Add missing serialVersionUID values for every class that Eclipse flags.  BUT, this lead to the discussion of should we use new values or try to use the ones generated for existing released jars (which then leads to which versions of the jars - 1.2.1?)
