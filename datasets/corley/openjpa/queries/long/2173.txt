final field are per definition transient, but when there are also JPA-Annotations which lead to an conflicting situation then there should be an error output.
At the moment, such fields are ignored at all, but in most cases it would be a programming error and it would be nice to become an hint from the framework.

Example:

@OneToMany
final Set aa = new HashSet();

I think the behavior should be like in

@JoinColumn
@OneToMany(mappedBy="bb")

In this Situation the conflict ist not ignored. There is an error output.
