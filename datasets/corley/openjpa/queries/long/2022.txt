When running either of the versions of the reversemappingtool as reported in the 1940 bug as fixed, i get the same error as in 2.1.0 :

[reversemappingtool] 2363  openjpa  INFO   [main] openjpa.Tool - ReverseMappingTool : generating classes.
[reversemappingtool] 2365  openjpa  INFO   [main] openjpa.MetaData - Table "RMTOOLS."AppUsers"" could not be reverse mapped.  This means that the table does not have a primary key (primary keys are required to establish unique identifiers for all persistent objects) and does not match a known pattern for a table used for cross-reference or value collections.

this happens for all my tables. Is it possible this bug was reintroduced?


thanks
