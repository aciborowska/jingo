Date objects persisted out and read back may not have exactly identical values due to differences in the implicit precision of Java date object versus the actual database. The results can be quite frustrating to developers who aren't aware of that fact.

I think it deserves to be a topic in the user's guide, along with mention of similar imprecise datatypes.
