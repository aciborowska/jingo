Per email to users@openjpa, an entity with this annotation :

@Column(columnDefinition=BINARY(250)) 
private byte[] blobs; 

creates a column of type BLOB when using MySQL.. This behavior was introduced in OPENJPA-740, which optimizes the blob storage based on the size of the column, but does not take into account any existing annotations.
