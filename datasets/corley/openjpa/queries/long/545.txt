From the thread on the dev mailing list when we were discussing whether to get rid of the JDK 1.4 requirement...

"If we do down this path, we should look at replacing (or enhancing) our UUID implementation with the UUID class that is now part of JDK 5 (http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/UUID.html).  I just heard from a user that the random number version of the UUID (version 4) provides for more efficient index processing.  This is part of the Java implementation.  We should take a look at that as an alternative."

Thus, this sub-task...
