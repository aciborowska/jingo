The patch for OPENJPA-2233 logs error message when embeddable entity has Id field. Because MappedSuperclass is set embedded only the message is shown if it contains an Id field. As far as I can see it doesn't break its behavior in any way.

Don't know if it's just the log condition incorrect or maybe the MappedSuperclass shouldn't be set embedded only in AnnotationPersistenceMetaDataParser lines [555,558]:
  // while the spec only provides for embedded exclusive, it doesn't
  // seem hard to support otherwise
  if (entity == null)
    meta.setEmbeddedOnly(true);
