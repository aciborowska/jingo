Hi, I'm on the Apache Roller team and we apparently have a dozen or so missing @Transient annotations somewhere within our many, many persistence classes but OpenJPA just tells us the element missing the annotation, not the entity class where that element is located[1].

For example, running mvn test from Roller's weblogger-business module:

575  RollerPU  WARN   [main] openjpa.Runtime - Fields "categories" are not a default persistent type, and do not have any annotations indicating their persistence strategy. They will be treated as non-persistent. If you intended for these fields to be persistent, be sure to annotate them appropriately. Otherwise annotate them with @Transient.
575  RollerPU  WARN   [main] openjpa.Runtime - Fields "entryAttributes" are not a default persistent type, and do not have any annotations indicating their persistence strategy. They will be treated as non-persistent. If you intended for these fields to be persistent, be sure to annotate them appropriately. Otherwise annotate them with @Transient.
575  RollerPU  WARN   [main] openjpa.Runtime - Fields "tags" are not a default persistent type, and do not have any annotations indicating their persistence strategy. They will be treated as non-persistent. If you intended for these fields to be persistent, be sure to annotate them appropriately. Otherwise annotate them with @Transient.
740  RollerPU  WARN   [main] openjpa.Runtime - Fields "inputStream" are not a default persistent type, and do not have any annotations indicating their persistence strategy. They will be treated as non-persistent. If you intended for these fields to be persistent, be sure to annotate them appropriately. Otherwise annotate them with @Transient.
740  RollerPU  WARN   [main] openjpa.Runtime - Fields "directory" are not a default persistent type, and do not have any annotations indicating their persistence strategy. They will be treated as non-persistent. If you intended for these fields to be persistent, be sure to annotate them appropriately. Otherwise annotate them with @Transient.
740  RollerPU  WARN   [main] openjpa.Runtime - Fields "tags" are not a default persistent type, and do not have any annotations indicating their persistence strategy. They will be treated as non-persistent. If you intended for these fields to be persistent, be sure to annotate them appropriately. Otherwise annotate them with @Transient.
781  RollerPU  WARN   [main] openjpa.Runtime - Fields "parent" are not a default persistent type, and do not have any annotations indicating their persistence strategy. They will be treated as non-persistent. If you intended for these fields to be persistent, be sure to annotate them appropriately. Otherwise annotate them with @Transient.

These fields are so generic they could be on any of a half-dozen entity classes.  If you could alter the error message to include the entity class where the field missing @Transient is located, it would be much easier for code cleanup/debugging.  Thanks!
