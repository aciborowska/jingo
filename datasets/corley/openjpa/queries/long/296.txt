From the dev list:


@Entity
public class Foo 
{

 @Id
 @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO, generator="uuid-string")
 private String id;

}

CREATE TABLE Foo (
 id VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL
}

If I do one em.persist() it works just fine. However, if I do a a whole
list of them, I get exceptions (duplicate). If I enable logging I can
see they are all using the same id during INSERT. I stepped a bit
through the code and noticed that uuid-string doesn't get generated
while em.persist(), but much later while committing/flushing. I then
looked a bit (just a bit) at the UUID generator code and noticed that
the bytes are not changing much (maybe only the first two), but again,
that was while debugging, so I'm assuming I have a supa-fast machine.
