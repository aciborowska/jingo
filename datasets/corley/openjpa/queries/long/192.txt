Phill Moran reported a problem with WASManagedRuntime and Spring. Attached is the relevant portion of the stack trace :

I don't believe this is the root of the problem that he's running into, but it needs to be cleaned up before we go further. 

The error occurs when we configure the WASManagedRuntime and one approach is to swallow the exception at that time and proceed. 

A better approach is to look for a "WebSphere signiture" in the constructor to WASManagedRuntime, if it's not found throw an exception. The exception is handled by AutomaticRuntime and prevents WASManagedRuntime from being used again (this is similar to what WLSManagedRuntime does).
