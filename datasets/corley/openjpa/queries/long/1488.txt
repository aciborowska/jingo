We have entities which are mapped to tables with equal names but different column definitions. Our mapping tool does not always correctly handle such case which might result in test failures. The occurence of failures depends on test execution sequence and database.

Such entities include RuntimeTest1 spread across different packages. There might be more of them. An example of stack trace can be seen at http://n2.nabble.com/DISCUSS-Time-for-an-OpenJPA-2-0-0-release-tp4417943p4445279.html
