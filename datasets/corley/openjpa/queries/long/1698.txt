Hi,

I want to set up my project during development so that all table contents are deleted with the following property in persistence.xml:
<property name="openjpa.jdbc.SynchronizeMappings" value="buildSchema(SchemaAction=add,SchemaAction=deleteTableContents)"/>

If I start up with an empty database I get the following error:
org.apache.openjpa.persistence.PersistenceException: ERROR: Relation >>openjpa_sequence_table<< doesn't exist.

This error is raised because of the following sql statement: DELETE FROM OPENJPA_SEQUENCE_TABLE.

My suggested solution would be to modify DBDictionary.getDeleteTableContentsSQL so that it only deletes content from a table if the table exists.

DBDictionary: Line 2183
---------------------------------
change: deleteSQL.add("DELETE FROM " + toDBName(tables[i].getFullIdentifier()));
to: deleteSQL.add("DELETE FROM " + toDBName(tables[i].getFullIdentifier()) + " IF EXISTS");

What do you mean: Is this a valid bugfix? I'm looking forward to your responses.
