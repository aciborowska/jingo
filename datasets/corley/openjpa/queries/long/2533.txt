Take this simple entity:

@Entity
@javax.persistence.NamedQuery(name = "TableNameInXmlEntity.findAll", query = "SELECT t FROM TableNameInXmlEntity t")
public class TableNameInXmlEntity implements Serializable {
    @Id
    private int myid;
.......

Take this simple XML mapping entry:

<entity-mappings..........
    <entity class="org.apache.openjpa.persistence.xml.TableNameInXmlEntity">
        <table name="TableNameInXml"/>
    </entity>
</entity-mappings>

With this code, take the following test to execute the named query:

        Query q = em.createNamedQuery("TableNameInXmlEntity.findAll");
        q.getResultList();

The following SQL will be generated:

SELECT t0.myid FROM TableNameInXmlEntity t0

Notice that 'TableNameInXmlEntity' is used, rather than 'TableNameInXml' (i.e. the name defined in the XML mapping file).

Rather than executing a named query, if we execute a query like the following:

Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT t FROM TableNameInXmlEntity t");
q.getResultList();

The following (correct) SQL will be executed:

SELECT t0.myid FROM TableNameInXml t0

Finally, if we executed the above query, and THEN execute the named query, all will work as expected.

I have a test I'll upload shortly which recreates the issue.

Thanks,
