I found a problem when create & use a generic embeddable entity. When javaagent parse classes we can see these messages :

1181  TEST  WARN   [main] openjpa.MetaData - OpenJPA cannot map field "org.apache.test.embeddable.TraceEntity.traceability.org.apache.test.embeddable.Tracer.next" efficiently.  It is of an unsupported type. The field value will be serialized to a BLOB by default.
1615  TEST  WARN   [main] openjpa.MetaData - OpenJPA cannot map field "org.apache.test.embeddable.TraceEntity.traceability.org.apache.test.embeddable.Tracer.next" efficiently.  It is of an unsupported type. The field value will be serialized to a BLOB by default.

I attached a maven project whit a unit test for reproducing these logs. (Tested with Netbeans 7.2RC)
