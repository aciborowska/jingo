Pinaki mentioned this condition in OPENJPA-1992, opening a separate issue to track the problem. 

The JPA spec indicates that positional and named parameters should not be mixed. From limited testing I believe queries like this do not work on trunk. To be consistent we should throw an exception when such a query is detected and inform the user of what went wrong.
