Looking to improve the efficiency of the DataCache and QueryCache. Benchmarking is showing that the constant conversion from the POJO format to and from the PCData format is taking its toll. After talking with Patrick on the subject, he pointed out the PCDataGenerator which enhances the Entities for use in the Cache (vs using whole new PCData objects). The use of the PCDataGenerator is configured via the openjpa.DynamicDataStructs property.
