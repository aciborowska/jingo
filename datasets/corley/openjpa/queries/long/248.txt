The code in parseForeignKey is not correct.  It is accidentally using the deleteAction setting for both the delete and update action settings.  This results in invalid SQL being generated (at least for DB2 since it doesn't like cascading updates).  This report will be used to correct these settings.  It looks like a simple case of cut-and-paste error.
