This issue was reported on the users mailing list by Shubbis who noticed reduced performance with OpenJPA when using M2M relationships. 

Further investigation makes it appear to be a scaling issue, for small numbers of queries OpenJPA may perform fine, but when the number increases (ie > 50) we start lagging behind.
