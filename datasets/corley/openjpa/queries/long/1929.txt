We have implemented an own ValueHandler by inheriting from AbstractValueHandler. 

If one reads from a query inside a transaction from a database, OpenJPA calls the handler (toDataStoreValue) of the unmodified query objects trying to write back to the database on commit, even though nothing has been manipulated.

The writting can only be avoided when leaving out the transaction block. 

This is no correct JPA behaviour as it should be possible to do read-only data processing within a JPA transaction.
