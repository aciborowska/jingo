The Geronimo JPA spec api bundle provides a mechanism that allows JPA providers that register as an OSGi service to be tracked.  The provider services can then be enumerated through an OSGi-enabled persistence resolver (also in the spec bundle).  This works fine (sort of) if only OpenJPA is the only provider registered, but breaks as soon another provider bundle registers in the environment.  

The issue is that the OpenJPA service registration mechanism does not specify a property required by the persistence tracker to distinguish one provider from another.
