When running openjpac Ant task on Java sources set to Java 7 compatibility, the following warning is shown:

    [javac] warning: Supported source version 'RELEASE_6' from annotation processor 'org.apache.openjpa.persistence.meta.AnnotationProcessor6' less than -source '1.7'

This is because AnnotationProcessor6.java contains:

@SupportedSourceVersion(RELEASE_6)

which according to JDK documentation means that this annotation processor is incompatible with Java 7.
