The transaction semantics and flow within container environment or with JTA resource type differs from locally managed transaction.
OpenJPA test harnesses do not have a facility to test functionality within a managed transaction without a full-blown ejb/application container.
This issue will develop a simple/basic JTA transaction manager to plug-in to openjpa.ManagedRuntime to exercise codepath for
managed transaction without needing a full-blown ejb/application container.
