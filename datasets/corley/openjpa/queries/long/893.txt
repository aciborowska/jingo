I was wondering what was the reason behind this specific StoreQuery not allowing named parameters, and wether there was a way to get around this situation. 

The original problem was that the TO_DATE Oracle function was not supported by JPQL parser, so i was forced into a native query, and at this point i'm forced to redo the whole query in a somewhat troublesome way, if any of you can provide me with an easy solution i would appreciate it.

Thank you in advance
