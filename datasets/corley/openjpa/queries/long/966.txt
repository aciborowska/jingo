Starting with Connector/J 3.1.7, a MySQL JDBC driver is available [2] that will automatically send queries to a read/write master, or a failover or round-robin loadbalanced set of slaves based on the state of Connection.getReadOnly() . 
OpenJPA can take advantage of this driver by setting up read-only property of the connection based on the dirty nature of the current transaction [1].
