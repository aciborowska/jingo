While testing another issue, I encountered a bug with the QuerySQLCache. If you execute JPQL that has query pagination, we recognize that and exclude the query from the cache[1]. If you execute the query once without pagination, then execute it again with pagination we will 'forget' about the pagination and return the entire result set. I'll attach a JUnit showing the issue.

[1] 1864  test  WARN   [main] openjpa.Runtime - Query "select e from simple e WHERE e.name=:name order by e.value" is removed from cache  excluded permanently. The following query is not cached because the query uses pagination: select e from simple e WHERE e.name=:name order by e.value.
