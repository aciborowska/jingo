I just updated to v2.1.0 from v2.0.1 and noticed that a query using TYPE()
<> X is no longer working. I have an abstract base class and two
subclasses. My query asks for all but one of the subclasses, like this:

SELECT d FROM AbstractClass d WHERE d._state = :state AND TYPE(d) <>
SubClassTwo

When I run this query with v2.1.0, the SQL is generated as if the query
said
"TYPE(d) = SubClassTwo", resulting in a match on
the SubClassTwo discriminator. I found a work-around using NOT IN:

SELECT d FROM AbstractClass d WHERE d._state = :state AND TYPE(d) NOT IN
(SubClassTwo)
