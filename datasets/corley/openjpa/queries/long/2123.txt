Came across a few items that could help with performance in certain scenarios.  I'll document each one as I determine the proper resolution.  The first one is that we were preparing the ability to print the SQL parameters even if no configuration properties were set requesting that capability.  This resulted in String and StringBuffer operations that were extra overhead on every interaction with the Connection.

More to come...
