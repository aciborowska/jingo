Committed a fix - pull request #9: https://github.com/apache/openjpa/pull/9

In some situations there are state elements in _derefCache HashSet causing ConcurrentModificationException because set has been modified during iteration.
Copy all elements into another set and calling the same deleteDeref(StateManagerImpl sm) function.
