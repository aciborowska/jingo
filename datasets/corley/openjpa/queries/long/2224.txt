The Enhancement try to Enhance my EntityListener.

The exception is caused by the JNDI lookup that i am performing in my EntityListener.

During the Enhancement processing, it looks like openjpa (Enhancement) is creating an
instance of your EntityListener.  The ctor for your EntityListener is
requiring a JNDI context and, of course, none exists in your build
environment.

public class EntityListener { 
    private BitacoraFacade bitacoraFacadeLocal;
    public EntityListener() {
        try 
{
            bitacoraFacadeLocal = (BitacoraFacade) UtilEJB.getEJBReference(BitacoraFacade.class);
        }
 catch (Exception ex) 
{
           ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
