The JSR 317 JPA 2.0 specs explicitly states that all java primitives (and primitive wrappers) can be used for primary keys. However, OpenJPA does not allow the boolean/Boolean types as primary keys or as part of compound primary keys.  Granted, this might not be a big deal since using a boolean/Boolean primary key would allow only two database records. But it might also be the case that a customer might want to use a boolean primary key to specify true/false Production/Development environment in their database. Just want to document this discrepacny (with the spec) for the sake of completeness.
