We have a problem with the OpenJPA @ManagedInterface annotation due to the OPENJPA-5 update for JDK 6.
Currently, the junit class in openjpa-persistence-jdbc/src/test/java/org/apache/openjpa/persistence/managedinterface/TestManagedInterfaces.java failures on JDK6 are ignored because -
@AllowFailure(message="On JDK6 Upgrade these tests are failing with wrong mapping. " +
    "Column PC_ID in ManagedInterfaceSup Table is not created. getPC() is " +
    "defined as property in ManageIFace sub-interface")
