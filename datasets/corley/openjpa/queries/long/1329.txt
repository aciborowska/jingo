I'm looking into OpenJPA's datacache. Config the cache enabled/disabled, cache size is not a problem and they do improve the performance. But from the guides, I can use OpenJPA's StoreCache/QueryCache extension to access(evict,pin...) the cache. 

But I don't know when the cache should be accessed to improve the performance? Is there any best practice for it ?
