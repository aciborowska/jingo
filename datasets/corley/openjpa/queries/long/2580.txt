I'm using the OpenJPA 2.3.0 with Postgresql 9.3 and Bitronix Transaction Manager 2.1.4.  I'm using BLOB streaming to write binary data into a LargeObject in the database.  When OpenJPA calls PostgresDictionary.getLargeObjectManager( ... ) I get a NullPointerException.

The problem appears to be in PostgresDictionary.getPGConnection( ... ).  The last line of that method passes the DelegatingConnection into the unwrapConnection(...) method.  It should pass the innerConn that gets resolved at the start of the method into the unwrapConnection(...) method.  

I recompiled the class with this change and now OpenJPA 2.3.0 works with blob streaming in my setup.
