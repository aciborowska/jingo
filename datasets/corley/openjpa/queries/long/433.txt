When updating a Timestamp field, OpenJPA is rounding the time to the nearest hundredth of a second.  For example, in this case I print the Timestamp to stdout just before committing the transaction.  Note the difference between the printed time and the time given in the SQL:

New time is 2007-11-04 21:16:49.906
4593  tally_ho  TRACE  [main] openjpa.jdbc.SQL - <t 1205211, conn 6232809> executing prepstmnt 8529229 UPDATE Article SET create_date = ? WHERE object_id = ? [params=(Timestamp) 2007-11-04 21:16:49.91, (long) 1]

This is actually causing a unit test of mine (one which checks that the create_date field updates correctly) to fail.  It's fairly easy to kludge around for now.
