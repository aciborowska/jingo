The new audit functionality is not yet part of a released version of OpenJPA. I've been testing 2.2.0-SNAPSHOT.

I've tested the Auditor functionality using normal (non-OSGi) unit tests and so far it seems to work. However, when trying the same functionality in OSGi (Karaf/Felix and also Felix using Pax-Exam), OpenJPA fails to find my Auditor class. Timothy Ward (on the Aries mailing list) suggested that it seems like OpenJPA is using its own class loader to load my Auditor class (which of course will not work). OpenJPA needs to use the class loader of the bundle containing the persistence.xml to load my Auditor class. I also believe this is the problem.

This has been discussed on both Aries and OpenJPA's mailing list:
