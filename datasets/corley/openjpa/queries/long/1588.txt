SVN revision 925451 was a little too much.  The changes now allow for the processing of the enum properties, javax.persistence.cache.retrieveMode and javax.persistence.cache.storeMode, which is good.  But, it also introduced the acceptance of the javax.persistence.sharedCache.mode.  But, this property is only valid when creating the EMF and, thus, does not have to be processed in this code path.

I am also correcting the spelling of the convertToKernelValue method (it was missing the "r" in Kernel).
