I was triying to use functions in my query as per the documentations however was getting errors when Functions are used with IN clause, same functions do work with comparator!!

Consider 2 entities
Employee[empId, lastName, firstName, mgrID] and 
Manager[mgrId, empId]


Failing query
Select e from Employee e where  CONCAT(firstName, lastName) IN ('First1Last1', 'First2Last2')

working Query
Select e from Employee e where  CONCAT(firstName, lastName) = 'First1Last1' OR CONCAT(firstName, lastName) = 'First2Last2'
