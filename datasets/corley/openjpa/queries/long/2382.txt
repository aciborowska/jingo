I have an entity with a property defined in this way:

  @Column(name = "type", columnDefinition = "char")
  private char type = 'C';

The column definition in the mysql table is char(1) and when I try to persist the entity I got an error saying that the column is not wide enough and the data would be truncated.

I then changed to column from char to varchar(10) and I discovered that openjpa is saving the ascii code of the char in the column instead of the char itself.

So for example I had a '67' value instead of 'C'.

The same program runs perfectly fine with Hibernate.
