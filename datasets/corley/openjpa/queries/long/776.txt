Firebird version 2.0 and later introduced sequences, which can be used with common SQL syntax (prior they called generators, and even old syntax is still supported, using new syntax is recommended). New Firebird dictionary is needed, which suports this sequence syntax. Also automatic dictionary selection mechanism should be improved to use this dictionary automatically, if Firebird 2.0 or later is encountered.
