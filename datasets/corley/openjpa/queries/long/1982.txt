Test case


https://github.com/riptano/hector-jpa/blob/compositeentityid/src/test/java/com/datastax/hectorjpa/store/ManyToOneIndexTest.java : basicFollowingPersistence

Store implementation:

https://github.com/riptano/hector-jpa/blob/compositeentityid/src/main/java/com/datastax/hectorjpa/store/CassandraStoreManager.java

When  cascading objects for collections, the flush and cascading of the objectId is not correctly set when a combination of @Entity and @Id annotations are used to create a composite entity.  The flush dependency requirements are currently undocumented for StoreManagers.  Is this the responsibility of the kernel to flush Entities in dependency order or the responsibility of the implementing StoreManager?
