This issue pertains to http://openjpa.208410.n2.nabble.com/Can-someone-explain-this-OpenJPA-trace-td7580862.html

Basically I'm seeing an unnecessary select statement of the form:
1487  test  TRACE  [main] openjpa.jdbc.SQL - <t 1920940938, conn 488448102> executing prepstmnt 163450945 SELECT t0.otherField1, t0.uniqueField1 FROM KeyClass t0 WHERE t0.pk = ? [params=(long) 0]

My application does millions of these so performance is suffering. I'll be attaching a test case to illustrate. testselect0.zip
