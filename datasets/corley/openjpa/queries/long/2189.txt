I decided to use the OpenBooks demo at the Impact 2012 conference.  And, since the Liberty Profile is the new, light-weight application server in the WebSphere family, I decided to attempt to deploy OpenBooks to my Liberty server.  The basic openbooks.war file worked just fine, but I had to make a few tweaks to the build scripts to get everyting just right.  This JIRA will be used to update these build scripts to make future usage of OpenBooks in the Liberty Profile a bit easier...

I have also updated the Wiki page on OpenBooks to include a section on the Liberty Profile.
