After a lot of testing I have reproduced a specific scenario where the MappingRepository instances grow, and eventually an OutOfMemory error will occur.  There have been other reports of this occuring, but no response from Apache yet, so I am opening a new bug.  I will attach the code wich causes the issue, and a screen shot of the memory leaking classes.
