OpenJPA is not differentiating between entity types with the same key when I use table per class.

Here's a snippet of my ode, 

            (Department) es.find(Department.class, "N/A");
            (PrintQueue) es.find(PrintQueue.class, "N/A");

Both Department and PrintQueue entities are based upon the same super class but I use table per class so they are in separate tables.

As you can see they both have the same key, but if I put the department line 1st the find of the print queue will generate a class cast exception trying to cast a Department to a PrintQueue. If I put the PrintQueue line 1st I will get a class cast exception trying to cast a PrintQueue to  a Department.  The second find doesn't generate any SQL  if I have trace logging turned on so it looks to me that it is a cache issue.
