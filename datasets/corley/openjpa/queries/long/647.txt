The org.apache.openjpa.meta.ClassMetaData caches the value of the DataCacheTimeout when it is first accessed. On a subsequent update of the OpenJPAConfiguration's  property this cached value is not cleared and the ClassMetaData instances in the repository that have initialized the DataCacheTimeout from either the parent class or the global default continue to use the old value. We need to build smarts in this class so that the configuration cache can be cleared on an update and this property reflects true dynamic behaviour.
