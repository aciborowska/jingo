Currently, Java type double is mapped to NUMERIC for HSQLDB:

HSQLDictionary.java, line 82
       doubleTypeName = "NUMERIC";



(see https://fisheye6.atlassian.com/browse/~tag=2.4.1/openjpa/tags/2.4.1/openjpa-jdbc/src/main/java/org/apache/openjpa/jdbc/sql/HSQLDictionary.java?hb=true).

This seems wrong to me, as HSQLDB's NUMERIC is not a binary floating point type, but represents exact decimal numbers and maps to Java type BigDecimal (see HSQL documentation: http://hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/sqlgeneral-chapt.html#sgc_numeric_types). The corresponding HSQL type for double is, according to this manual, REAL, FLOAT or DOUBLE (all being equivalent).
