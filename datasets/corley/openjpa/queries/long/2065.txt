Suppose we have an interface, A.

Suppose we have a JPA-compliant entity class, B, that implements A.

This construction will fail at runtime:

final TypedQuery<A> q = em.createNamedQuery("someNamedQuery", A.class);

Hibernate and EclipseLink both accept this construction.

I don't see anywhere in the JPA specification that the class parameter must denote an entity type.
