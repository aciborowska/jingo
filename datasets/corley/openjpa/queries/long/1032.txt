The 10/31/2008 draft of the JSR-317 specification added a method with signature "List getPositionalParameters()" to the Query interface. This method had a conflicting signature with a similar method defined on the OpenJPAQuery interface "Object[] getPositionalParameters()".  The OpenJPAQuery method was necessarily changed to match the specification.  The 03/13/2009 draft no longer provides a method with this signature so the previous signature will be put back in place.
