When openjpa.MetaDataRepository=Preload=true is configured, OpenJPA is able to eagerly load ALL metadata and remove locks from the repository. OpenJPA could do a better job to detect other conditions where we can eagerly load metadata. This can result in a much more scalable repository. 

One example that comes to mind is the <exclude-unlisted-classes> element that can be defined for a given persistence unit. When this element is encountered we know that all resources listed in the p.xml and orm.xml are all that we need to worry about.

I'm sure there are other cases where we could make the same leap but they aren't coming to my mind this afternoon.
