During the last few board meetings, the usage of Google Analytics to
track the usage of our web sites was discussed. While this is not a
problem per se, Google requires in its Terms and Conditions that all
sites using it must post a privacy policy (to be exact, paragraph 7 of
the Analytics Terms and Conditions at
http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html states that "You must post a
privacy policy and that policy must provide notice of your use of a
cookie that collects anonymous traffic data.")

The legal-discuss group, together with the Jackrabbit PMC and a number
of individuals has pursued this issue and drafted up a privacy policy
for Jackrabbit, which is available at
http://jackrabbit.apache.org/privacy-policy.html

The board would like to thank you for this and appreciates the effort
and diligence that went into it.

If your PMC is collecting information through Google Analytics (ATM
there are at least 18 PMCs using it; you know who you are), we expect
you to set up a privacy policy along the lines of the Jackrabbit PMC and
add a note to your next board report after you have done so. 

Thank you for your cooperation.

	For the Apache board
