The FinderCache retains a Map, associating a ClassMapping with a FinderQuery.  However, this cache does not factor in the characteristics of the FetchPlan that was active when a mapping is created, nor does it factor them to determine if a cache hit is appropriate.  This causes the find() operation to perform the same SQL as the first time it was executed, regardless of changes to the active FetchPlan afterwards.
