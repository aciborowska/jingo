This task is to provide support for the lock timeout hint on applicable interface methods.  OpenJPA currently supports the openjpa.LockTimeout property.  This support will be extended to allow more granular configuration at the method level, where applicable.  The pattern used for specifying lock modes at a method level should be considered for extension or as a guide.
