The PersistenceUtil.isLoaded() returns false for an attribute which has been defined as FetchType.EAGER although the attribute has been sucessfully accessed and printed out before.  

We detected this while integrating JSR-303 Bean Validation. Everthing worked fine with the exception of the SigningPackage entity. For this during the pre-update validation the TraversableResolver gets always an isLoaded = false from the PersistenceUtil for the 'owner' attribute, which is defined as FetchType.EAGER. This leads to the situation that no validation is performed at all. The test case shows that the owner can be accessed but the utility say not loaded afterwards. This is strange. If the fetch type is changed to FetchType.LAZY, everything works as expected.

Please let me know if you need more information.
