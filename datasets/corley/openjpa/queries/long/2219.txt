With some other vendor enum are often listed in persistence unit and migrating to openjpa we need to remove enum from the persistence unit.

I have no issue with this behavior but ignoring the enum in mappings will make it work out of the box and warning the user (instead of waiting the exception which is not so obvious "no metadata") is probably a nice enhancement
