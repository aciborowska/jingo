The OpenJPA build fails with an OutOfMemoryException on Playstation 3 while running unit tests.   I end up with a large core dump and other debug files.   The build is successful when I disable the unit tests.  Is there a way to run the build+unit tests on machines with limited memory (256mb core)?  

BTW, I have yet to get an OutOfMemoryException or javacore from Metal Gear Solid.  An OpenJPA build should be a piece of cake.
