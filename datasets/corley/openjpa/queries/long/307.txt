Property values, once defined, cannot be changed unless a redeployment happens with different property values. 

For example, fine tuning the behavior might need many property value changes until a good combination has been found. In order to optimize the process it is desirable that property values can be changed dynamically without requiring redeployment.

What would be required is a method isDynamic() or similar that allows to inquire if a given configuration property is dynamic configurable. If this is the case, a dynamic property value change is supported. If not, the only way to change the property value is through redeployment.
