SybaseDictionary explicitly removes the ability for to add FK constraints. Comments indicate that Sybase had trouble with these FK columns - but those problems are not apparent when running our unit test bucket. I suspect the problems with FK no longer manifest in recent versions of Sybase (tested with 15.0) .
