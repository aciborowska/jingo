I have an Entity (Course) with a simple @Embedded field and a @Lob. I do not use any LAZY attribution on them!


If I do a normal em.find, the entity will be loaded as a whole (all the fields, including the embedded and the lob will be fetched immediately).
Sidenote: the Lecturer referred in the select is defined as
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "course",
            cascade = 
{CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.REMOVE, CascadeType.MERGE}
,
            orphanRemoval = true, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @OrderColumn(name = "POSITION")
    private List<Lecturer> lecturers;

The following selects DO work

	"select c from Course c join c.lecturers l "
	"select distinct c from Course c"



The following selects create tons of subqueries! 1 separate sub-query for each @Embedded field, and also for each @Lob


	"select distinct c from Course c join c.lecturers l "
	"select distinct c from Lecturer l join l.course c"
	"select c from Lecturer l join l.course c"




This happens ONLY if I run this stuff against Oracle. In MySQL it seems to work properly.

I'll try to create a unit test for it.
