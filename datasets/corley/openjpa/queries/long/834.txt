The org.apache.openjpa.persistence.xmlmapping.xmlbindings.myaddress.Address is a class with JAXB annotations. It has a property street of type List<String>. When an entity containing Address in its state field is loaded from database, the street property is empty.

My initial investigation led me to a conclusion that the issue is caused by a proxy returned from ProxyManagerImpl.newCustomProxy(Object) which does not behave correctly.
