I am planning to migrate from TopLink Essentials. The application has an EJB tier so presentation logic must have access to Entity POJOs as feched in a session bean. That  should not a problem with the control provided by JPA fetching.

With TopLink Essentials fetching works well under GlassFish V2 and in Java SE standalone tests.

However OpenJPA fails in the attached testcase that closely maps the type of problem that we are facing in the container.

The workaround would be to "touch" all required properties in the session bean before the entities leave the persistence context. Such a workaround is not practical.

The attached testcase has a TopLink version for comparison. In both cases, a command line parameter has to be configured to match the absolute path:
-javaagent:dist\lib\openjpa-all-2.0.0-beta.jar
and
-javaagent:toplink-essentials-agent.jar

A switch CREATE_DATA_FIRST_TIME has to be set in the source code.

The testcase was created with the NetBeans IDE which includes the referenced TopLink library.
