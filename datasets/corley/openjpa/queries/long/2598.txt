We are using OpenJPA with SQL Server.  Currently, it uses the TOP syntax for pagination.  First, it will select the TOP 20.  Then, the TOP 40.  The pagination get progressively slower as more rows are returned.  SQL 2012 now supports Offset Fetch syntax.  Could support for this new syntax be added?
