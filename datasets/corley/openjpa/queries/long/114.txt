(from OPENJPA-5...)

To follow on to one of Marc's earlier comments... These updates to support the new JDBC 4 interfaces brings up another question. What about the support for the new data types introduced by JDBC 4 (NCHAR, NVARCHAR, LONGNVARCHAR, NCLOB)? Or, some of the new functionality provided by JDBC 4 (SQLException extensions, event listeners, etc). 

There is a lot of overlap between OPENJPA-4 and OPENJPA-5. Are these new JDBC 4 features another new JIRA issue? Maybe we have two main goals â€“ 1) Is just to get us buildable and runnable in a JDK 6 (JDBC 4) environment, and 2) exploit the new functions provided by JDK 6 (JDBC 4). Is (1) for OPENJPA-4 and (2) for OPENJPA-5? The discussions seem be blurring the lines and I'm just trying to get a handle on how much we're going to bite off with each JIRA Issue. Thanks.

I feel that this issue is merely to make it possible for OpenJPA to be compilable against Java 6/JDBC 4.

My personal opinion is that if we see new features in JDBC 4 that we want to take advantage of, a separate issue should be filed (with this issue as a dependency).

Oops... We have so many of these JDBC 4 type Issues that I screwed up with my earlier comment.  I should have been referencing this Issue (OPENJPA-5) as the "make it buildable" Issue. And, the OPENJPA-6 should be the "exploitable" Issue. But, maybe Marc is right. OPENJPA-6 could be used to make the Connection objects returned by OpenJPA more JDBC like. And, then create a totally separate Issue for exploiting new JDBC 4 features. I'll do that.
