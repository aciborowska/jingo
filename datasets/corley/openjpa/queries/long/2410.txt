Source files may have inadvertent System.out/err.print statements left in source files on commit. Ideally we don't want any of these changes being checked in and a large majority of the time logging facilities should be utilized. That being said, there are a number of cases where we don't have access to a logger and must use System.out/err.

This JIRA will be used to update our checkstyle to scan for unwanted print statements, and fail the build when/if they are encountered.
