I've tried to use a relation field as key for a java.util.Map, using a PersistentMap & MapKey annotation.

Ideally, such a mapping should be supported of course. For an example real-world use case, see the test case I'll attach (it's the same that I posted to the list last week).

According to Fay Wang on users@openjpa.apache.org, this is not possible today (v1.2.0), see http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/openjpa-users/200904.mbox/%3C188945.43609.qm@web55901.mail.re3.yahoo.com%3E (the short email exchange which lead to the creation of this JIRA).

According to Pinaki Poddar on http://n2.nabble.com/Map%3CClassA,ClassB%3E-problem-td534546.html this should work. Either way, the current error message ("Map field ...  is attempting to use a map table, but its key is mapped by another field.  Use an inverse key or join table mapping.") is unclear. 

At the very least, the documentation manual should clearly say that this is explicitly not supported, or include an example if it is, and/or a clear error message should be printed by the run-time. Ideally it should be a working and documenting mapping though...
