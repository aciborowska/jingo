The method FetchPlan.resetFetchGroups() restores and activates the "default" fetch group whether or not it is listed by the "openjpa.FetchGroups" property when that property is used.

When an EntityManager is created by a persistence unit definition utilizing "openjpa.FetchGroups" that omitted including "default" in its value, that EntityManager's initial FetchPlan honors the omission.  However, calling FetchPlan.resetFetchGroups() includes enabling "default" causing the reset FetchPlan to not be equivalent to the initial default FetchPlan.
