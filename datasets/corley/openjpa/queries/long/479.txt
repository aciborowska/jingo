Currently, having multiple fields of the same Embeddable type in an entity requires the use of the AttributeOverride annotation, so that the column name of the different fields won't clash. This is tiresome.
It would be helpful to have a MappingDefault option that would prefix the embedded field's column name with the field name.
For example:

@Embeddable
class Em {
   int foo;
}

@Entity 
class En {
   Em first;
   Em second;
}

Would create table EN with columns FIRST_FOO, SECOND_FOO.
