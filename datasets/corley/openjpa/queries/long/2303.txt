When an entity with a field like this:

 	@OneToMany(mappedBy="parent", fetch=FetchType.EAGER)
	@EagerFetchMode(FetchMode.JOIN)

is loaded with getSingleResult() for the second time, an Exception is thrown:

javax.persistence.NonUniqueResultException: Query "select A from EntityA A where A.id=1" selected 3 results, but expected unique result.

When i remove the @EagerFetchMode annotation everything works fine (but then n+1 selects are fired to load EntityA)

See attached Test Project.
