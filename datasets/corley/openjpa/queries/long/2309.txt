Since we're addressing other wiki concerns via defects and I don't want anybody else to be wasting time figuring out the solution, I'm creating this defect to show that I am working the problem.

All of the documentation links are broken from our wiki:  http://openjpa.apache.org/documentation.html

Also, the RELEASE-NOTES.html links on our download page are broken:  http://openjpa.apache.org/downloads.html

I have also searched out wiki pages and there are a few other references to our documentation that will need to be cleaned up.  I am working with the Apache Infra team to figure out a new location to store our documentation and fix up the links.
