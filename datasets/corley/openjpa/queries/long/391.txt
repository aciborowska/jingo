 bug which I am getting in OpenJPA is when  I am trying to query the 'Database View' it is returning the list of the Objects, but the data is inconsistent, it's returning the same data for all data objects. But when I query to the Table, it's returning consistent data. see the below data...

Did anybody worked in OpenJPA with Oracle Views or any Idea?????


Thanks,
