Steps are the following:
1) Persist an entity which has a many-to-many collection link;
2) Create related entity;
3) Merge first entity to another persistence context.
4) Try to lazily load collection - it does not get loaded.

If you reload the entity in a separate transaction through entityManger.find() before merging - lazy loading works.

Test project with two test cases attached (please run test methods separately).
