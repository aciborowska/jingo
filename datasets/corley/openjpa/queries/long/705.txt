When embedded entity is mapped to a secondary table, the primary key of the secondary table that refers to the owner table is named wrongly and different from the primaryKeyJoinColumn value specified in the @SecondaryTable annotation.

Originally reported in OpenJPA User forum [1] as the following example

@Entity
@Table(name = "CUSTOMER")
@SecondaryTable(name = "CUSTOMER_EXT", 
                                  pkJoinColumns = @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = "CUST_ID", referencedColumnName = "CUST_ID"))

public class Customer {
   @Embedded
   @AttributeOverrides( 
{
   @AttributeOverride(name = "from", column = @Column(name = "FROM_DT", table = "CUSTOMER_EXT")),
   @AttributeOverride(name = "to", column = @Column(name = "TO_DT", table = "CUSTOMER_EXT"))}
 )
    private DateRange dr; 

The mapping should generate CUSTOMER_EXT table with 3 columns: CUST_ID, FROM_DT, TO_DT.

However, it generates a column named DATERANGE_CUST_ID instead of CUST_ID as specified in  @SecondaryTable annotation.
