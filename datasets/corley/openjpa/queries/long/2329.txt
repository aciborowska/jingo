Please close all JDBC Metadata statements after execution  in OpenJPA to avoid a potential interaction issue with Derby Network Client.  See details at: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6055.

The statement can be obtained with ResultSet.getStatement() e.g.

      for (int i = 0; i < 50000; i++) {
                ResultSet rs = conn.getMetaData().getSchemas();
                while (rs.next()) 
{
                    //System.out.println("SCHEM NAME = " + rs.getString(1));
                }
                rs.getStatement().close();  <====
            } 



In debugging a recent DERBY client/OpenJPA interaction issue, I saw in  that  there were a fair number of JDBC metadata Result Sets that  did not get cleaned up until garbage collection kicked in. 

There is a program in-lined in  the description of DERBY-6055 that shows how metadata statements can build up and could potentially exceed the maximum number of sections if garbage collection did not kick in on time on a loaded system. 

Sorry for the lack of OpenJPA version detail and repro as I don't have any personal experience with OpenJPA and was not able to get information on OpenJPA version from the user.  The user's primary statement issue was a different so they did not have time to follow up on this potential one.
