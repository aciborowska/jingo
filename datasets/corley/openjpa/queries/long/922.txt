I have an Entity and one of its fields is defined as CHAR(16) FOR BIT DATA NOT NULL.

When trying to persist the entity, I get the following error:

   Error: SQLCODE=-301, SQLSTATE=07006, SQLERRMC=1, DRIVER=3.50.152  
   {prepstmnt 1386959531 INSERT INTO NULLID.TESTTBL (tkiid) VALUES (?)  
   [params=(InputStream) java.io.ByteArrayInputStream@75947594]}

It seems that the wrong kind of set is being used to set the parameter on the prepared statement.
