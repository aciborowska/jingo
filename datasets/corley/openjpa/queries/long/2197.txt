AnnotationPersistenceMetaDataParser contains a MethodComparator which only compares the class + the method name. Too bad I have (had...) 2 methods with the same name in my EntityListener:

    @PreUpdate
    public void updateChangeLog(Object entity) { ..

and also

    private void updateChangeLog(BaseEntity he, ChangeLogEntry cle)

which is a private helper method.

Due to the bug in MethodComparator, my @PreUpdate sometimes didn't get detected.
