See http://openjpa.208410.n2.nabble.com/Issues-with-GeneratedValue-and-SequenceGenerator-td6244055.html

When using final methods for the id field, the generated id is unavailable for the application.
According to the mailing list, final methods are not supported, but the OpenJPA documentation sais so:
http://openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.1.0/apache-openjpa-2.1.0/docs/manual/jpa_overview_pc.html#jpa_overview_pc_final
So at least the documentation should be changed.

An error message at runtime would also be fine - that would be also related to
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-465
