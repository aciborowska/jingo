when CascadeType.PERSIST is enabled the finder is generated with IS NULL on PK filed and cached in FinderCacheImpl using the generated SQL with IS NULL Subsequent finder will use the cached SQL even if PK value is assigned resulting in wrong sql execution 

Below in sample of SQL retrived from the cache after PK is assigned 

SELECT t1.TECH_CLSTYP, t1.TECH_LOCK, t1.MYORG_CREATION_DATE, t1.MYORG_CREATION_TIME, t1.MYORG_MODIF_DATE, t1.MYORG_MODIF_TIME, t1.CREATION_DATE, t1.CURRENT_STATUS, t1.CURRENT_STATUS_DATE, t1.CURRENT_SUB_STATUS, t1.ORG_BOID, t1.ORG_BOVERSION, t1.BIL_FIRST_DATE, t1.BIL_FREQUENCY_BOCD, t1.BOID, t1.END_DATE, t1.MAX_NGINS, t1.MAX_USERS, t1.NEXT_BIL_DATE, t1.OPERATOR_BOID, t1.OPERATOR_BOVERSION, t1.SAP_CTRACT_NB, t1.START_DATE FROM T_SBH_CTRACT t0, T_CTRACT t1 WHERE t1.TECH_CLSTYP = ? AND t0.BOID IS NULL AND t0.BOID = t1.BOID

Parameters (1, 200821) is used for TECH_CLSTYP not for BOID (TECH_CLSTYP is DiscriminatorColumn and BOID is PK )

the only workaround for now is by disabling SQL finder cache
