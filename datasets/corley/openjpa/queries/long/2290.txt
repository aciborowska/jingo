I have a entity with Long id. When I merge a new entity. OpenJPA always query db with id = 0.
The new entity's id == null, Why it query the db and translate the null to 0?

The ApplicationIds.create() returns 0 LongId on a pc with null id. This cause openjpa query db with 0 id. When there have a id==0 entity in the db you will have some trouble.

If I use GenerateType.IDENTITY with hsqldb, the id will generated start from 0. So If I run merge(new Entity()) two times, I only got one entity.
