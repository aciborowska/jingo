@Column provides the precision and scale attributes, but there's no (easy) way to figure out how it affects the way OpenJPA works if any. It looks like OpenJPA reads the type of a persistent field and when it's double it maps it to DOUBLE in Derby regardless of the other attributes. When precision and scale are specified, a DDL should use NUMERIC(precision, scale) or its synonim - DECIMAL(precision, scale).
