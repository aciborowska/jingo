Currently OpenJPA allows a connection factory (datasource) to be provided at EntityManager creation time. A user (Hyndavi) expressed interest in expanding this support on the dev mailing list. Specifically Hyndavi would like to allow individual connections to be passed in to an EntityManager - to better integrate with an existing framework. 

For reference the posts to the mailing list can be seen at http://markmail.org/thread/mxng5lkheib5iuqf
