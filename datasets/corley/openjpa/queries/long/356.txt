When executing a query that selects a literal value, OpenJPA converts the literal into a parameter in the SQL SELECT clause. In DB2, such parameters must be CAST to the appropriate type.

Note that this is not reproducible via OpenJPA's JPA bindings, as JPQL does not allow literals in the SELECT clause. However, the OpenJPA query parse trees do allow this syntax, and Kodo's JDO bindings allow such constructs.
