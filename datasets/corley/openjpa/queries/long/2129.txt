I am trying to execute Junit test for ORM mapping using OPENJPA2.1.1
Getting below Duplicate OpenJPA meta data warning     
[main] openjpa.MetaData - Found duplicate metadata or mapping for "class xxx.xxx".  Ignoring.

It is not able to execute actual code. There are no two mapping files with same content. It seems OpenJPA parsing the same orm.xml location twice.

It seems there is a bug. Please look into this issue and fix it or suggest alternative solution as soon as possible.
