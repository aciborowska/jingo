derby fails with duplicate primary key(s) in group by list

With query "select o.customer, avg(o.amount) from Order o group by o.customer" the push-down query contains duplicate columns in the group by clause.  This is okay when DB2 and other DB that tolerate the duplicates but Derby returns error.

Of course, we can ask fix on Derby but we can also easy fix in OpenJPA to avoid duplicates in the group by list.  Please refer to the following for the error result and the attach patch for the fix.

Output from running the query that generate duplicate in the group by list:
