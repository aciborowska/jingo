PostgresDictionary should set "63" (or something correct) as "maxAutoAssignNameLength", in order to let DBDictionary#getGeneratedKeySequenceName() generate correct names for IDENTITY sequences.

OpenJPA trims IDENTITY sequence names longer than 32 characters, while PostgreSQL uses longer names for BIGSERIAL sequences. So, persisting entities with @Id column with GenerationType.IDENTITY often results in a database error such as :
        org.apache.openjpa.lib.jdbc.ReportingSQLException: ERROR: relation "x_school_membershi_entityid_seq" does not exist 
{prepstmnt 2398193 SELECT CURRVAL(X_SCHOOL_TRANSFER_entityId_SEQ')}
 [code=0, state=42P01]

The followings are the examples. "OK"s are the sequence names which PostgreSQL uses. "NG"s are those which OpenJPA attempts to use.

Ex.1 -
        Table : X_SCHOOL_TRANSFER_EVENT
        BIGSERIAL Column : ENTITYID
   OK : X_SCHOOL_TRANSFER_EVENT_ENTITY_ID_SEQ
   NG : 'X_SCHOOL_TRANSFER__ENTITYID_SEQ

Ex.2 -
        Table : X_SCHOOL_MEMBERSHIP
        BIGSERIAL Column : ENTITYID
   OK : X_SCHOOL_MEMBERSHIP_ENTITYID_SEQ
   NG : X_SCHOOL_MEMBERSHI_ENTITYID_SEQ
