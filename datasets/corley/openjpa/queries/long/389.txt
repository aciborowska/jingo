If update is requested by a native query and it is the only method run in the application, 
following query.executeUpdate(), 
em.getTransaction().commit(0 is not issuing database commit.
If after that, em.close() was not issued, any subsequent query againt the same table which involved in the previous 
native query update will get blocked.
