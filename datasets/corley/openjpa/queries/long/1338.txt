Single persisted entity x with embeddable e.  e has a map of 3 pairs of Integer keys/values (1/100,2/200,3/300).

This query should be allowed...
SELECT e FROM entityTable x JOIN x.mapKeyIntegerEmbed e JOIN e.notMapKeyInteger i WHERE VALUE = 200

OpenJPA complains that "identifier "i" in "VALUE" operator is not valid in conditional expression. Per JSR 317, section 4.4.4 this operator is optionally allowed.
