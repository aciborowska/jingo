This discussion shows that a missing object reference in a jpql query sub-select produces a cryptic exception message.  Pinaki has shown that the message is much clearer in trunk (2.0.x).  If this new message processing is sufficient, then maybe this can be back ported to 1.2.x?  But, maybe this new exception processing is dependent on the new sub-select processing architecture that was developed as part of JPA 2.0.
