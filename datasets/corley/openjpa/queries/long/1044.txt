Multi-threaded query execution with an entity/embddable reference as parameter causes thread deadlock intermittently. Further investigation is required. Difficult to reproduce as the error seems to depend both on database used and execution. Currently the test will be deactivated till we find a definitive reproducible scenario and a (possible) resolution.
