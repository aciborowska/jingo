In process of configuring plugins in JDBCConfiguration, a javax.sql.DataSource is examined for the custom properties defined on the data source.
 public DataSource getDataSource() has undesired side effects that instantiates DBDictionary.

 DecoratingDataSource createConnectionFactory() does not have the side effects.
This private method is changed to public to be visible to the extended JDBCConfigurationImpl.
