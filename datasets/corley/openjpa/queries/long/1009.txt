JPA 2.0 has introduced a specification for strictly-typed dynamic query construction. The type-strictness is based on availability of a meta-model. The user application can either use meta-model API to access the type information or instantiate the meta-model (referred as canonical meta-model) with a set of auto-generated classes for compile-time binding. This issue refers to populating the canonical meta-model at runtime.
