In persistence.xml, a schema is defined for persistence unit with

<property name="openjpa.jdbc.Schema" value="hukuk" />

when an insertion occurs postgresql complains as

database problem - HATA: "dava_id_seq" nesnesi mevcut deÄŸil 
{prepstmnt 22074838 SELECT CURRVAL('Dava_id_SEQ')}
 [code=0, state=42P01]

in turkish meaning that: there is no dava_id_seq object,

which was a sequence under the hukuk schema

The schema defined in persistence.xml is not used for sequence names.

Workaround:
create an entry in persistence.xml as

<property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" value="postgres(LastGeneratedKeyQuery=SELECT CURRVAL(''
{1}
_
{0}
_SEQ''))" />

I think, there must be a correction in DBDictionary of postgresql.
