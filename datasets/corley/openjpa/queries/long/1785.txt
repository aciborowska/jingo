I have an Entity which has a @ElementCollection of Embeddables which has a @Lob and it fails when resolving MetaData. This only fails when using the Oracle DBDictionary and works on all other platforms I've tested (DB2, MySql, Derby). This isn't dependent on the version of Oracle because it fails before we ever connect to the DB. I haven't had time to look at this one, but I'll post a patch with a test case shortly here.
