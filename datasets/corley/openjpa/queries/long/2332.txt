This error message does not give sufficient information to debug the situation.  Users don't know how or why they got to this point in the processing:

no-driver: A JDBC Driver or DataSource class name must be specified in the \
	ConnectionDriverName property. Available properties in configuration \
	are "
{0}".

Without getting too wordy for a single message, I'm planning to update this message as follows.  I also plan to add some additional Trace points to help with debugging the issue.

no-driver: Attempting to use persistence.xml properties to resolve the datasource. \
    A JDBC Driver or DataSource class name must be specified in the \
    openjpa.ConnectionDriverName or javax.persistence.jdbc.driver property. \
    Available properties in the configuration are "{0}
