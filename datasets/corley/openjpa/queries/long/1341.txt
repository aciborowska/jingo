It has been reported that PostRemove is not invoked after database delete but invoked after flush().
This is in disagreement with JPA 2.0 Spec (Section 3.5.2) which states

"
 1. The PostPersist and PostRemove callback methods are invoked for an entity after the entity has been made persistent or removed. 
 2. These callbacks will also be invoked on all entities to which these operations are cascaded. 
 3. The PostPersist and PostRemove methods will be invoked after the database insert and delete operations respectively. 
     These database operations may occur directly after the persist, merge, or remove operations have been invoked or they 
     may occur directly after a flush operation has occurred (which may be at the end of the transaction).
