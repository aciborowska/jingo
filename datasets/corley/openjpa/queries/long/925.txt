A test scenario uncovers a bug in eager loading bidirectional OneToOne relation.

  OneOneParent  has a bidirectional OneToOne relation with OneOneChild as annotated as following:

@Entity
public class OneOneParent {
...
    @OneToOne(mappedBy="parent")
    private OneOneChild child;
}

@Entity
public class OneOneChild {
...
    @OneToOne
    private OneOneParent parent;
}

Testcase:

String query = "select c FROM OneOneChild c";
        Query q = em.createQuery(query);
        List list = q.getResultList();

        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) 
{
            OneOneChild c = (OneOneChild) list.get(i);
            assertEquals(c, c.getParent().getChild());
        }

We expect c equals c.getParent().getChild(), but instead got assertion failure.

It seems to be a bug introduced in performance improvement work (the related issues: OPENJPA-292 & OPENJPA-744).
