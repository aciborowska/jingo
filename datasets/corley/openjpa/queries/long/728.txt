When using a subquery containing EXISTS, the generated SQL contains table aliases that does not exist in the select statement. For example, the following query:

      SELECT new test.dto.EmployeeReportDTO(e.name, a.city)
      FROM Employee e JOIN e.address a 
      WHERE e.name LIKE :name
      AND EXISTS (SELECT p.number from PhoneNumber p WHERE p.owner = e)

will cause the following exception:

Column not found: T3.CITY in statement [SELECT t0.name, t3.city FROM Employee t0 INNER JOIN Address t1 ON t0.address_id = t1.id WHERE (t0.name LIKE ? ESCAPE '\' AND NOT (EXISTS (SELECT t2.number FROM Address t1, PhoneNumber t2 WHERE (t2.owner_id = t0.id))))]
