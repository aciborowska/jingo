@PersistenceContext is currently supporting java.lang.annotation.Target: TYPE, METHOD and FIELD java.lang.annotation.ElementType.

We need to enhance it to also support ElementType's: CONSTRUCTOR and PARAMETER so that we can support Injection in immutable objects that say don't provide setters and only accept parameters via constructor storing them in final fields.

Please let me know if I can in any way assist on implementing this.
