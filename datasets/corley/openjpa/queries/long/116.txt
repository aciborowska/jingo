EntityManager.getDelegate() should throw an IllegalStateException if the EntityManager has been closed. 

I noticed then when debugging other problems. According to the javadoc http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html#getDelegate() we need to throw an exception if the EM has been closed. 

In case I missed anything here's what I did to reproduce the problem. 


        EntityManagerFactory _emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("test");

        EntityManager em = _emf.createEntityManager();

        em.close();

        try 
{
            Object o = em.getDelegate();
            fail();
        }
        catch(IllegalStateException ise) 
{
            System.out.println("Caught expected exception");
        }
