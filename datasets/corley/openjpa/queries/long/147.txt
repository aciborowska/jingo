According to JavaDoc, OpenJPAEntityManager.createInstance() method 
       public <T> T createInstance(Class<T> cls);
     behaves as follows:

"Create a new instance of type <code>cls</code>. If <code>cls</code> is
  an interface or an abstract class whose abstract methods follow the
  JavaBeans convention, this method will create a concrete implementation
  according to the metadata that defines the class"

The method fails when T is an interface. The failure may be due to incorrect user configuration, however, further
information on this extension method is not available in OpenJPA documentation.

Firstly, how to specify metadata for a interface that has bean-style methods? 
Possibilities are:
a) Annotating the Java interface definition with @Entity 
b) Specifying in <class>org.acme.IPerson</class> in persistence.xml

Either of the above fails. a) fails at parsing b) fails with "no metadata" 

There may be a correct but undocumented way of specifying a managed interface. If that is the case, then this JIRA report should be treated as a documentation bug.
