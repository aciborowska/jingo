Hello,

the generated SQL (create table ...) contains foreign key contraint names that are longer than MaxConstraintNameLength (i.e. more than 64 characters using MySQLDictionary). I had a brief look at the code and i think that DBDictionary.getValidForeignKeyName() sould be called somewhere, but it doesn't.
