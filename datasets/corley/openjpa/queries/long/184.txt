When using DB2 database and the SQLException occurs 
if the SQLException instance supports the DB2Diagnosable interface, 
extended error information from the SQLCA will be written to the SQL channel. 
The message format produced by DB2Diagnosable writer is

	 SQLCA OUTPUT[Errp=SQLDMISR, Errd=[-2146893819, 5, 0, 0, -957, 0]]
Errp is the name of the DB2 module that detected the error and Errd are 6 integers of diagnostic information, SQLWARN are 6 characters 
of warning flags..  Often this additional information can be used by an administrator in doing problem determination.

This message will be appended to the persistence exception error message already created by OpenJPA
and it will be written to SQL logging channel (if active).

DB2Dictionary class is modified to use java reflection on the SQLException instance to determine 
if it supports DB2Diagnosble methods "getErrp" and if so 
it invokes the methods to retrieve Errp and Errd fields, formats and logs the error message.
Reflection is used so that the DB2Dictionary does not contain any compile time or runtime 
dependency on the DB2 jdbc driver.  If the DB2Diagnosable methods do not exist on the SQLException
instance,  no extended error information is logged.  

org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.sql.SQLException class is modified so in the event of an exception 
if the Dictionary is DB2, to call the Dictionary routines above.
