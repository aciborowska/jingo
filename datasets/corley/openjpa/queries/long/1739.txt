I've been working in a pluggable instrumentation framework for OpenJPA that could provide out-of-band accessibility instrumentation of various components.  I've started with the simple ones, DataCache & QueryCache , since they are currently instrumented (in-band).  The framework provides pluggability of instrumentation providers and components via standard configuration.  I have a JMX-based implementation in the works, but the framework will be designed such that other providers and instrumentation can be plugged in as well.  The JMX provider will allow for remote, out-of-band monitoring (and eventual control) of whatever is being instrumented.  For example, caches, SQL execution, enhancement, etc. could be instrumented.  I'll be incrementally committing bits and pieces of this function over the next several weeks for comment & review.
