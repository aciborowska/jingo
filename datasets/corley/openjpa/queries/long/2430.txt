Derby is not listed among data bases that support LOB member fields, cf.
The OpenJPA manual for version 2.2.2, section 7.7.11 LOB Streaming.

See also the issue experienced by a user here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6341

I found that by overloading getLobField in DerbyDictionary (effectively materializing the LOB) I could make the user's example work. Cf. the code shown here:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6341?focusedCommentId=13777419&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13777419

Would adding this overload be a possible way forward for the Derby support? I'm willing to make a proper patch if so.
