We are using openjpa 2.1.1 in our environment. Recently, we have upgraded log4j logging framework from log4j1.2.16 to log4j2.3. But, after the upgrade, we noticed issues as openjpa 2.1.1 is making use of log4j1.2.x classes. Is there any openjpa version compatible with log4j2? Or is there a way to overcome this dependency issue?

Thanks in advance
