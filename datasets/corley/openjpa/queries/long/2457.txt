While creating an implementation of ReverseCustomizer I came across tables that are not mapped and passed to MyReverseCustomizer.unmappedTable(...) method.  I would like to map the tables in much the same way the ReverseMappingTool would if it could map the tables; therefore, I'd like to use the same name converter implemented in getClassName.  getFieldName is public so I can map the fields the same as the ReverseMappingTool, so why not getClassName?

Note, using the getClassName method on MyReverseCustomizer won't help since the ReverseMappingTool has already by-passed that method and called unmappedTable.
