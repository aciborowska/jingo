When I changed the OpenJPA APIs before the 1.0 release, I made a number of incompatible changes. At the time, we deemed that this was fine since 1.0 was the first OpenJPA release. However, it turns out that this runs up against BEA policy, since BEA shipped a product using a build from around 0.9.7. So, we'd like to do some work to address this where possible.
