A rather simple JPQL query produces an unnecessary table join.
Please refer to the attached testcase (NetBeans project).

JPQL:

select
    object(emp)
from
    Employee emp
    , in(emp.projects) proj
where
    proj.id = :projectId


The generated native SQL is:

SELECT
    t0.id
    , t0.name
FROM
    Employee t0
    INNER JOIN Employee_Project t1 ON t0.id = t1.EMPLOYEE_ID
    INNER JOIN Project t2 ON t1.PROJECTS_ID = t2.id
WHERE (
    t1.PROJECTS_ID = ?)

The generated SQL should be like the following, in other words the project table should not be included.

SELECT
    t1.ID
    , t1.NAME
FROM
    , EMPLOYEE_PROJECT t2
    , EMPLOYEE t1
WHERE (
    (t2.projects_ID = ?)
    AND ((t2.Employee_ID = t1.ID)
)
