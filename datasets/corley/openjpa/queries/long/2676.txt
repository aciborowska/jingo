In openjpa there are classes which is not using proper toLower()/toUpper(). The issue is that if the server relies on the default locale and if the process was started with some non English compatible locale such as Turkish, toUpper/Lower will yield an incorrect result. For instance "URI".toLowerCase() will result in "urı" instead of "uri". The same applies to toUpperCase -> "uri".toUpperCase() will become "URİ" and checks like "string.toUpperCase().equals(someConstant)" will fail.
