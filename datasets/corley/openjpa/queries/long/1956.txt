2 persistent classes :
A
B extends A.

A have the primary key : id.

I was using fetch plan to include id but with the wrong class.
I badly added a fetch plan for B.class, id.

id was null, because it was finally not included in the fetch plan.
This is OK but when I build the fetch plan, why not raising an error message with something like :
"no attribute id on B".

It took me ages to find my error.
After I added the correct fetch plan : A.class, id, everything works fine.
