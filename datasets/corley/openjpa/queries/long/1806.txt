I attempted to execute this JPQL query:

select o from Organization o where :hostName member of o.hostNames

where o.hostNames is a collection of HostName, which is an embeddable class.  In other words, hostNames is an ElementCollection.  The parameter hostName is also an instance of HostName.  I got the following error:

"Error message: JPQL query does not support conditional expression over embeddable class."

I am logging this as a bug because "member of" should work with element collections in this manner.  Apparently it does with EclipseLink:

There is also a bug logged on the Hibernate JIRA for this issue, HHH-5209.
