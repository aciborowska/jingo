Hello,

@DiscriminatorColumn(discriminatorType=DiscriminatorType.CHAR) doesn't work under Sybase, it creates a numeric / integer  column.

This is because of the default "storeCharsAsNumbers = true" in the DBDictionary (what's that good for? why would you want to store-char-as-numbers ??).

Setting storeCharsAsNumbers = false is still not enough, as that will lead to a CHAR(255). You also need to add "fixedSizeTypeNameSet.addAll(Arrays.asList(new String[]
{ "CHAR" }));" to a custom DBDictionary. (Wouldn't it make sense to have CHAR in fixedSizeTypeNameSet by default for all DBDictionaries?)

I'm assuming all of the same also applies to Java Entity attributes of Type char, not just DiscriminatorType.CHAR (but haven't further looked into this).

PS: With a custom DBDictionary with { storeCharsAsNumbers = false; fixedSizeTypeNameSet.addAll(Arrays.asList(new String[]{ "CHAR" }
)); } in the constructor this does work; so I have a work-around for this, just posting this for the benefit of other OpenJPA/Sybase users.
