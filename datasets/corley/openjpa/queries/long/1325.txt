Embeddable meta-data defined in XML may fail to resolve during the enhancement phase in a container environment when all classes are not listed in the pu.  The metadata parser currently defers embedabble metadata population until after the access type of the embeddable is determined.    Instead, the parser should wait until the embeddable is fully resolved before populating value metadata in embedding types since classes may be enhanced in any order.
