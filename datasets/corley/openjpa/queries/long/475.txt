I am using a  consolidated 1.0.1 JAR as a dependency for a Maven project. It would great to have Maven download the OpenJPA 1.0.1 sources and reference them from generated Eclipse .classpath file (I use 'mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse' goals). This is very convenient when debugging or even simply to trying to understand how OpenJPA works underneath, or using other IDE features (javadocs on mouse hovers)

I am not sure how the the consolidated released JAR is being published, but Maven usually publishes source JARs to the Maven repository when the user performs a release.

Thanks.
