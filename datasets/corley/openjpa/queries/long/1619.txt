The org.apache.openjpa.persistence.jdbc.update.TestTimestampVersion.testBulkUpdateOnTimestampedVersion() test fails intermittently on MySQL, MSSQL, DB2 and sometimes Derby depending on which server the tests run on (almost always Windows) and how much load is on the server (multiple VMs running builds/tests).
