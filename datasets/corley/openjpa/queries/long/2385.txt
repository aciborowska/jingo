In the OpenJPA user manual, section 3.1 " Callback Methods" we read this :
PrePersist: Methods marked with this annotation will be invoked before an object is persisted. This could be used for assigning primary key values to persistent objects. This is equivalent to the XML element tag pre-persist.

But this is not the behavior obtained.
