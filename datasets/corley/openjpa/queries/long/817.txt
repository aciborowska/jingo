The ConstraintUpdateManager does a good job of ordering inserts, updates and deletes when the internal metadata is complete. If the internal metadata is not complete (ie there are no @ForeignKey annotations) SQL statements are executed in an arbitrary order. 

The application can avoid this by adding the appropriate annotations, or by obtaining the data from the database, but we can make some attempt to preserve the order of execution.
