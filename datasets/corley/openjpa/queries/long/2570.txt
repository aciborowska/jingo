In JIRA OPENJPA-1608, a fix was added to the InformixDictionary which causes the following SQL to be executed on each connection:

"SET ENVIRONMENT RETAINUPDATELOCKS 'ALL'" 

I've had a request to allow a user to disable this option should they so choose.  This JIRA will be used to simply add a property to allow a user to disable this SQL.  By default this SQL will remain as-is today.

Thanks,

Heath Thomann
