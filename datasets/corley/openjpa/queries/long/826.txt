I am reviewing code because of slices concurrency/multithreaded issues, and I see that some code in QueryImpl was too aggressive in their locks.  So I reviewed QueryImpl and BrokerImpl...

Mainly: assertMethods do not need to be within the lock.

Then I found a few methods that were doing precondition/shortcut checking, but all within locks, so that seemed like a waste:

1) QueryImpl.setCandiateExtent; checks to see if value setting is same as current value

2) these places check to see if it needs to calculate the value of not:
QueryImpl.isUnique, QueryImpl.setCandiateExtent, QueryImpl.getCandidateType, QueryImpl.getResultType, QueryImpl.getParameterDeclaration
