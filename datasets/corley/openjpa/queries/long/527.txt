If a transient new object is merged containing a one-to-many (with elementjoincolumn) list of transient new objects the last object in the list is the only object persisted.  This functionality has changed since 1.0.1 as the same code worked properly with that version.

Calling persist using an equivalent object works properly but this should work in both cases.

I'll attach a tgz of a maven project that illustrates the problem.  The project uses hsqldb internally and should run stand alone without anything but maven and java installed.
