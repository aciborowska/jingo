As discussed on the email thread 'Disable dangerous "fallback enhancement" how?' on users@openjpa.apache.org (e.g. on http://markmail.org/message/5e2yfcp3w3vhmrob?q=Disable+dangerous+%22fallback+enhancement%22+how%3F+list:org%2Eapache%2Eopenjpa%2Eusers), I hereby suggest that by default, OpenJPA behaves as if openjpa.RuntimeUnenhancedClasses=unsupported was explicitly configured. 

(Copy/paste) The fact that https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-293 is still an Open New Feature, with five open sub-tasks (so technically this development was never finished, yet it's automatically activated and shows up in the official doc) and in e.g. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-444 (and may be others?) there are bug reports which are probably only due to this, may support my point of view?

Craig (Craig.Russell@...) appears to support this proposed Improvement (judging from his email lundi, 23. juin 2008 21:33 in same thread).

I'd love to see this in 1.1.1. May be due to backward compatibility you jugde it would be safer to put this in 1.2.0 only? - Or is too late and impossible to change this default now? Hope not!

PS: Workaround for 1.1.0 is openjpa.RuntimeUnenhancedClasses=unsupported (undocumented, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-650).
