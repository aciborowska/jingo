According to JavaDoc, OpenJPAEntityManager.createInstance() method 
       public <T> T createInstance(Class<T> cls);
     behaves as follows:

"Create a new instance of type <code>cls</code>. If <code>cls</code> is
  an interface or an abstract class whose abstract methods follow the
  JavaBeans convention, this method will create a concrete implementation
  according to the metadata that defines the class"

The method fails when T is an abstract class.
