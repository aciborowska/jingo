I created QueryCache and DataCache implementations for EhCache. I think it would be great to see this included in a future version of OpenJPA, as presently, OpenJPA includes only its own implementation.

The code is licensed under the APL 2.0 and includes unit tests.

My implementation is based on the work of Pinaki Poddar, who created a DataCache implementation for Coherence - I think that would also be nice to include.

Thanks!
