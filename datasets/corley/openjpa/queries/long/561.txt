Consider the following class hierarchy

S



_ F


_ B


_ B1


_ B2





Inheritance strategy is JOINED, there is use of a discriminator column, and a foreign relation exists between F and B, in our setup the relation was OneToMany from B to F (i.e. F is the owning side).
The DB contains a single F instance related to a single B1 instance.
The following JPQL queries are performed:
    SELECT b FROM B2 b
    SELECT f FROM F f

Then:
We receive a warning saying that the B1 instance is orphaned AND the field in the F instance pointing to the B1 instance remains null.
This only happens when B and F both extend S. In that case the VerticalClassStrategy causes the bug. From what little we gleaned, it seems that OpenJPA attempts to extract the concrete type of F's reference to B (should be B1) from the wrong sql query, resulting in an object id of type F and id of the B1 instance. This oid is corrupt.
