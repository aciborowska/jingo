In StateManagerImpl.proxyFields(), we blindly replace the proxy fields as long as they loaded.  We can be slightly more efficient if we also verify that the field has been dirtied before doing the replacement.

The original intent of this JIRA was to just resolve the issue with proxyFields.  But, as I continue to dive into this flush() path, there are a few other minor updates that need to be done (reference the comments on this JIRA).
