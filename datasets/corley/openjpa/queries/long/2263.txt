I have encountered a situation while creating an openjpa dictionary for teradata. It seems teradata does not like it when the primary key is updated. 

i.e: update tablex set pk=1 where pk=1;

Following the code it seems RowImpl.java contains a method getUpdateSQL which uses the dictionary to various things but it doesn't allow the dictionary to change the statement itself. 

The specific functionality I need here is to only update the pk if the pk has changed or maybe an option not to update the pk at all.
