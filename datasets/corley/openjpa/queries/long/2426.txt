I'm getting very discouraged with OpenJPA as it relates to Postgresql v 9.1 and and creating queries using the LIKE operator.  I know there was an issue a few years back, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-2056, but I've tried everything mentioned there as a workaround to get a simple query like this to work:

Query query = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Patient p where p.lastname = :lastname");
		query.setParameter("lastname", "Silver");		

List<Patient> patients = query.getResultList();

I've tried different property settings in my persistence.xml:

<property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" value="postgres"/>  

and this:

<property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" value="postgres(SearchStringEscape=)"/> 

and even this:

<property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" value="postgresRequiresSearchStringEscapeForLike=false)"/> 

Nothing works. I'm not even convinced Aries JPA, the environment I'm running in under Karaf, even recognizes these property settings.

When I use Hibernate as my persistence provider, I don't have this problem.  I don't want to give up on OpenJPA in my OSGi environment, but I may have to if no one has a solution.
