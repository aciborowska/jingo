This task is to map new features/functionality provided by JPA 2.0 to functionality already provided by OpenJPA extensions.  For example, mapping the OpenJPA cache to the Cache interface defined by JPA 2.0.   Some functions may map fairly well to existing extensions while others may need additional work.  The most current draft of JSR-317 (http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/edr/jsr317/) should be used when making evaluations.  Comments/attachments should indicate the version of the spec used when doing the evaluation.  This mapping can be done piecemeal and then pulled together to form a comprehensive list/evaluation.
