From the parent Issue (OPENJPA-61)...

"I don't think that we want this to necessarily be the default ManagedRuntime implementation, since the TSR does not provide any support for executing work in a separate transaction. This behavior is required for sequence maintenance in some scenarios.

Maybe we should change our ManagedRuntime interface to get rid of the begin() / commit() etc. APIs, and add a new interface for executing a Runnable in a different transaction. This would allow us to use the TSR ManagedRuntime for general use, and just plug in different ways of performing out-of-transaction work." 

Since the original OPENJPA-61 Issue resolved the first problem with a missing TSR implementation, I created this new sub-task for the "out of transaction" work requests.
