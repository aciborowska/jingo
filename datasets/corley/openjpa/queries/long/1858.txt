Currently in BrokerImpl anytime a reference to the MetaDataRepository is needed we call to the configuration to give us a reference. This could be streamlined and BrokerImpl could hold onto a reference. 

Since the Broker is serializeable the ref will need to be transient, but it is straight forward to handle.
