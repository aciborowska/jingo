Two of the tests that I recently enabled via the parent JIRA (openjpa-1443) required a feature of the configuration properties that does not seem to be present in OpenJPA.  After talking with Patrick, it sounds like Kodo has this capability, but it wasn't contributed to OpenJPA.  Or, at least, that's how it looks...

As an example, CacheTest, TestSJVMCache and TestDataCachePCDataGenerator expected the following configuration to create multiple DataCaches...

<property name="DataCache" value="true, true(Name=xxx), true(Name=yyy)"/>

Attempting to run these tests on trunk and 1.2.x resulted in the following error message:

org.apache.openjpa.persistence.PersistenceException: Instantiation of plugin "DataCache" with value "true, true" caused an error "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: true, true". The alias or class name may have been misspelled, or the class may not have be available in the class path. Valid aliases for this plugin are: [concurrent, false, true]

According to Patrick, this plurality capability should be applicable to all plugin configuration properties.  So, when we fix this, we should do a general fix, not specific to the openjpa.DataCache property.

When this JIRA gets resolved, we should re-enable the sections of test code in CacheTest, TestSJVMCache and TestDataCachePCDataGenerator.  The following comment in these tests highlights the area in setup(), but this plurality feature was used in several locations in these tests...

        /*

	OpenJPA does not seem to support plural configuration properties.  (Although it seems
	that Kodo does...)  Until OpenJPA is updated to support this multiple configuration
	setting, the following configuration item will be disabled...
	
	Specifically, this type of configuration is currently not allowed...
	<property name="openjpa.DataCache" value="true, true(Name=xxx)"/>
         */
