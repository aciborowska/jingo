A request for query support over multi-valued elements within XML column has been posted on the user mailing list [1]. We currently support only queries over single-valued elements.

I have investigated the matter a bit using MySQL. It seems that a query working correctly over multi-valued elements can be constructed like this ("street" is multi-valued):

select * from TORDER t0 where ExtractValue(t0.shipAddress,'count(/*/street[text()="Lelevela"]) >= 1') = 1;
or
select * from TORDER t0 where ExtractValue(t0.shipAddress,'count(/*/street[text()="Lelevela"])') >= 1;

What worries me is that such a query might not be indexable even if the database supports indexes over expressions.
