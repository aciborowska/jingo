It is possible to write an object with a Map field declared like so:

    @ManyToMany
    private Map<AllFieldTypes,AllFieldTypes> map =
        new HashMap<AllFieldTypes,AllFieldTypes>();


This should not be possible; instead, we should require @PersistentMap usage, since the behavior above is not spec-compliant.

    @PersistentMap
    private Map<AllFieldTypes,AllFieldTypes> map =
        new HashMap<AllFieldTypes,AllFieldTypes>();

Or, if we decide to support @ManyToMany usage, we must review the code in the PersistenceMetaDataParsers to make sure that we're doing the right things, especially with keys. It looks like @ManyToMany and @PersistentMap are handled very differently in that code.
