I have a working app that uses inline JPQL queries presently.  I decided to try converting one of them to an inline query, to see if that would make it slightly more efficient.

When I converted the single query to a named query, I found that the resulting SQL seemed to ignore the mapping specified in the orm.xml, resulting in invalid table/column references.

Even odder, if I change the test case to first call the inline query, and then immediately call the named query, the named query works fine.

I'm going to attach the "TEST" output from my unit test, showing the invalid SQL, along with a zipped Eclipse project that will demonstrate the problem when the unit tests are run.
