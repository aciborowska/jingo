I receive the following exception if I have an Entity with a One(Many)ToMany relationship with another Entity. 

<openjpa-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-r422266:805588 fatal user error> org.apache.openjpa.persistence.ArgumentException: You have supplied columns for "....Entity", but this mapping cannot have columns in this context.

To recreate the failure, add a @JoinColumn annotation to one of the *ToMany relationships in org.apache.openjpa.persistence.jdbc.annotations.AnnoTest1. 
example:
    @MapKey(name = "basic")
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "oneManyOwner")
    @JoinColumn(name = "asdf")
    protected Map<String, AnnoTest2> inverseOwnerMapKey = new HashMap();

Then run:
trunk\openjpa-parent\openjpa-persistence-jdbc>mvn test -Dtest=org.apache.openjpa.persistence.jdbc.annotations.TestOneToMany
