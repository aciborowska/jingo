JPA 2.0 specifies canonical memtamodel classes for persistent entities. Currently this generation process is uncontrolled. 
Every time the compiler is invoked with 

    $ java -processor openjpa.AnnotationProcessor6  my.PObject

we generate my.PObject_.java. 

We should be able to control this process. In fact, current limitation of being non-selective stops us from activating the service discovery mechanism. 

One suggestion (by Jeremy) is to add a annotation attribute in the @Entity class.
Another suggestion (by Albert) is to bring this generation process closer to PCEnhancer.

Can we also make use of the has @Generated annotation timestamp in PObject_.java to make some decisions?
