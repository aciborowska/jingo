The problem occurs when trying to install axiom-impl (or axiom-dom) from within a karaf-feature

<feature name="axiom-test" version="1.0.0-SNAPSHOT">
        <!-- possible that other bundles are needed here, this is just an example -->
        <bundle>mvn:org.apache.ws.commons.axiom/axiom-api/1.2.13</bundle>
        <bundle>mvn:org.apache.ws.commons.axiom/axiom-dom/1.2.13</bundle>
        <bundle>mvn:org.apache.ws.commons.axiom/axiom-impl/1.2.13</bundle>
</feature>

Typeing "feature:install axiom-test" from within karaf will give the following error:
"Error executing command: Manifest not present in the first entry of the zip mvn:org.apache.ws.commons.axiom/axiom-impl/1.2.13"

OpenJPA had the same issue and has solved it: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-1737

"This issue only shows up when you do a features:install because the
features service is looking at the MANIFEST.MF right upfront to
determine if it needs to install the bundle or if there's already a
suitable bundle available in the container." â€“ http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/karaf-user/201106.mbox/%3CBANLkTim7gVYOWqwaZRYUFOOHcJ0La2Y8iA@mail.gmail.com%3E
