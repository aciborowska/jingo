Our H2Dictionary currently sets LIMIT 0 OFFSET 3 when a Query#setFirstResult(3) is set without any setMaxResults. 
This results in zero entries in the result list.
When I set {{LIMIT -1}, then all works fine.

According to the h2database documentation at http://h2database.com/html/grammar.html we can assume the followint:
LIMIT and FETCH FIRST/NEXT ROW(S) ONLY limits the number of rows returned by the query (no limit if null or smaller than zero). OFFSET specified how many rows to skip

If I read this correctly then we can skip the whole LIMIT clause if no setMaxResults was set.
