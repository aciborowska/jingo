Dear Mr dwood 

                  I am using WASCE (wasce_setup-2.1.1.1-win) i am getting problem when i deploy ear 

1645547   EJBJPA   INFO    [ejbd 3] openjpa.Enhance - Creating subclass for "[class com.pril.rxl.entities.CustomerOrderTaxLineItem, class com.pril.rxl.entities.CustomerOrderLineItem, class com.pril.rxl.entities.RetailTransactionType, class com.pril.rxl.entities.TenderClass, class com.pril.rxl.entities.CustomerOrderAdditionalChargeLineItem, class com.pril.rxl.entities.Worker, class com.pril.rxl.entities.TransactionTotalType, class com.pril.rxl.entities.VendorPaymentTerm, class com.pril.rxl.entities.CustomerOrderDiscountLineItem, class com.pril.rxl.entities.CustomerOrder, class com.pril.rxl.entities.RetailTransaction, class com.pril.rxl.entities.CustomerAccountCardPoint, class com.pril.rxl.entities.Workstation, class com.pril.rxl.entities.VoidTransaction]". This means that your application will be less efficient and will consume more memory than it would if you ran the OpenJPA enhancer. Additionally, lazy loading will not be available for one-to-one and many-to-one persistent attributes in types using field access; they will be loaded eagerly instead. 


     can u tell me exact solution for this ? 

 When i am calling then it displaying message com.pril.rxl.entities.CustomerOrderLineItem   not resolved 

even suggest me exact version of WASCE on which i can deploy my application 

Waiting for reply
