When parsing JPQL, JPQLExpressionBuilder.getPathOrConstant() tries to determine if a token is a java class or enum by doing a class load (via QueryImpl.classForName()). The same token will be tried as often as it appears in the query. It might be better to

1) cache the results
2) avoid the lookup if the token is a known variable name
