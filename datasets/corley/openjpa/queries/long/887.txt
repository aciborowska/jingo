There is a small but quite nasty oversight in TestLibService class:

assertNotNull("could not find the reference from " + bName + "'s volunteer status back to " + bName, volunteer.getBorrower() == borrower);

I suspect the intention was to have assertTrue(...).  The above compiles because of autoboxing creating a Boolean but the assertion is always true, even if volunteer.getBorrower() != borrower.
