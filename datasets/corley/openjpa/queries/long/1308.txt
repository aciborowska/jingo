Using DB2, when a user uses the UPPER or LOWER function, the field is automatically CAST to a varchar.  It would be nice if OpenJPA were a little smarter and only used CAST when necessary.  Using the CAST causes any indexes not to be used so performance won't be what it should.

I saw some other DB2 functions that also are always CAST, so we may need to improve these also.
