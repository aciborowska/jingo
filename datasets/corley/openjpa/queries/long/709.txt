An unique constraint name contains "uk_" prefix and combination of field's names. In case two or more tables have unique constraints with the same combination of fields, the generation of database's schema will fail, because constraint name should be unique too.

It will be very nice if next versions of JPA specification will include possibility to set name for particular constraint.
