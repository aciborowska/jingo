I use a customizer class that extends the PropertiesReverseCustomizer to set the EnumValueHandler with storeOrdinal set to "false" for all fields with enum types. Due to an error in the AnnotationPersistenceMappingSerializer the reverse mapping does not generate the expected @Enumerated annotation.

I forked the repository and commited a bug fix, but I am not able to create a pull request because nothing happens if I click on the button "Create pull request". Instead I included a screenshot of the change. You can also find my fork here: https://github.com/trettstadtnlb/openjpa
