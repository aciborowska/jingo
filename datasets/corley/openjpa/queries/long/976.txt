A new requiresSearchStringEscapeForLike field was added to the DBDictionary in http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-975.  Currently, the default is true and the OracleDictionary overwrites it to false.  Need to investigate other DB's to see what other dictionaries would be better off as false..
