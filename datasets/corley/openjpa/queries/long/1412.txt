I have built an Eclipse plug-in which allows a user to run the OpenJPA Bytecode Enhancer as a project builder.

Other functions than enhancement which make sense in Eclipse, e.g. schema generation, could be added in the future.

The thing works, and has been already undergone some performance testing to try to be optimal.

The initial contribution will not yet have headless build scripts, but I or a friend of mine may contribute this later based on the new Maven3+Tycho. It does have however an easy one click Eclipse update-site generation thingie which may be enough very short term: in a PDE, just open the site.xml in openjpa-updatesite and click "Build All".
