Hello.
I'm still french, so excuse my english again.

I have a problem while trying to persist a very simple object, within a web application.
With a web form I create an object, and then the web app try to persist it.

The EntityManager is loaded for the first object I have to persist, not at the loading of the server, but only when I first try to persist an object. (For the other objects, the EntityManager will be loaded yet).

I have just a message with a number and a text.
My Message class is :

@Entity
@Inheritance (strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
@Table(name = "MESG")
@Id
@Column(name = "NUM_MESG", nullable = false, length = 10)
@Basic
@Column(name = "TXT_MESG", nullable = false, length = 60)

The class is listed in the first Persistence Unit of the persistence.xml, and the xml file is in the right repertory, with the right properties to connect the base, and there is a right database access - library. The Entitymanager is created and can access the base.
The table is created, but when I send an object to the EntityManager, it fails, because :

Attempt to cast instance "2 [mesobjets.Message]" to PersistenceCapable failed.  Ensure that it has been enhanced.


I tried to launch the server whith -the javaagent argument, but the launching fail, because :

FATAL ERROR in native method: processing of -javaagent failed

Is there a system property to set in order to the server find the openjpa library to enhance the classes ?

So, if someone know how to auto-enhance on a server, I'm waiting for their ideas, and i'm still trying to solve the problem. Thanks for your help
