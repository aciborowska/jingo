Currently the distributed join can not be made. This feature aims at relaxing this restriction in a limited way. 
Approaching the complete problem in a step by step manner, the current relaxation will allow to include a "where"
clause in a distributed query, i.e whose object graph may be distributed among different slices.

Currently only "and" as condition connector and ">" as operator will be provided.
