OpenJPA always invoked Datasource.getConnection(String username, String password) , - and defaults username and password to "root" where they are not configured via ConnectionUserName and ConnectionPassword. Datasource.getConnection() with no params is never called. 

Username and Password can be set in the JDBC connection URLs for most databases, so should not be defaulted. In this case getConnection() should probably be called 

Eg. In MySQL:
jdbc:mysql://localhost/testdb?user=testuser&password=testpassord

It is also possible to set the connection username and password in the JDBC URL 

We have a scenario where our customer configures a JDBC URL via a UI. To cut down on configuration and simplify configuration for the customer we only have a URL field (no username/password). Username and password is configured in the URL (with examples given).

To make it work we had to  configure a custom datasource via "openjpa.ConnectionFactory" and override Datasource.getConnection(String username, String password)  and invoke getConnection() therein with no params.
