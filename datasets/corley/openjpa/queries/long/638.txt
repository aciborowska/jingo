PostgreSQL can store objects in its native timestamp in a format determined by PostgreSQL build options. By default, the postgresql timestamp is a double-precision floating-point number with maximum precision of 6 digits (see section 8.4 of the PostgreSQL 8.2.7 documentation). java.sql.Timestamp extends java.util.Date, and thus stores data in long integer milliseconds. The resulting value mismatch can cause optimistic updates to fail.
