The DB2Dictionary class behaves significantly differently when connected to Z/OS or iSeries (there are further differences for version numbers). As a result the class is becoming tough to read and maintain.

It'd be easier to create separate classes for the unique platforms (Z and I series), in the past we didn't do this since we wouldn't be able to detect the type of dictionary without obtaining a connection - now that there are significant differences I think the benefit of out weighs the cost.
