In our application, we processing XML's containing Unicode characters and mapping their values to entities. Post that, we are persisting the entities to the database.

When we persist the data to the database,  garbage value is persisted (i.e.  ������������������������������������������������������������������arrow keys) 


We are using DB2 as the database in which the data-source is configured in our application using JNDI as well as J2SE.

What can we do to persist data that supports Unicode encoding?
