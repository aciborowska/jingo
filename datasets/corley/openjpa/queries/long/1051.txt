 In  OpenJPA implementation, it looks that MappingDefaultsImpl.populateColumns can accept multiple columns 
 because it has Column[] signature.
 If column name is longer than DBDictionary restriction (it's very short in some databases. 
 For example, oracle max name length is 32), names are truncated. 

 Because name conflict is detected based on actual Table info,given Column[] data does not get checked. 
 So, if given Column[] have very long name and truncated name of these Column[] is conflicted, 
 it could not be detected.
