It's hard for me to reproduce, but wanted to post a bug, to slowly build any evidence we can find to fix this bug.

I used to do lots of em.getReference (because I got confused, and used that instead fo em.find).  In non-slice code, it worked perfectly fine.  But when I used slices, it would fail, but not in a very predictable/reproducable manner.  let me try to explain.  Here is some code that failed for me:

Team team = em.getReference( teamId );
String name = team.getFullName();

I would get a reference to the Team object.  And even at the next line, when I tried to access a field from that object, it would throw an exception, complaining that the object did not exist any longer.  For some reason it did not find the object.  So I tried this:

Team team = em.getReference( teamId );
log().debug( "SLICE: "+SlicePersistence.getSlice( team ) );
String name = team.getFullName();

And it said "SLICE: null".  So my only clue is that the slice was not set properly for references, so that they might fail in a later time..
