Hi Ajay Aggarwal,

I think your query is correct and should work. According to the Java Persistence query language BNF the expression following the keyword SET might be a state_field and state_field includes navigation through an
embedded:
state_field ::= 
{embedded_class_state_field.}
*simple_state_field

I propose you file a JIRA issue.

Regards Michael
