The descirption of Bean Validation mentions:

"Notice the use of the @Valid annotation. ... Referenced entities and collections of entities are validated separately in order to prevent circular validation."

If a referenced entity contains a constraint (e.g. @NotNull) and the owner class which references the entity does not use the @Valid constraint, the entity is validated (which is correct) but does throw a PersistenceException containing a ConstraintViolationException and not directly a ConstraintViolationException. Is this behaviour correct according to the spec?

Futhermore, the embedded entities are validated independent of a @Valid annotation, this is not correct.
