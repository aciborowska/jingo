Hibernate has a naming strategy, org.hibernate.cfg.ImprovedNamingStrategy, that knows how to convert  camel cased Java class names and property names to underscored table and column names and vice versa.  Consequently, if Hibernate can do a  one-to-one mapping, you don't have to necessarily use the @Table and  @Column annotations for everything.  I saw that OpenJPA has a MappingDefaults interface, which looks to offer something like this.

Michael Dick  has said he is not aware of anything built in to OpenJPA that generates underscored names, and it seems like that a variation on the
MappingDefaults.removeHungarianNotation property might be a solution.
