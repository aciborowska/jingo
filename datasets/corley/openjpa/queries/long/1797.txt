A Person entity class, which has such emails field:

@OneToMany(targetEntity = EmailDb.class, mappedBy = "person", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
  protected List<ListField> emails = new ArrayList<ListField>();

While Email entity is subclass of @MappedSuperclass ListFieldDb.

Then I create email and add to person:

EmailDb email = new EmailDb();
email.setValue(targetAddress);
email.setPrimary(false);
email.setType("emailType");

person.addEmail(emial);
em.persist(person);

But what I see from console about email table changes is: INSERT INTO email (oid, person_id) VALUES (?, ?), and other data lost, especially the map key 'person_id' to person table.

Not sure if I am using something wrong? or this is a known issue?

I pasted source code files for entity relationship reference. Thanks.
