If OpenJPA is configured to get the DataSource from JNDI and the lookup fails it return meaningless messages.

lookupConnectionFactory(String name, String userKey) in org.apache.openjpa.conf.OpenJPAConfigurationImpl swallows exceptions if a NamingException is thrown during a JNDI lookup.

The effect is, that in createConnectionFactory in org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.conf.JDBCConfigurationImpl, if a ConnectionFactoryName is provided which causes a NamingException, null is returned from getConnectionFactory() and it tries to get the DataSource using JDBC configuration data, what fails, since there aren't any provided. It ends up with a ArgumentException with message: "A JDBC Driver or DataSource class name must be specified in the ConnectionDriverName property." which is totally misleading.

Expected: the provider returns information about the failure to retrieve the DataSource from JNDI. It shouldn't silently fall back to using JDBC properties.
