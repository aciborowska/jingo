Some of the datacache timeout tests fail intermittently, I'm opening a JIRA to track our investigation into removing the timing window, or at least making it less likely. 

Donald has already narrowed the window considerably, and we might not be able to make a significant improvement or remove it entirely, in which case this JIRA can be closed.
