My code relied on the following behavior http://openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.2.0/apache-openjpa/docs/jpa_2.2.html#jpa_2.2_cascadePersist which has been changed in 2.2.0.

I would like to have ability to control this behavior not on entire configuration level, but per-entity level. This would make migration of my code to "2.2.0-pure" state less traumatic.
