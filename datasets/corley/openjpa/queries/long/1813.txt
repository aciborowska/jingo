the following query:

Query query = em.createQuery("select count(d) from Order o, IN(o.deliveryAddress) d where o.createdYmd = CURRENT_DATE and d.deliveryMode = ?1");

generates the following SQL:

SELECT COUNT(t1.oid) FROM orders t0 INNER JOIN address t1 ON t0.oid = t1.order_oid WHERE (t0.createdymd IS NULL AND t1.deliverymode = ?) [params=?]

Why the where part with "IS NULL" ? Current_date should be applied there shouldnt it?
