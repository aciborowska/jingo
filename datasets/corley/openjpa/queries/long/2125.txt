According to JPA v2 specification, two types of relationship use join table to keep relational data: 

	many-to-many described in page 48,
	unidirectional one-to-many described in page 50.



In both cases, the joining table name should be composed from entity names (e.g. class names) by default. OpenJPA uses entity table names by default.

Quote from JPA v2 specification:
"Entity A is mapped to a table named A. 
Entity B is mapped to a table named B. 

There is a join table that is named A_B (owner name first). The join table has ..."


Example entities:
@Entity
@Table(name="tblMtmOwner")
public class MtmOwner {
  @Id
  private long id;
  private String name;
  @ManyToMany
  private Collection<MtmInverse> inverses = new ArrayList<MtmInverse>();
}

@Entity
public class MtmInverse{
  @Id
  private long id;
  @ManyToMany(mappedBy="inverses")
  @MapKey(name="name")
  private Map<String, MtmOwner> owners = new HashMap<String, MtmOwner>();
}

Expected join table name: MtmOwner_MtmInverse
OpenJPA join table name:  tblMtmOwner_MtmInverse
