We currently rely on fix installed versions of various databases.
With the advent of Docker we could use maven profiles to start those databases as docker images.

E.g. 

$> mvn -N -Ptest-mysql-docker docker:start
$> mvn -Ptest-mysql-docker clean install
$> mvn -N -Ptest-mysql-docker docker:stop



The `-N` is needed to start maven Non-Recursive. Otw you might see some nasty log output which does not belong there
