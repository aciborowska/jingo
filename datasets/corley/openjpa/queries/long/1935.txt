Locking type failures are not mapped correctly when using Informix with OpenJPA.  When a SQLException with generic sql state value 'IX000' is returned, it gets mapped to a query exception.  Instead, the underlying SQLException(s) should be inspected for specific lock or lock timeout sql codes to determine the correct exception type.
