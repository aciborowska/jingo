Some use cases require a new database connection to perform operation because the current connection is busy/open.
Typical use case is asking for size of the result set (obtained by a SELECT COUNT query) while the original result set is still being open.

Some databases (e.g. MySQL as per observation) do not allow the new COUNT query on the same connection because the original result set is still open.

A JDBCStore.getNewConnection() is added â€“ but use it with caution, remember to close it and use it only when required.
