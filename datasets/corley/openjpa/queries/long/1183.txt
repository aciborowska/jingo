This umbrella issue will track ergonomic issues of Metamodel generation process.
For example, 
how to  invoke the generation process?
how to control it? 
how to detect whether we need to generate these metamodel classes?
how to identify non-canonical metamodel classes?

Eventually the outcome should be clear user documentation.
