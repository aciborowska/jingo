for some reason, the setUnique method is making sure that it's not ReadOnly..
But I would assume that setUnique is only called for select queries.. so it should only be for read-only queries.. they have nothing to do with update/delete right??


kernel/QueryImpl.java

    public void setUnique(boolean unique) {
        lock();
        try 
{
            assertOpen();
            assertNotReadOnly();
            _unique = (unique) ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE;
        }
 finally 
{
            unlock();
        }
    }
