In my unit tests, I'm using the openjpa.jdbc.SynchronizeMappings feature to have OpenJPA create the schema in an HSQL in-memory database. Two of the tables in my schema each have a unique constraint that lists the same column names (foo,bar) in the same order. The generated name for both constraints is UNQ_foobar. HSQL apparently puts the names of unique constraints into a schema-wide namespace which causes the CREATE TABLE statement for the second table to fail with "constraint already exist".

@Entity
@Table( uniqueConstraints = { @UniqueConstraint( columnNames = 
{ "foo", "bar" } ) } )
public class X {
...
private String foo;
private long bar;
...
}

@Entity
@Table( uniqueConstraints = { @UniqueConstraint( columnNames = { "foo", "bar" }
 ) } )
public class Y 
{
...
private String foo;
private long bar;
...
}

Note that I tweaked my sample code and log trace a little to simplify the test case.

I didn't try to reproduce this with OpenJPA 2.0.0 yet. From looking at the code in the 2.0.0 trunk, I can tell that this part has been rewritten completely and this issue might not apply to 2.0.0. I also don't know whether HSQL is violating the SQL standard by requiring unique constaint names to be schema-unique, not just table-unique.

What works for me as a workaround is to reorder the columns in the constraint on the second table.

Assuming this is not a bug in HSQL and assuming it also reproduces in 2.0.0 beta, I'd naively prefix constraint names with the table name but I'm no specialist in either SQL or JPA ...
