Under optimistic transaction model, OpenJPA detects lock violations a) by checking version stamps b) at commit time.
It is non-trivial to recover from a failure detected at commit time. Hence the proposal is for a lock manager that obtains in-memory locks on object. 
A combination of 
a) Lock objects in Java 5 and 
b) a capability to find other instances that represent the same database record within i) the same JVM or ii) in the same persistent unit 
can be a good starting point for such a feature.
