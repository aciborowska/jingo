Hibernate explicitly defines the behavior of secondary tables. (such as in http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/annotations/api/org/hibernate/annotations/Table.html#fetch())

I checked both the original JPA specification and many implementations and none of them talks about the subject. Hibernate, however, has this in the documentation.

Can you confirm it? It has a lot of side effects, for example:

Can you answer on the implemented behavior and comment on my two examples?

Should this be pointed to JPA specification responsibles?

Thanks,
