Section 3.2.9  of the spec states:

A collection-valued attribute is considered to be loaded if the collection was loaded from the database
or the value of the attribute was assigned by the application, and, if the attribute references a collection
instance (i.e., is not null), each element of the collection (e.g. entity or embeddable) is considered to be
loaded.

OpenJPA currently does not behave according to spec if an entity is loaded by the DB and the collection attribute is set to null.
