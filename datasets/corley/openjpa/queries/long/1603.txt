In doing some testing I have found that there is a valid use case where one would want to use the query results cache (openjpa.QueryCache), but not the DataCache. I'm using this JIRA to remove the dependency between these two caches.

The gist of this change is that the QueryCache will now talk with the StoreContext to see if the results of a cached query are contained in the L1 cache OR by any of the DelegatingStoreManager's cache. The default JDBCStoreManager and the XMLStoreManager both do not have any concept of a cache and will always not have any cached results.
