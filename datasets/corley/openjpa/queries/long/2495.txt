In a Java EE environment, when specifying a validation group using the "javax.persistence.validation.group.group.pre-persist" (or pre-update or pre-delete) causes a "Could not create the optional validation provider" because it cannot find the class for the validation group.  The problem appears to be that the code to find the class (org.apache.openjpa.persistence.validation.ValidationImpl.getValidationGroup) is using Class.forName(className) and not using the application's context class loader.
