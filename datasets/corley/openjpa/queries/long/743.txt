Persisting an object graph with an entity containing a persistent collection of objects which contain a Lob field may fail on Oracle if statement batching is enabled.  The failure will depend on the order of operations, which can be somewhat intermittent.  If more than one insert into the table containing the Lob column are batched together and there is a mix of null and non-null data value parameters, the batch insert operation will fail with an OptimisticLockException.  

A simple (but not especially performance friendly) way to work around the problem is to disable statement batching via: 
<property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" value="oracle(batchLimit=0)"/>  Otherwise, if possible, make sure all Lob fields are set to a non-null value.
