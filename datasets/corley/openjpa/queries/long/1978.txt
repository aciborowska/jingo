We got a MappedSuperclass A with IdClass APK. The class B extends A using inheritance type 'TAPE_PER_CLASS'. 
The class C holds a field of type A. OpenJPA crashes with a NullPointerException in org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.meta.MappingInfo#mergeColumn. 

We tried different annotation strategies to tackle this problem but didn't find a way to get rid of the NullPointerException. While looking at the bug database we found a lot of issues that might be related to this problem but weren't able to track down the cause of the error.

I will attach a stacktrace and a maven project containing a testcase for the above scenario reproducing the error.
