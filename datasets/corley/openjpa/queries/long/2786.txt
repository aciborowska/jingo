There is a Lifecycle Event Listener interface called UpdateListener, which is similar to PersistListener, LoadListener, StoreListener, etc. If a listener that implements this interface is registered (through LifecycleEventManager.addListener) the methods are not invoked.

This appears to be because org.apache.openjpa.event.LifecycleEventManager.ListenerList#getEventTypes is missing the following logic:

if (listener instanceof UpdateListener) {
  types |= 2 << LifecycleEvent.BEFORE_UPDATE;
  types |= 2 << LifecycleEvent.AFTER_UPDATE_PERFORMED;
}

Additionally, the LifecycleListener interface, which claims to contain all listeners, does not extend UpdateListener.
