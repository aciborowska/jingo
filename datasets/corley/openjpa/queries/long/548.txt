The example from OpenJPA documentation "Example 3.1.  Interaction of Interfaces Outside Container" does not compile.

The following line is wrong:

// get an EntityManager from the factory
EntityManager em = factory.createEntityManager(PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED);

It's a good idea to be clear in the OpenJPA documentation:

 The only way to obtain EntityManager with transaction persistence context is to use these injected by the container.

 There are two ways to obtain EntityManager with extended persistence context within container:

	by factory, by invoking createEntityManager()
	injected within Stateful Session Bean with following annotation:
               @PersistenceContext(type=EXTENDED)
               EntityManager em;
