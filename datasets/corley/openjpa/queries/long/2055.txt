UUIDGenerator class uses an IPv4 address as part of its seed when generating a UUID.  That is, the UUIDGenerator makes a call to InteAddress 'getAddress' method to get the address and assumes it returns a byte array of size 4 (the size of an IPv4 address).  However, in an environment which uses IPv6, 'getAddress' can return a byte array of length 16.  UUIDGenerator needs to be updated to account for an IPv6 address.
