OpenJPA should be able to see and access schemas but doesn't. 

I configured this with openjpa.jdbc.Schema=DEV (my schema name) 

I also tried putting the schema name everywhere possible in the metadata, i.e. in the <schema>DEV</schema> tags and in table tags, and in:

  <persistence-unit-metadata>
    <xml-mapping-metadata-complete />
    <persistence-unit-defaults>
      <schema>DEV</schema>
    </persistence-unit-defaults>
  </persistence-unit-metadata>

I will include a zipped up test project illustrating the problem.
