In PostgresDictionary.java, Line 430 calls buildNames(strName) to get a String[][]. Right below this, a for loop references namePairs.length. However, buildNames can return null, which results in a NullPointerException. While this is inside a try/catch, it still fills my logs up with warning messages (10 stack traces at launch for a single table with a sequence). Skipping the loop when namePairs is null would solve this.
