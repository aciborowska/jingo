OpenJPA configures EntityManagerFactory at creation time via an instance of Configuartion object. Once EntityManagerFactory is created and a EntityManager is issued from it â€“ the Configuration is frozen by design. That is no further changes to Configuration is allowed as long as EntityManagerFactory lives.

For certain configuration properties, it is desirable to change them during the lifetime of a EntityManagerFactory.
This issue is raised to initiate a discussion on such a feature, the possibility and limitations of dynamic update and track the impact of such a change as frozen Configuration is an important assumption.
