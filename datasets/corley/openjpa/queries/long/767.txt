The ability to use OpenJPA in an OSGi "container" environment is a desired feature.  Basically, OSGi could provide the "container" aspect of the Java EE environment.  This would be beyond the basic JSE application-managed persistence context support.  And, it's not quite the same as the defined Java EE container-managed persistence context support.  It's similar though.

We can use this feature to document items that come along from this exercise.  To start with, I will probably create a separate branch/sandbox for experimentation.  Once we get a better handle on the extent of the changes, then we will need to merge any necessary changes into the appropriate supported branch or trunk.
