Entities using GeneratedValue for primary key, a version field an dno detached state fails to merge.

The issue lies with identifying :"what makes a new instance?"

It is not obvious why VersionAttachStrategy does not use version field to detect newness. Instead it depends on detached state which is obviously null for instances not using a Detached State.

Can someone shade some light on why VersionAttachStrategy ignores version field to detect newness?
