The web application uses a JoinTable to store user roles. It has a screen to assign/remove user roles.
At unpredictable times when the user is using the tool intermittently logging out and logging in, all the role records from the JoinTable get deleted on their own.
We have enable SQL trace to see the sequence in which the deletion happens, and are certain that this user role deletion is not user initiated.
Please let me know how this issue can be resolved.
