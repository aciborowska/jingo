When specifying a custom sequence to use via the @SequenceGenerator annotation, the class name specified in the sequenceName field must have open and close parentheses at the end of it. If no parentheses are present, OpenJPA assumes that the sequence name is the name of a sequence in the database, not a classname to use.
