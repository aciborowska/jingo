Adding JDBC 4 methods to classes like DelegatingPreparedStatement and DelegatingConnection will allow OpenJPA using JDBC 4 features. Also, users who obtain a connection from OpenJPA will not be required to get "the innermost delegate" to call JDBC 4 methods on the connection.

Two other related tasks to be addressed here:

	Make some JDBC 3 calls real delegates instead of throwing UnsupportedOperationException.
	Replace reflected JDBC 3 calls with direct ones.
