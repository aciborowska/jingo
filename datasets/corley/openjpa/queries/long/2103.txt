In a schema with a cascading association with a foreign key, I'm having strange effects where the SQL statements generated on em.flush() somtimes appear in the wrong order.

I've reduced this to a funny case where a passing test starts failing, as soon as it is preceded by em.flush():

    @Test
    public void testFlushFailure() 
{
        em.flush();
        testFlushOk();
    }


The same tests both pass on Hibernate. I'm attaching a self-contained Maven Project to demonstrate the issue.
