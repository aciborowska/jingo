Updating an entity (EntityA) by setting a new embeddable to it when the embeddable has a relationship with another entity (EntityB) with cascade delete does not work:

(1) the old entityB referenced by the old embeddable in EntityA will be deleted.
(2) if the EntityB also has cascade delete relation with EntityA, the EntityA will also be deleted,
