Using the following annotation:

   @OneToMany(mappedBy="root", fetch=FetchType.LAZY)
    @OrderBy("objectId ASC")
    private List<Message> messages;

I get the exception "Cannot order "net.spatula.tally_ho.model.MessageRoot.messages" on "objectId", because that field is not in the default fetch group.  You can only order on fields that will be selected when the related object is loaded."

I should certainly hope that the primary key of the related object is going to be selected when the object is loaded:

    @Id
    @Column(name = "object_id")
    private long objectId;
