Per the discussion on our forums [1], there seems to some consistent issues with how we perform detachment processing of the mutable types such as Date, Timestamp, etc.  There seems to be a couple of issues (at least)...

o  Detachment processing is not consistent between the detach() method and the clear() method.
o  Tracking of changes on a detached entity, but still allow it to be serialized without requiring the openjpa jar file.
