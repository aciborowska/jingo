The current development of JPA 2.0 features is based on JPA 2.0 Specification published mid-March 2009. Since then, the specification has evolved in major way. However, no public draft version of the specification is available or planned in near future. Several strategic and logistical steps will be taken to narrow the gap between ongoing implementation and the current version of the unpublished spec. 

1. The latest spec API to repository will be checked-in as 1.0-EA3-SNAPSHOT 
2. Build dependency will be updated to this latest version.
3 The implementation will be refactored to the latest spec version. This refactored implementation merely compiles and is not validated by tests.
4. CriteriaQuery and MetaModel tests are deactivated till the spec API stabilizes. Because the query result processing is going through serious churn. Hence, any effort to reorient and validate 200+ tests against a meta-stable API has little value at this point. 
5. Given the rather long names of some of the new API and their generic type argument list, the existing line length limit of 80 will be relaxed to 120 for better readability.
