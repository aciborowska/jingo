As an OpenJPA user I find that the PCEnhancer is sometimes overly verbose. I would like to know when problems or suspected problems are encountered, but I don't want to know when everything is working fine. There are two INFO messages that are particularly noisy. The first noisy message is logged every time enhancement starts on a given class [1] and the second message is logged when a classes is already enhanced [2].

I'm going to change these two INFO messages to TRACE messages because end users don't care about them a large majority of the time. I didn't remove these messages entirely because someone supporting OpenJPA may still need the information.

[1]  Enhancing type "
{0}" loaded by {1}.
[2]  Type "{0}
" loaded by 
{1}
 is already persistence capable; skipping.
