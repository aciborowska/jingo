Oracle's TimesTen is a high-performance DB used extensively in various industries such as telecom and defense.
So far, Toplink Essentials and Hibernate provide TimesTen support, but Toplink's support is poor, and the product itself is not as flexible as OpenJPA. Hibernate, on the other hand, is often too heavy for applications making use of TimesTen, which are often soft-realtime with memory limitations. 
OpenJPA seems to be the perfect choice for JPA on top of TimesTen.

Since TimesTen is an Oracle product, its SQL dialect is very much like Oracle's but with a few differences. 
It would be great to have a TimesTenDictionary.
