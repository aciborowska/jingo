When javax.persistence.lock.timeout is set to zero or the lock takes longer than specified then LockTimeoutException should be thrown, however PessimisticLockException is thrown.

From the spec:
The length of time in milliseconds the persistence provider should wait to obtain a lock on the database tables may be specified using the javax.persistence.lock.timeout property. If the time it takes to obtain a lock exceeds the value of this property, a LockTimeoutException will be thrown, but the current transaction will not be marked for rollback. If this property is set to 0, the persistence provider should throw a LockTimeoutException if it cannot immediately obtain a lock.
