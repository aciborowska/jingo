By default, Sybase silently truncates a string which is longer than the column length without raising an exception. To override this behavior, string_rtruncation must be set on. In order to be consistent with other databases (which raise exceptions when a string length is longer than the column length), we will set string_rtruncation on by default for Sybase. For an application that wants to keep Sybase silent truncation behavior, a DBDictionary property "setStringRightTruncationOn" is introduced. When it is set to false in the persistence.xml, the string will be silently truncated during insert/update.
