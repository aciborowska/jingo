Normally, em.merge() is invoked on graphs of detached or unmanaged instances. However, it is common to obtain a detached or unmanaged instance and add relations to managed instances.

It seems clear that these sorts of detached-and-managed graphs can be handled in a deterministic manner by OpenJPA. So, we should do so.
