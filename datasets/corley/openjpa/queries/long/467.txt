The Ant enhancer task requires a persistence.xml file in order to function correctly.  It needs this even if there is no useful information in it (the list of classes to enhance is provided separately and the database settings are irrelevant).

You can't use the persistence.xml that will be deployed with the persistence unit because it may refer to a JAR file that has not been built yet (because the classes have to be enhanced before being packaged).  So you have to create a separate persistence.xml just for the build step.

The task should function even if no persistence.xml is available.  Perhaps it would also be useful to be able to optionally specify properties as nested elements in the build.xml rather than in persistence.xml.
