Currently, in the persistence context, one can define:

<property name="openjpa.jdbc.SynchronizeMappings" value="buildSchema" />

Which causes OpenJPA to build the database schema based on the mapping defined. Currently, there is no way to define it to drop tables if they exists before creating the database schema. This is very useful for tests that drop (if exists) and creates new tables for each test.
