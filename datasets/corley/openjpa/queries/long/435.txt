OpenJPA's current defaults assume that no foreign keys exist. This leads to potentially more optimal SQL ordering, but often also leads to FK constraint violations when obvious FKs exist but are not declared. We should change this default to be more user-friendly, and add a note to our optimization guide as appropriate if there are actions users should take to optimize.
