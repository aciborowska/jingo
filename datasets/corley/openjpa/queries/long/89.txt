When executing the statement 

em.createQuery("delete from Subject").executeUpdate();

where Subject is in a many-to-many relationship with Book, and Subject owns the relationship, one expects that the corresponding entry in the SUBJECT_BOOK table would be deleted.  This happens when bulk deleting one-to-many relationships that are mapped with a join table, as well as for *-to-one relationships mapped with a foreign key.  It also happens when individually deleting objects.  However, it does not happen when bulk deleting the owning side of a many-to-many relationship.
