Auditing or change tracking is an important function for transactional systems. 
We have sufficient support to build a facility that will allow the user to mark an entity @Auditable and an AuditManager to capture the changes in a transaction for @Audiatble instance via existing callbacks. 
Such an AuditManager should be configurable for the user to decide where the audit information being persisted (could be the same database, a separate database or something entirely different such as JMS queue or a file (or a printer, as someone had suggested).
