Some configuration options are misleading and dangerous if the datasource JNDI location is provided at EntityManager creation time. For example the L2 cache can not be reliably used if each EntityManager may be communicating with a different schema / database instance. 

In order to prevent confusion down the road we should throw an exception when these conditions are detected.
