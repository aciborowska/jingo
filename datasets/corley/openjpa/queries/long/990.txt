JPA2 public draft spec section 3.6.1 Query Interface notes that Query.setHint() should throw a IllegalArgumentException if a supplied hint value is not valid for a given implementation.
For lock/query timeout, any user supplied value < -1 is invalid and should throw an exception, which is not occurring.
