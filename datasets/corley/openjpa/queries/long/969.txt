The openjpa manual states clearly that a second unmanaged DataSource is required for updating sequence table (page 205: 4.2.1. Managed and XA DataSources): 

"When using a managed DataSource, you should also configure a second unmanaged DataSource that OpenJPA can use to perform tasks that are independent of the global transaction. The most common of these tasks is updating the sequence table OpenJPA uses to generate unique primary key values for your datastore identity objects. Configure the second DataSource using the non-jta-data-source persistence.xml element, or OpenJPA's various "2" connection properties, such as openjpa.ConnectionFactory2Name or openjpa.Connection2DriverName. These properties are outlined in
Chapter 2, Configuration [161]."

Openjpa, however, does not this rule when Sequence table is involved. As a result, the application hangs when only one datasource is configured. This is not very user-friendly. An error message should be thrown when this situation is detected.
