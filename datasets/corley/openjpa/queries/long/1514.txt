Although a DBDictionary instance by definition has access to the database's information that would allow it to mark a new Column as being autoassigned, DBDictionaries do not do this in their newColumn() method.  It seems to me that all DBDictinonary instances should be required by contract to detect when a column is a database-managed identity or sequential column and should call Column#setAutoAssigned(boolean) as appropriate.
