Generally-speaking, OpenJPA generates the SQL needed to load records from the database. Currently, the only mainstream exception to this is when using SQL as a query language.

In legacy environments, database access is often limited to certain SQL statements or stored procedures. OpenJPA should support such environments for a larger subset of OpenJPA operations.
