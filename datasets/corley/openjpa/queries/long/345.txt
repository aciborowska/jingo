The "openjpa" module of the maven project (e.g., the one available from http://www.ibiblio.org/maven2/org/apache/openjpa/openjpa/1.0.0/ ) is an aggregate jar of all the other openjpa modules. For build reasons, this module has a dependency on all the other openjpa modules. However, the practical consequence is that when another project has a dependency on "openjpa", jars from all the other modules are downloaded and added as dependencies. So rather than just downloading the one "openjpa-1.0.0.jar" that is needed, the following additional jars are also downloaded and added as transitive dependencies of the maven project:

openjpa-jdbc-1.0.0.jar
openjpa-jdbc-5-1.0.0.jar
openjpa-kernel-1.0.0.jar
openjpa-kernel-5-1.0.0.jar
openjpa-lib-1.0.0.jar
openjpa-persistence-1.0.0.jar
openjpa-persistence-jdbc-1.0.0.jar
openjpa-xmlstore-1.0.0.jar

One solution might be to change the dependency type in the "openjpa" module to be "system", but we would need to investigate the consequences of doing this.
