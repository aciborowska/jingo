Three problems discovered with the examples:
1) the openjpa-examples build was trying to use both the openjpa.jar and openjpa-all.jar files in the binary distribution
2) the examples directory in the binary.zip didn't have a README for the examples
3) the openjpa-integration/examples/pom.xml was not looking in the right location for the binary.zip file to extract
