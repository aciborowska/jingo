For "people like me" (users who like to look around the OpenJPA source code without actually checking it out from SVN...), it would be "very nice" (needed!) if whoever maintains the Maven build infrastructure on your end could finally make it so that those openjpa*-sources.jar get built & published correctly...

In v1.2.0 the openjpa-1.2.0.jar was "bloated" (11.1 mb) and contained .class and .java (bad). In v1.2.1 & v2.0.0-M3 the normal JAR is smaller (2.9mb resp. 3.7mb) and there is an openjpa*-sources.jar (openjpa-1.2.1-sources.jar & openjpa-2.0.0-M3-sources.jar) BUT they are "almost empty" (11 kb, useless; contains only Manifest.mf & LICENSE.txt & NOTICE.txt). For v1.2.2-SNAPSHOT there does not seem to be a openjpa-1.2.2-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar.

Please?
