This issue was originally raised on the user's mailing list at http://n2.nabble.com/EntityNotFoundException-caused-by-EntityManager-refresh-td4901557.html#a4901557. 

If you have a toMany relationship and are cascading the REFRESH operation an EntityNotFondException may occur if any of the rows on the toMany side have been deleted. 

Finding which rows didn't exist is a bit tricky. You'll need go through two sets of nested exceptions to get to the rows that were deleted, and then you only get the primary keys, not the table / entity name.

We should add the table name / entity name to the message if possible and promote them to the higher level exception.
