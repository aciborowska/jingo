There is no way to use a custom CodeFormat if you want the ReverseMapping tool to write out annotations for you.

This is because CodeGenerator.java either uses your supplied "class code" (the template you supply) or figures out its own.  If you supply one, no call is ever made to writeAnnotations().  It is only when you don't supply your own "class code" that the generator calls writeAnnotations().

The reason I'm encountering this is because of another bug, whose number I'll put in here once I create it.
