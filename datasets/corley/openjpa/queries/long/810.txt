This problem was reported on the user mailing list by several users.   It appeared to be an enhancement related problem similar to OPENJPA-234, but I was able to reproduce the problem (using a test app provided by Yann [1] via direct email) with classes that were enhanced with the PCEnhancer.  Based on the trace, it appears that the metadata repository is being accessed concurrently by multiple threads and some persistent classes are not yet loaded while threads attempt to access them.  The problem occurs more frequently when a) the persistent class list is large and b) trace is enabled.
