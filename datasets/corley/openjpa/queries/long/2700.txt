With an in-memory Derby DB, schema generation runs successfully. However, an attempt to persist entities fails with the exception "table not found". It seems as though schema generation and database manipulation were run using separate connections, and the database ceased to exist before DML could be executed. 

When a file-backed Derby is used, the issue no longer persists. 

Sample project attached (mvn exec reproduces the issue; commenting out the line `executeWithPersistenceUnit("in-memory-persistence-unit", Main::insertEntities);` from `Main.java` makes the problem go away).
