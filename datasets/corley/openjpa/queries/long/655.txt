A class-level query filter that applies to all queries implicitly is a useful functionality and available in similar software product [1].

The base functionality is:
a) A class can be annotated with a query

@Entity
@Filter(query="SELECT x FROM PObject x WHERE x.field = f1 AND x.status =! DONE")
public class PObject 
{...}

b) Any query on class PObject will augment the class-level filter predicates. 

c) @Filter query can be parametrized. The parameters can be set on current FetchPlan.


Will attach a draft/prototype for such functionality. Please take a look and let me know your valued comments.
