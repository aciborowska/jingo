If you have a cached entity in the L2 cache and later fetch a LAZY field from the entity it will fetch it from the DB.  However it won't update the cached entity with the lazy field value, which is what I would expect.  It is prefered if the Entity would get updated in L2 cache, so that subsequent calls don't hit the DB again and again.
