When testing the openjpa 3 feature in karaf I had the problem that my table was not there when openjpa tried to access it even though I have specified the options to create tables. 
This first case where I found the issue was using Aries JPA. So I was not sure if the problem might be in Aries JPA.

I have now created a pax exam test that reproduces the issue without Aries JPA.
