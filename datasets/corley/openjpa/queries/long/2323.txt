1) The below code is placed in a Batch Job, which is processing about 100 records every minute. 
2) Recently, this job is split into two, for processing different set of data. 
3) This is causing upto 2000 version updates in the Table, when both the Jobs were invoked parallel. 

Need to know why this is happening? Anyone can advise?
