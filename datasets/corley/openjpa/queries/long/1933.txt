usually an @ElementCollection field loaded from the database will be created as a org.apache.openjpa.java$.util$.ArrayListProxy.

After serialisation/deserialisation (with DetachedStateField=true) the List will be recreated as standard java.util.ArrayList.

This has the bad side effect, that any subsequent add to this ElementCollection will not set the _dirty field in the DetachedStateManager and any changes in the ElementCollection will not get saved to the database.
