JPA2 spec section 9.2 states - "If a provider does not qualify as the provider for the named persistence unit, it must return null when createEntityManagerFactory is invoked on it."
But OpenJPA is throwing exceptions for all failure cases...
For now, we'll keep the 1.x behavior, but may need to revisit this when we start running the JPA2 TCK.
