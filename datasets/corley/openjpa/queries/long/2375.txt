When the MappingTool creates the database schema, OpenJPA will let the database determine the names of primary and foreign key constraints. Microsoft SQL server uses a seemingly random number which changes each time the database schema is generated. This makes it harder to create SQL scripts that refer to these keys or use schema comparison tools.

Names of generated keys could e.g. be:
PK_<table name>
FK_<table name>_<foreign key column name(s)>
