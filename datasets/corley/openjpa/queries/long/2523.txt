I cannot seem to get the evict by OID working.  When I use evict by class that works, but what I really want to do is to just evict a single entity.

Here is my scenario:
1) Bean managed EJB uses a native SQL to modify an Entity.  This does begin & commit.
2) After the commit it makes a call to another EJB, but that call is returning stale data.

I have tried:

OpenJPAEntityManager kem = OpenJPAPersistence.cast(em);
kem.getEntityManagerFactory().getCache().evict(X.class, id);

But that doesn't work, but this works:

OpenJPAEntityManager kem = OpenJPAPersistence.cast(em);
kem.getEntityManagerFactory().getCache().evictAll(X.class);

Am I the only one having issues with evict by ID?
