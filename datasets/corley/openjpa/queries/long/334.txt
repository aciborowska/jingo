Following description is a simplified model of the issue we are facing. 

Assume that we have 2 entities EntityA and EntityB in ManyToMany relationship. We are going to create a new instance of EntityA and add an existing instance of EntityB to it. We are creating a new POJO instance of EntityA and add an existing instance of EntityB to it. Then we persists the new instance of EntityA. Then we retrieve the instance of EntityA using OpenJPA and check the content of it. Without QueryCache this works well. But if the query cache is enabled the first time we get the instance of EntityA we get a properly populated EntityA instance but the second time we try to retrieve the same instance we get an empty set of included EntityB instance(s).

The attached test case demonstrates this issue clearly.
