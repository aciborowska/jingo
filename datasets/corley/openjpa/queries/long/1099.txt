Two files (J2DoPrivHelper.java, and SequencedActionsTest.java) have <xmp>...</xmp> in their Javadoc comments.  I don't know what the purpose of these tags may be in some environments.  IMO, they should be replaced by <pre>...</pre> tags which do not cause problems for the Javadoc.  The problem can be readily seen by opening the Javadoc of OpenJPA in a browser and clicking on index, then scroll down to the J2DoPrivHelper class entry.  I'll leave this bug open for a few days to allow a chance for comments, in case I'm missing something.
