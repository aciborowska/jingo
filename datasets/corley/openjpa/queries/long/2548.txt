The links on the download pages to versions 2.2.2 and 2.3.0 are broken.

This is because release publishing now must use svnpubsub, as per the e-mail from David Nalley dated Oct 24th.

Releases are now published by adding files to the appropriate SVN directory, in this case

https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/openjpa/

However this is empty, and so the ASF dist area is also empty, as are the mirrors.

Existing releases are stored in the archives server, so the currently active releases (i.e. 2.2.2 & 2.3.0) can be copied from there [1] to the SVN dist release area. By default only PMC members have the karma to do this.
