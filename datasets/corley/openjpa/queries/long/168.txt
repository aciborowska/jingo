There werre various comments from Patrick, Abe and Kevin Sutter about the code that I checked related to Optimize hint.  So I have gone back and relooked at this and wil be making some changes.  At Kevin's suggestion I will do this through a JIRA feature so that folks will have opportunity to comment on this before the code is actually done and checked in.
