For a ManyToMany relationship, I attempted to use the following in the orm to persist the related entities:

    <persistence-unit-metadata>
        <persistence-unit-defaults>
            <delimited-identifiers/>
        </persistence-unit-defaults>
    </persistence-unit-metadata>

Although openjpa appears to find this, it doesn't use it in an em.persist(). It does work, however, if I put cascade=CascadeType.persist on the @ManyToMany annotation of the entity that is specifically persisted.
