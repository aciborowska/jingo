I have a remote cache running and I don't want to have to add my domain classes to the remote cache's classpath. With this JIRA I'm going to lift this restriction.

Currently OpenJPAId and PCDataImpl have hard references to the domain Class files that they are operating over. We could change these references to transient and keep a hold of the stringified class names to reload the class if necessary.
