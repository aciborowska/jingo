When running the SchemaTool to reverse a DB Schema, an NPE occurs at getTableNameForMetadata for foreign keys (tables and pk / uq indices works correctly!)  Debugging shows that the tableName parameter is null when invoked.  The NPE is caused by the invocation of tableName.getUnqualifiedName() ... tableName is still null at that point!
