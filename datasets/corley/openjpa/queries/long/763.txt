We should integrate with Java encryption software solutions like JASYPT (http://www.jasypt.org/).  I see that they advertise a relationship with Hibernate already.  In a nutshell, via annotations or xml, it would be nice to identify fields that need to be encrypted and decrypted as the data goes in and out of the database.  We could do this "manually" via JPA listeners today, but then the logic falls onto the application code.  By linking in these existing encryption solutions, the work can be more seamless and transparent.
