Currently Slice uses @Replicated annotation on the entity class to designate that a type be replicated across slices.
This is the only place where 
a) application code needs source code level modification to use Slice
b) OpenJPA kernel (ClassMetaData) becomes aware of Replication feature

The proposal is to remove usage of @Replicated annotation altogether. The entities to be designated as replicated purely via configuration plug-in 'openjpa.slice.ReplicatedTypes" which will accept a comma-separated list of replicated type names.
