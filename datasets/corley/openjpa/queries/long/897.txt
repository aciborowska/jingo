Navigating from Table of Contents in OpenJPA web-based documentation is not very user-friendly. On the chunked version, you click a topic link in TOC and you go to a new page altogether.
It can be easier if TOC topics always appeared in a left-sided Navigational Panel. 
With my very limited skill on such matters, I have assembled a draft solution based on HTML Frame. Given that HTML Frames are not always supported by a browser, the fallback option is what it used to be.
The changes can be found in [1,2]. 

Because what is a 'user-friendly' navigation style of web-based document is a pretty subjective choice, please check if you prefer this new style or not.

If I hear lots of nays, the change will be rolled back.

Even if the style is accepted, given my very limited knowledge of XSL, HTML and other animals found in the web, some of you may suggest a much better way of achieving the same purpose.
