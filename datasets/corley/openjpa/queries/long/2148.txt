I am using oracle database with OpenJPA.

The DBDictionary class defines default MaxColumnNameLength as 128.

But In the OracleDictionary class which extend DBDictionary has MaxColumnNameLength as 30. While generating sql query, JPA takes first 28 characters of the column name and ignores rest of the characters. Also it takes start & end quotes, which in total makes it to 30 characters

Due to this, jpa query fails if there are column in the oracle database with more than 28 characters as it finds mismatch in SQL query and actual column name.  

Please fix this issue by changing MaxColumnNameLength in OracleDictionary class to 128.
