if you load an object which contains a Calendar object that has been persisted as date and time (in the case of mysql that's without milliseconds, just  : DATETIME of format	'0000-00-00 00:00:00') the milliseconds are not 0-ed out.

as an example I loaded the same identical object twice one right after the other and I did a Calendar. getTimeInMillis(). The results were 

1195149779501
1195149779540

I think 1195149779000 should have been the result. Right now it appears the millis were populated from the current time of the query, I did print a System.currentTimeMillis and it the millis seemed to match.
