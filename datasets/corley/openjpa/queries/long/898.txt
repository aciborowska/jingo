Hints defined for a named native query such as the one below don't get loaded, however, if changed it to @NamedQuery, the hints get loaded.

          @NamedNativeQuery(name="GetMemberInfo",
		query="CALL MEMBERSUB",
		hints= 
{
			@QueryHint(name="openjpa.hint.u2sub.numberofpara", value="2"),
			@QueryHint(name="openjpa.hint.u2sub.output.para", value ="2")
			}
		)
