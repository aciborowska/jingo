While checking the docbook, I figured that we use some pretty heavily outdated dependencies and plugins.

I think it's time now to to go through those and check if they can be replaced with newer versions. 
Of course this would require some serious testing - but this has to be done somewhen! 
So I would like to see this done before rather sooner than later.

There is a neat maven plugin to report such issues, but it seems that this is not as widely known as it should be. If my OpenJPA fellows already use this already, so excuse me and treat this as just a reminder

The most important goals.

$> mvn versions:help
In fact the 'help' goal exists for all maven plugins. So this is again just a reminder ...

$> mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
Shows all available plugin updates

$> mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
Shows all available dependency updates
