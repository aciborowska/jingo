Indices specified using javax.persistence.Index annotation are not being created

i saw a similar example but was hoping the index could be automatically 
created.  some indexes are automatically created but seeingly not others.
i tried the annotations as in the example and the index is never 
created.  here is what i have added to my class
@Entity
@Table(name = "billentry", indexes = 
{
         @Index(name = "I_BLLNTRY_SECTION", columnList = 
"BILLSECTION_ID", unique = false),
         @Index(name = "I_BLLNTRY_BILLTEMPLATEENTRY", columnList = 
"btentryid", unique = false) }
)
public class BillEntry implements Serializable {
     private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;


     @Id
     @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
     private Long id;


     @Version
     private Long version;


     @ManyToOne
     private BillSection billSection;


     @ManyToOne
     @Column(name = "btentryid")
     private BillTemplateEntry billTemplateEntry;
