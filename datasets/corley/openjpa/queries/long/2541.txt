In orm.xml, we have an entity which refers to another entity in an "one-to-many" relationship. 

When eager loading the main entity, we saw JPA fired "update" statements against the target entity table, which it shouldn't. 

After switching to lazy loading with the target entity set to be read-only, this problem no longer appears.
