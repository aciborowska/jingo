The attached testcase demonstrates that for a basic child query, OpenJPA generates SQL that contains two joined tables where only one is required.

SELECT t0.id, t1.id FROM Child t0 LEFT OUTER JOIN Parent t1 ON t0.PARENT_ID = t1.id WHERE (t0.PARENT_ID = ?)

This creates performance issues. Please note that this is a simplified testcase - performance issues are of course not present in it.

It can be expected that JPA that provides a layer of abstraction by nature, generates optimized SQL.

In light of the fact that this is a 2.0 release, the priority of solving this should be high.
