When a numeric column name is specified with a single number (ex: "1"), incorrect sql is generated. The sql is supposed to have a single set of double quotes around the name. Different incorrect sql is generated, depending on the release. For JPA 1.0 releases, there are no quotes (ex: 1). For JPA 2.0 releases, there are 2 sets of double quotes (ex: ""1""). This problem appears to exist for other DB identifiers also.
