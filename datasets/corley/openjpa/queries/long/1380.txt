I'm running on OpenJPA 1.2.1

The following query is added to the QueryCache:

Query: org.apache.openjpa.kernel.QueryImpl@3afe3afe;
candidate class: class com.ibm.usmi.datamodel.system.OperatingSystem;
query: SELECT distinct
OPERATINGSYSTEM1.OID,OPERATINGSYSTEM1.Guid,OPERATINGSYSTEM1.ObjectType,OPERATINGSYSTEM1.Name,REMOTESERVICEACCESSPOINT1.OID,REMOTESERVICEACCESSPOINT1.Guid,REMOTESERVICEACCESSPOINT1.ObjectType,REMOTESERVICEACCESSPOINT1.Name
FROM OperatingSystem
OPERATINGSYSTEM1,System_accessedVia_RemoteServiceAccessPoint
SYSTEM_ACCESSEDVIA_REMOTESERVICEACCESSPOINT1,RemoteServiceAccessPoint
REMOTESERVICEACCESSPOINT1,RelationshipInfo RELATIONSHIPINFO1 WHERE
OPERATINGSYSTEM1.OID = SYSTEM_ACCESSEDVIA_REMOTESERVICEACCESSPOINT1.sourceId
AND REMOTESERVICEACCESSPOINT1.OID =
SYSTEM_ACCESSEDVIA_REMOTESERVICEACCESSPOINT1.targetId AND
(OPERATINGSYSTEM1.Guid = ?1) AND (OPERATINGSYSTEM1.OID = ?2) AND
((OPERATINGSYSTEM1.BuildNumber = ?3)) AND (REMOTESERVICEACCESSPOINT1.Guid =
?4) AND (REMOTESERVICEACCESSPOINT1.OID = ?5) AND
((REMOTESERVICEACCESSPOINT1.Port = ?6)) AND RELATIONSHIPINFO1.changedDate >
?7 and RELATIONSHIPINFO1.sourceOID=OPERATINGSYSTEM1.OID and
RELATIONSHIPINFO1.relationshipType = ?8 and
RELATIONSHIPINFO1.targetOID=REMOTESERVICEACCESSPOINT1.OID

Later on, a record in RelationshipInfo is changed, which changes what should
be returned from this query.  I'd expect this to cause the cached query to
get evicted from the QueryCache, but it is not.  If I get the
QueryResultCache, and evictAll RelationshipInfo.class, it still doesn't get
removed.  This seems to be because the AccessPath only contains
OperatingSystem.  I'd expect this to contain all entities that this query
deals with:
                {OperatingSystem,
System_accessedVia_RemoteServiceAccessPoint, RemoteServiceAccessPoint,
RelationshipInfo}
But the AccessPath only seems to contain the entity of what is returned from
the query.

What do I need to do so this query gets evicted like I'd expect.

This problem can be easily reproduced by the following query:

  String jpql = "select p.name, c.name from OneOneParent p, OneOneChild c where " + 
            "p.id = c.id and c.name = ?1";

	The query cache key is:

"org.apache.openjpa.datacache.QueryKey@d11db9a4
[
    query:[select p.name, c.name from OneOneParent p, OneOneChild c where p.id = c.id and c.name = ?1],
    access path:[queryCache.OneOneParent],
    subs:true,
    ignoreChanges:false,
    startRange:0,
    endRange:9223372036854775807,timeout:-1
]".

This problem can be resolved if access path in QueryKey also contains queryCache.OneOneChild.
