We are using criteria builder to frame the query, Select clause having CASE expression and same was placed in GROUP BY Clause as well.

Example Query:

SELECT  SUM(
  CASE
    WHEN t1.IND = 1
    THEN t0.HRS
    ELSE 0
  END ),
  CASE
    WHEN t0.TRANS_DAY_KY >= 20150322
    AND t0.TRANS_DAY_KY  <= 20150328
    THEN 'Wk - 13'
    WHEN t0.TRANS_DAY_KY >= 20150329
    AND t0.TRANS_DAY_KY  <= 20150404
    THEN 'Wk - 14'
    ELSE NULL
  END AS Period

  FROM TIME to,NEWTIME t1
  WHERE (t0.TRANS_DAY_KY                   >= 20150322
  AND t0.TRANS_DAY_KY                      <= 20150404)
  GROUP BY
  CASE
    WHEN t0.TRANS_DAY_KY >= 20150322
    AND t0.TRANS_DAY_KY  <= 20150328
    THEN 'Wk - 13'
    WHEN t0.TRANS_DAY_KY >= 20150329
    AND t0.TRANS_DAY_KY  <= 20150404
	THEN 'Wk - 14'
  ELSE NULL
  END 


We are using OpenJpa to implement this Query. OpenJPA Implementation for CASE expression is like below.

Case<String> selectCaseForSelections = cb.<String>selectCase();
selectCaseForSelections.when(cb.and(cb.greaterThanOrEqualTo(dayKey, cb.literal(startTime)), cb.lessThanOrEqualTo(dayKey, cb.literal(endTime))), interval.getName());
selections.add(selectCaseForSelections.alias("Period");  // Adding the CASE Expression to SELECT Clause
groupByCols.add(selectCaseForSelections);  // Adding the CASE Expression to GROUP BY Clause


Console TRACE Log shows below Query and Exception.

        THEN 'Wk - 14' ELSE NULL END

The Problem i could see is that Bind parameters are not passed to the GROUP BY Clause. Only for SELECT clause they were passed.
Is it the OpenJPA Limitation ? Could someone help me out.

Thanks in advance.
