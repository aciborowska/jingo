Entity objects that are pulled out from the database using bean methods (get*()) are not the same objects that are pulled out using using other methods(find(), getReference()). 

This occurs only when using Single Table Inheritance.

This works on 0.9.7, in other versions Exception is thrown (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-494) , in latest version from trunk test fails.
