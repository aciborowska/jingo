WebUser entity has a HashMap of WebUserPreferences.
WebUserPreference has a UniqueConstraint defined on 2 fields.
Can reproduce in DB2 DB with attached DDL.

Basically, what is happening is, that the test case goes through and adds 4 WebUserPreferences to the WebUser.  Then persists the WebUser.  Then adds 4 more WebUserPreferences to the same WebUser, same name and web user (constraint columns).  The Entity is then merged.  The WebUser Entity has the correct 4 WebUserPreferences, but the database has all 8 rows.  Was expecting to see the first 4 rows be removed from the database (or maybe they should have been updated with the more recent value data).

Also, even if the second set of values are the same as the first set of values, then there are still 8 rows in the database, the 4 original rows and the second set of duplicate rows.
