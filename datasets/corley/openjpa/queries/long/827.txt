When you have Entity A with a single-table inheritance strategy it would be nice if, when modeling B, C, D ... as subclasses of A JPA would make sure that there are no two columns with clashing names and incompatible types. For example, if B has a field Date defaultValue and C has a field Long defaultValue.
