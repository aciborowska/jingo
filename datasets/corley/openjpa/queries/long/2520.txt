As part of the requirement for a project need to achive following, for which the auditor piece of OpenJPA 2.2 is used: 
1)  These are two different database. One for Audit and the other as a transactional database.Updating audit database with status of the updates from transactional database. 
2) Send update notification through MQ/Topic.

All of the above requirement needs to be managed as part of single Transaction. All the resource are XA enabled.

Currently we are facing following challenges while implementing Auditor: 

	Auditor is not able to get handle of Entity Manager required for updating transactional database.
	If the data source is XA enables, auditor is not getting invoked. If the transaction is not a 2 phase commit the auditor get invoked.
	Not able to get reference of Spring Beans inside the Auditor.



Can you please guide. 

We are planning to debug the issue but currently there is not system design document which we can refer and identify the classes which is controlling the Auditor. Please let know if we can get an view of how the auditor piece is managed.
