Hi all, this bug is to report a confusing and misplaced error message. Problem is described below. Feel free to request more info from me.

When running my project with OpenJPA, I get the following error message:

140  INFO   [http-0.0.0.0-8080-Processor23] openjpa.Runtime - Starting OpenJPA 1.0.0
380  INFO   [http-0.0.0.0-8080-Processor23] openjpa.jdbc.JDBC - Using dictionary class "org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.sql.DB2Dictionary".
20  WARN   [http-0.0.0.0-8080-Processor25] openjpa.Runtime - The property named "openjpa.Id" was not recognized and will be ignored, although the name closely matches a valid property called "openjpa.Id".
100  INFO   [http-0.0.0.0-8080-Processor25] openjpa.Runtime - Starting OpenJPA 1.0.0
300  INFO   [http-0.0.0.0-8080-Processor25] openjpa.jdbc.JDBC - Using dictionary class "org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.sql.DB2Dictionary".

As you can see, the two property names printed are the same, not different or similar. I retyped all my @Id annotations to make sure there was no special character in one of them coming from copy&paste.
Furthermore, I was able to identify that the error message was being printed only when I removed the @Id annotation from one of my classes (all the other classes still have @Id).

Here is a sample of my class without @Id annotation:
@Entity
@Table(name="TAX", schema="JPA_SC")
public class Tax  {

	// Class variables  
	protected double taxamount;

	public Tax(){

	}

	public Tax(double taxamount)
{
		this.taxamount = taxamount;
	}
//plus getter and setter for taxamount

}
