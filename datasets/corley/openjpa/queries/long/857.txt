Detection and storage of the JPA specification level will be necessary to help maintain backward compatibility with prior versions of OpenJPA.  This item is to design and implement a solution to deterministically detect the version requested by the application (likely based on application artifacts such as the persistence.xml) and store the information such that OpenJPA can use the information at runtime to help maintain backward compatibility.
