An entity has a persistent field which is a serialable class annotated with @Lob.  I am able to 
create and persist instances of this entity and field.  But when the entity is retrieved and the 
field is updated, the update is not written back at commit.

@Entity
 class Employee {
  @Id  int id;
  @Lob  Address home;

class Home implements Serializable {
    String street 


  EntityManager em =
  em.getTransaction().begin();
  Employee e = em.find(Employee.class, 1);
  Address home = e.getHome();
  home.setStreet("123 New Avenue");
  e.setHome(e);
  em.getTransaction().commit();   <--  the update to home address does not occur.
