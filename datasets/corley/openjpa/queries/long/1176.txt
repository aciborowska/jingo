OpenJPA versions prior to 2.0 allowed properties marked as private to be persistent.  This is contrary to the JPA specification which states that properties must be public or protected.  OpenJPA 2.0 will adhere to the specification by default, but a compatibility option will be added to allow the old behavior.
