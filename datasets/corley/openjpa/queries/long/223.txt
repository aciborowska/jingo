It looks like we completely ignore the "columnNames" field of the org.apache.openjpa.persistence.jdbc.Index annotation. From Jonathan Feinberg on the mailing list:

Is there any way to cause the OpenJPA schema builder to emit an index across multiple columns? My attempt,
 @Column(columnDefinition = "bytea")
 @Index(name = "i_owner_md5", columnNames = 
{ "owner_id, md5" }
)
 public byte[] getMd5()
 {
  return md5;
 }

is silently misinterpreted, in that only the annotated field (md5) gets indexed.
