Looks like OpenJPA always gets the time stamp out at the time zone of the machine, not the time zone that was used originally.

The test case is putting in 2 TimeStamps
    TTimestamp = 4-3-2004 21:0:0.0 (America/New_York)
    TTimestampUTC = 4-4-2004 2:0:0.0 (UTC)

When OpenJPA gets those 2 timesamps back out of the database, they are 
    TTimestamp = 4-3-2004 21:0:0.0 (America/New_York)
    TTimestampUTC = 4-3-2004 21:0:0.0 (America/New_York)
