There is an inconsistency in the way exceptions are thrown from MetaDataRepository.resolve(ClassMetaData).
If there are more than one error encountered while resolving metadata then all these exceptions are wrapped inside MetaDataException 
and the MetaDataException is thrown. If there is only single exception thrown then that exception is thrown without wrapping inside MetaDataException.

So, in case of single error encountered any exception ( need not be MetaDataException) is thrown 
but in case of multiple errors encountered MetaDataException is thrown.

Now, there is a method loadRegisteredClassMetaData() inside same class which calls the above resolve method ( via other method calls).
This loadRegisteredClassMetaData() catches MetaDataException and logs a warning, which is an expected behavior.
But as resolve(), in case of a single error , throws an exception other than MetaDataException loadRegisteredClassMetaData() is not
able to catch this Exception.

I think this inconsistence behavior has to be fixed inside MetaDataRepository.resolve().
