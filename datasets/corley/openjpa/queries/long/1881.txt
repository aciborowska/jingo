The Enhance trace log outputs a message indicating whether enhancement is necessary or not (true or false).  And, if enhancement is necessary, a message is logged indicating that this process is starting and which classloader is being used.  But, there is no "enhancement complete" message.  And, following an idea from the WebSphere App Server, knowing the before and after byte size might be interesting.  So, this JIRA will be used to log a message similar to the following when the enhancement processing is complete:

719  TRACE  [main] openjpa.Enhance - Enhancement for "my/entities/OrderlineJPA" completed. Class size: [3,292/14,045]
