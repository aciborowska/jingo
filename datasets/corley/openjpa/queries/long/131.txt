Currently, OpenJPA needs fields to exist in classes in order to load data into the VM. It would be great if instead, it were possible to issue a query and get back a java.util.Map of key-value pairs corresponding to the data requested, or if it were possible to have a field of type Map in an instance that was used to access all "dynamic" keys and their values. This would be useful for user-mutated schemas, or for open content, such as is available in XML.
