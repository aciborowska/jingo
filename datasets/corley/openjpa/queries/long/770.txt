In openjpa-persistence-jdbc/pom.xml there are a lot of excluded testcases. Instead of hard coding these in pom.xml we should use the new annotation that Pinaki introduced in the "parent" JIRA issue. 

The list of excluded tests can be found in pom.xml, here's a subsection of them

<!-- exclude new tests that aren't passing yet -->
                        <exclude>org/apache/openjpa/persistence/jpql/clauses/TestEJBQueryInterface.java</exclude>
                        <exclude>org/apache/openjpa/persistence/kernel/TestInitialValueFetching.java</exclude>
                        <exclude>org/apache/openjpa/persistence/kernel/TestOpenResultsCommit.java</exclude>
                        <exclude>org/apache/openjpa/persistence/query/TestQuotedNumbersInFilters2.java</exclude>
