Oracle 8 JOIN syntax is produced for Oracle 10g reported from a customer. 
Oracle 9 or later release do support SQL92 JOIN syntax.

Should we fix it in OracleDictionary ?

The proposed fix is :
  change the initial setting of 
    joinSyntax = SYNTAX_DATABASE;   ==>  joinSyntax = SYNTAX_SQL92;

I am not sure whether this fix affecting those accessing Oracle thru jdbc:datadirect.

Could anyone familiar with datadirect comment on this fix ?
Thanks.
