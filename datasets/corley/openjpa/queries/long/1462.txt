This discussion on our Users mailing list shows a memory leak while using the subclassing support.  This customer was using OpenJPA 1.2.1 which still allowed the fall-back usage of the subclassing support.  We have since turned this off in 1.3.x and trunk (2.0.x).

Once this customer changed their build to perform the PCEnhancement processing, the memory leak went away.

Just logging this issue in case we ever resurrect the subclassing support for OpenJPA.
