Hello,

I provide this patch to improve the compliant of OpenJPA to Java 5+.
Changes included in this patch are :
======

	Migrating from commons-lang to commons-lang3 :
Implies :
-> Removing call to NestedExceptions classes.Explanation from commons-lang homepage :
"In Java 1.4, the notion that all Throwables could be linked to a cause was introduced. In Lang we had provided a NestedException framework to support the same feature, and now that we're jumping from Java 1.3 to Java 5 we are remove this feature. The deprecation section below covers one part of ExceptionUtils that remains until we are on Java 6, where the last remaining parts of the JDK appear to have embraced the new cause API."



-> Replace package **.apache.commons.lang to **.apache.commons.lang3


	Migrating SLF4J artefact to 1.7.5 :
According to SLF4J news (http://www.slf4j.org/news.html) :


	Given the significance of these performance improvements, users are highly encouraged to migrate to SLF4J version 1.7.5 or later.




	Migrating artefact org.apache.bval.bundle form version 0.3-incubating to 0.5 (removing direct SLF4J 1.6.1 and commons-lang2 dependencies)



If this patch is approved, I will create a subtask for adding @Override annotation to all java classes (maven-compiler plugin is configured to target bytecode version 1.6).
