The Allowfailure annotation dumps the stack of any exceptions which occur. There are currently a lot of classes / methods which use AllowFailure and this leads to a large log file filled with exceptions which are not particularly informative. 

AllowFailure should be configurable so that the tests may be skipped or at least no log misleading information.
