SolidDB (http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/soliddb/) is an in-memory relational database from IBM.  Supposedly, it's JDBC compliant and, thus, shouldn't be a major effort to create a dictionary.

Besides drumming up JPA support for existing SolidDB customers, this database may also prove fruitful from our own junit regression testing.  Using an in-memory database may help speed up our junit bucket over the current usage of Derby.
