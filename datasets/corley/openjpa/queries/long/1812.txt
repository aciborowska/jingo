Using the example from OPENJPA-1804 I added HostName and EmailAddress to the class list, updated the JVM launcher command to use the Java agent enhancer, and added:

            <property name="openjpa.jdbc.SynchronizeMappings" value="buildSchema(foreignKeys=true)"/>

Note also:

            <property name="openjpa.ConnectionURL" value="jdbc:h2:mem:test"/>

When I tried to run the example, it failed when attempting to create an index, saying that address_book_table (which it created a few milliseconds earlier) did not exist.

Changing H2 to use a database on disk fixed the problem:

            <property name="openjpa.ConnectionURL" value="jdbc:h2:~/openjpatestdb"/>

But why is OpenJPA sensitive to whether I'm using an in-memory or disk H2 database?

I tried opening the same in-memory database URL using my IDE's JDBC console.  Of course I got a different database, since the IDE is running in its own JVM.  But I was able to execute the "create table" from the OpenJPA log followed by the "create index" without any trouble.
