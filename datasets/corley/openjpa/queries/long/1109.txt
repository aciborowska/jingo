This has been a problem when merge a parent object, the parent object has a set with child as entry. The child object equals() method are rely on child.key property. 
In some case, the parent.children set was attached before the child.key property was attached. Then only one entry will be in the set since the children are equals() with child.key=null.

Possible solution: Move collection to be process last while attach an object. This give a chance for all other single property been attached, so it won't break the equals() logic.
