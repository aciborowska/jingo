As discussed on the openjpa-user MailingList I need to enable the OpenJPA QueryCache in a selective way, i. e. it should be disabled unless I enable it explicitly using query.getFetchPlan().setQueryResult(true).

IÂ´ve figured out that this requires FetchConfigurationImpl$ConfigurationState#queryCache to be set to false by default, however, there does not seem to be a configuration property for this.

So I propose a new configuration property like openjpa.jdbc.QueryCacheDefaultState, defaulting to true (the current default), with possibility to set to false. This would set the property FetchConfigurationImpl$ConfigurationState#queryCache accordingly.

As a workaround it is currently only possible to use a custom BrokerFactory to implement the required behaviour (see also OPENJPA-2542).
