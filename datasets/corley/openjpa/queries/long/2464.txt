After upgrading from OpenJPA 2.2.2 to 2.3.0, I'm getting spurious update events from the Auditor for fields that haven't changed at all.

This affects entities with multiple copies of an embeddable using different association overrides.

See the attached test project which passes with 2.2.2 but fails with 2.3.0.
