While writing a custom PreparedStatementManager I have a Statement that I want to pass to the org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.kernel.PreparedStatementManagerImpl.logSQLWarnings method, but that method incorrectly requires a PreparedStatement.

With this JIRA I'm going to change the parameter type for this method to accept a Statement.
