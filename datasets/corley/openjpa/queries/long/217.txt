Consider a scenario where we have an entity class as shown below:
class A
{
 long id;
String str1;
String str2;
}
Say for str2 attribute there will be length constraint something like 
<basic name="str2" >
          <column name="col2"  length="4"/>        
 </basic>

Now say i have a jpql select query as shown below :
Query q = em.createQuery("select t from A t where t.str2:paramvalue");
q.setParameter("paramvalue", "23");

The above query return empty result set even though the records are present in table.
But when i set the value from "23" to "23  " (i.e. with trailing 2 spaces) it works.


Can the padding of additional empty spaces be taken care default by jpa itself for select kind of queries.
