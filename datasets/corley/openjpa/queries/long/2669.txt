The apache karaf enterprise feature contains too many different features and versions. This can easily confuse users and cause wrong versions to be installed. It is also not possible to install e.g. openjpa 3 in an apache karaf that is already released as the enterprise feature can not be changed for a release.

So we plan to move feature definitions to the projects that create the software to be installed.

The main advantage is that the user can freely choose which openjpa version to install independent of the karaf version.

This issue tackles to create a feature repo for openjpa 3.0.0 and also to adapt the OSGi package imports to the jpa 2.1 spec. I will create a github PR for this.
