OpenJPA's MetaDataRepository fails to load metadata for classess when multiple threads use the same EntityManagerFactory class to resolve the metadata.  The MetaDataRepository implementation is not thread safe.The problem only occurrs on multi core or multi processor machines that can concurrently try to initialize meta data for classes.

To reproduce the problem I have inserted a sleep statement within the code to help reproduce the problem consistently.  I have commented out the sleep statement in my deployed version of the class.

This bug is sort of related to issue 250.  I have cleaned up all of the synchronization in the class.  There should be less contention, however it could still be better if a ReentrantReadWriteLock was used.  I noticed that someone had posted a new MetaDataRepository with a ReentrantReadWriteLock, but too seems to have the same issues.
