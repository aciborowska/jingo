OpenJPA models L2 cache as one or more named partitions. And is able to assign a managed instance to a named partition. However, this distribution of managed instances to specific named partition is based on the instance's type and not an the instance itself. The type based as distribution allows the named cache partition be specified at metadata level. 

This proposed feature is to introduce a distribution policy that extends the support for instance based distribution policy.
