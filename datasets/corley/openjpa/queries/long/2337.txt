When using the JPA ClassFileTransformer from a javaagent the expected workflow is to simply convert in memory original class byte[] to an enhanced byte[].

However since the code is shared with ant task, mvn plugin and main() enhancer it also updates the file physically.

That's a pain for load time weaving.

Could it be skipped when using the ClassFileTransformer?

sounds like a bug for me, wdyt?
