hi 
any plan for port jdbc module to hsqldb to latest 2.x series?
i have this problem:
org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.sql.HSQLDictionary.java, the referenced class
is org.hsqldb.Trace. Trace used to contain various error codes, amidst
others VIOLATION_OF_UNIQUE_INDEX . Some of the old error codes in
Trace were ported to the class org.hsqldb.error.ErrorCode in newer
versions of HSQLDB, but VIOLATION_OF_UNIQUE_INDEX is not among them.
any ideas?
thanks in advance for every suggestion
