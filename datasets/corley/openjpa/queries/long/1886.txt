This is the same problem as reported by OPENJPA-1678 except it is coming from openjpa.Query.

To recreate this problem, run org.apache.openjpa.persistence.querycache.TestQueryCache and enable "openjpa.Log","Query=trace". 

375  test  TRACE  [main] openjpa.Query - Executing query: [SELECT o FROM Entity1 o WHERE o.pk = :pk] with parameters: 
{pk=2}
