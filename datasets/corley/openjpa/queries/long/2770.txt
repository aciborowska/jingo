Using CriteriaBuilder.literal(Boolean.FALSE) in expressions leads to literal value being treated as TRUE instead.

See https://github.com/veselov/Standalone-JPA-Test-Demo/tree/OPENJPA-2770 for test case.
I've also attached the extracted branch here.
Running

$ mvn -Dderby.language.logStatementText=true test


shows the problem. Though the cb.literal(Boolean.FALSE) is use in cb.equal(), the query is:

Wed Jan 23 00:24:51 CET 2019 Thread[main,5,main] (XID = 283), (SESSIONID = 11), (DATABASE = memory:jpaDemoDB), (DRDAID = null), Executing prepared statement: SELECT t0.user_id, t0.about, t0.firstName, t0.homePage, t0.lastName, t0.userName, t0.woo FROM Person t0 WHERE (t0.woo = ?) :End prepared statement with 1 parameters begin parameter #1: true :end parameter



I changed versions to 2.4.3 and 3.0.0, the problem is still there.
