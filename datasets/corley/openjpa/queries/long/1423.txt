AnnotationPersistenceMappingSerializer decides whether or not to include the referencedColumnName attribute in the @ManyToOne annotation based on whether the column passed to the serializeColumn() method has a non-null value for getTarget() (see line 544 or thereabouts).  But the kind of column that is passed to this method will never have a target, as far as I can tell.  Consequently it looks like referencedColumnName can never be output.
