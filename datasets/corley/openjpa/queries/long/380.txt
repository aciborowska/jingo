When an EMF is closed it attempts to get a MetaDataRepositoryInstance. If no instance has been created (the EMF hasn't been used) it will create a new one - which entails opening a connection to the database.

The MDR is only used to un-register itself as a class listener, so in this case it's rather pointless to create a new one.
