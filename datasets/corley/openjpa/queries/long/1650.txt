Current support for adding a new Slice dynamically exists at three places

DistributedBrokerFactory.addSlice(String name, Map properties)
DistributedConfiguration.addSlice(String name, Map properties)
DistributedBroker.addSlice(String name, Map properties)

This is confusing. A new slice should only be added via DistributedBrokerFactory.
