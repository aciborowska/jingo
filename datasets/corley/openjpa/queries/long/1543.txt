This file contains a number of messages that are fragments
/openjpa-jdbc/src/main/resources/org/apache/openjpa/jdbc/kernel/localizer.properties

These fragments are put together into complete messages by PreparedQueryImpl.java and PreparedQueryCacheImpl.java

This needs to be changed so that each message is a complete message rather than putting it together as fragments as fragments are often hard to translate so that the complete message reads correctly.

Also, Kevin recommends that this message be TRACE instead of INFO.
