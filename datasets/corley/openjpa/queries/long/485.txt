Symptom:
Generates wrong SQL query 
   "SELECT t1.id, t1.name, t0.name FROM  ORDER BY t0.name ASC"
for a JPQL Query 
   "SELECT p FROM Base p ORDER BY p.name"

Condition:
    where Base class uses TABLE_PER_CLASS inheritance strategy and has one or more known subclasses.

Cause:
   The routine that fails to handle aliasing and leaves the table in FROM clause empty is JDBCStoreManager.selectBaseMappings() line 1028-1031. 


Note:
  Queries that do not use ORDER BY on the same class hierarchy such as
  "SELECT p FROM Base [WHERE <some condition>]" 
  works.
