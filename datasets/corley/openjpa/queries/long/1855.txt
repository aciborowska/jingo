While I was working on a unit test I had the following property set and it was being silently ignored by the runtime. After digging around a bunch, I figured out that it is actually an invalid configuration. I can specify this property on em.setProperty(...)[3.7.2], but I can't set a 'default' value at the provider(emf) level.

<property name="javax.persistence.cache.storeMode" value="BYPASS"/>

[3.7.2] -
Cache retrieve mode and cache store mode properties may be specified at the level of the persistence
context by means of the EntityManager setProperty method. These properties may be specified for
the EntityManager find and refresh methods and the Query and TypedQuery setHint methods.
Cache retrieve mode and/or cache store mode properties specified for the find, refresh, and
Query and TypedQuery setHint methods override those specified for the persistence context for
the specified find and refresh invocations, and for the execution of the specified queries respectively.

With this JIRA I want to detect some of the invalid configurations and log a .... [INFO,WARN,TRACE]? message. Per the spec (8.2.1.9) "If a persistence provider does not recognize a property (other than a property defined by this specification), the provider must ignore it." I believe this gives us the leeway to do something about the condition that I ran into.
