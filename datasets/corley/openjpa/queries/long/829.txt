Reviewing QueryImpl, I believe there are a few methods that are missing the assertNotReadOnly check:

setIgnoreChanges
setCandidateCollection
setResultMapping
setResultType
setRange





ps - I haven't been around enough so I don't know about the utility of the readOnly feature.  But some things seem off:

Query.java defines assertNotReadOnly
QueryContext.java defines set/isReadOnly
  yes no body calls QueryContext.set/isReadOnly
  so it looks like a feature that's not used...
