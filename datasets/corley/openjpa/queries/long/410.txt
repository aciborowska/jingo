Discussed on our dev mailing list:  http://www.nabble.com/Change-%22connecting-to-dictionary%22-message-from-Info-to-Trace--tf4647416.html  

Since nobody dissented, I'm going to go ahead with changing this message from an Info to a Trace entry.  Existing users of OpenJPA have already figured out how to ignore the message or change their configuration to avoid it, so it should be no problem with changing it.
