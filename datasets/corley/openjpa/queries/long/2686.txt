When looking at the content of the openjpa jar file (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/openjpa/openjpa/2.4.2/openjpa-2.4.2.jar), there are pom.properties and pom.xml in META-INF/maven/ for openjpa and also for openjpa-jdbc, openjpa-kernel, openjpa-lib, etc

But most of the pom.properties and pom.xml files does not relate to the real openjpa artifact and should not be there.

As seen in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHADE-240, the files could be relocated using the following shade configuration:


               <relocation>
                  <pattern>META-INF/maven</pattern>
                  <shadedPattern>META-INF/shade/maven</shadedPattern>
                  <excludes>
                    <exclude>META-INF/maven/${project.groupId}/${project.artifactId}/pom.*</exclude>
                  </excludes>
                </relocation>



in the openjpa/pom.xml file.
