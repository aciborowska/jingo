The org.apache.openjpa.lib.conf.Value.setAliases method does not copy the array of strings passed as a parameter.  As a result, later operations on the Value object's aliases can change the array that the caller is using.  This method should be pass by value rather than by reference â€“ in other words, the method should copy the array.
