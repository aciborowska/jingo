Defining UniqueConstraint on MappedSuperClass fails with NPE [1]

@MappedSuperclass
@Table(uniqueConstraints={@UniqueConstraint(columnNames=
{"ATTR_NAME", "OWNER"}
)})
public abstract class Attribute<T> { 

While it is debatable a @Table annotation is appropriate for @MappedSuperClass, the situation must be detected and warned more gracefully than a NPE.

Also investigate whether UniqueConstraint on a MappedSuperClass should be supported.
