I have written a custom classloader and I can't work out how to get OpenJPA to use it to load my entity classes.
I've followed instructions I found to set Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader() at startup before loading any EntityManager and it seems to load the OpenJPA classes and a lot of others, but not the class I'm interested in.

Is this the right approach?
If so, where have I gone wrong? (http://openjpa.208410.n2.nabble.com/Dynamic-Table-value-td5645906.html)
If not, how should this be done?
Is there some sort of guide to accomplishing this that someone could point me to?

Thanks.
