The hint, 'openjpa.hint.UseLiteralInSQL', is not properly converting a boolean to an int.  To illustrate this, lets take this entity:

public class MyEntity implements Serializable {
 @Id
 private Integer pk;

 private boolean flag;
..........


With this entity, lets take this test:

Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT f FROM MyEntity f WHERE f.flag = true");
q.setHint("openjpa.hint.UseLiteralInSQL", "false");  //false is the default
q.getResultList();


With this code, the following SQL will be generated:

SELECT t0.pk, t0.code, t0.code2, t0.flag FROM MyEntity t0 WHERE (t0.flag = ?)  [params=(int) 1]


Next, lets take this code:

Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT f FROM MyEntity f WHERE f.flag = true");
q.setHint("openjpa.hint.UseLiteralInSQL", "true");
q.getResultList();


With this code, the following SQL will be generated:

SELECT t0.pk, t0.code, t0.code2, t0.flag FROM MyEntity t0 WHERE (t0.flag = true)


However, in the latter case where UseLiteralInSQL=true, the following SQL should be generated:

SELECT t0.pk, t0.code, t0.code2, t0.flag FROM MyEntity t0 WHERE (t0.flag = '1')
