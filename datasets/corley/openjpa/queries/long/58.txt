The snapshots at

 http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository/

were last updated on august 26th.

The wiki points to this repository from here:

 http://cwiki.apache.org/openjpa/obtaining.html

Probably good to either add something to the wiki so that people don't expect a daily snapshot there or simply keep uploading snapshots
