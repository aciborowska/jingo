Date valued query parameter such as java.util.Date gets bound as timestamp during prepared query reparametrization. Though the parameter value carries the exact type, the prepared query executor when binds the value via DBDictionary setDate(...) – the logic defaults the value to be bound to the JDBC statement as Timestamp. DB2 database does not like the type change and returns wrong result –   MySQL/Derby etc tolarates the type change and gets correct result.
