Problem

MultiValuedTrasveralAttempt  not evaluated when there is another field with the same name in the path.

Steps:

1. Create a client entity as:


@Entity
public class Client {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Integer id;

    @OneToMany
    private Collection<Product> products;

...



2. and a Product:


@Entity
public class Product {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Integer id;

    @ManyToOne
    private Client client;

    private Boolean deleted = false;

...



3. Run this query:

SELECT DISTINCT c 
FROM Client c JOIN FETCH c.products 
WHERE c.products.deleted = false

Result is: "JPQL does not allow traversal through multi-valued relation path. Try join instead"

4. Add a deleted field to the client:



private Boolean deleted;




5. Run the query again

No errors!

Expected result:

Same exception when client have a deleted field

org.apache.openjpa.kernel.exps.AbstractExpressionBuilder.traversePath  is finding the wrong deleted field in the c.products path (the client.delete) and isMultiValuedTraversalAttempt is never evaluated
