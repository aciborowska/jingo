I think there is a bug in OpenJPA Slices for Bulk Update Queries (At least for Bulk Delete Statements).

So, if doing a bulk JPQL delete (E.G. "delete from Entity e where e.id in :ids"), - all slices are hit with the query regardless of Policy plugins and Query hints set to target just one slice.

I have implemented DistributionPolicy, FinderTargetPolicy and QueryTargetPolicy as well as setting the "openjpa.hint.slice.Target" hint on the query and EntityManager.
All slices are hit regardless of the above when we need to just target 1 Slice. This causes big problems for us, as some tables do not exist in all slices and queries fail.

Reproducing this is easy:
1/ Set up 2 slices
2/ Create table "Person" in slice A but NOT in slice B
3/ Register simple  DistributionPolicy, FinderTargetPolicy and QueryTargetPolicy plugins with OpenJPA Slices, - all hard-coded to only return slice A.
4/ Execute JPQL delete "Delete from Person p where p.id = :id" with query hint to slice A
5/ See that the delete update query is executed against all slices not just slice A as required by target plugins and query hint 
6/ Query fails against slice B because table does not exist in slice B. 

We have set query hints etc. - but returning slice A in QueryTargetPolicy should be enough
