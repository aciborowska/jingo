It seems to be common that JPA providers include persistence_1_0.xsd in one of the distribution jars. I'm not sure if this is according to the spec but some tools such as Spring already depend on that behaviour.

This is probably mostly relevant for using JPA in a J2SE environment as I think the xsd is probably provided by the app server.

Discussion on the Spring forum about this:
