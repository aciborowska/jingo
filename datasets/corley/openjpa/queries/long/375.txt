Invalid operation: Result set is closed is reported from DB2, running in Web Container, non-jta-data-source, transaction local, JEE environment.
A workaround is to set the following property in persistence.xml for DB2:
<property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary"
            value="db2(supportsMultipleNontransactionalResultSets=false)"/>
