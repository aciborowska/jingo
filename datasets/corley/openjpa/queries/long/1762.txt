I have a simple failing unit test that exercises a small portion of the javax.persistence.lock.scope=Extended property. The failing scenario is as follows:

ManyToMany relationship between A(owner) and B.

Em1 - Find A, no lock
Em1 - Refresh A, PESSIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT and javax.persistence.lock.scope=PessimisticLockScope.EXTENDED â€“ this SHOULD lock the join table for A_B
Em2 - Find, lock B. Remove B.  should block while trying to remove from Join table.

I will post the unit test which demonstrates the problem shortly.
