The Agimatec Validation code is now being maintained and updated as the Apache Bean Validation incubator project.
This issue will be used to update the openjpa-integration/validation/ tests to support using this new provider.
For trunk, we'll switch to the Apache BVAL as the default provider for testing, but 2.0.x will continue to use the Hibernate provider.
