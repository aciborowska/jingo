in my case i'm using an ear with multiple war files.

the entities are located in ear/lib and my select new result class and the service which loads it are located in a war (doesn't matter if in WEB-INF/lib or WEB-INF/classes)

openJPA uses the CL stored in QueryImpl but this one can not load my class.

imo if the class can not be loaded with the stored class loader, we can try to use the TCCL to load the class.
