The optimization within EmbedFieldStrategy.containsEmbeddedResult() is designed to fast-exit when it encounters an eager-loaded Embeddable field that is not in the ResultSet, which causes the Embeddable to be treated as unloaded.  This behavior can conflict with a native query that selectively excluded fetching embeddable fields that are normally eager, resulting in the whole embeddable being null rather than partially hydrated by the native sql query's ResultSet.
