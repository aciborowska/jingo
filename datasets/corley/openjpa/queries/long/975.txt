Oracle application has a JPQL query that attempts to set a parameter to '\'. '\' is not a reserved character with Oracle and the query will work if you execute it "normally" with JDBC.

OpenJPA automatically adds ESCAPE ('\') to every search SQL query.  As a result the \ is interpreted as an escape indicator and the SQL will not execute as expected.
