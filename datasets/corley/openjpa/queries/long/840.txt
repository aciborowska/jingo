While working on a JPA 2.0 feature I found that OpenJPA does not process the catalog attribute on several standard JPA 1.0 annotations or in orm metadata files.  Based on the dictionary(ies), it appears that the default catalog is used.  Some databases (SQL Server) allow a catalog to be specified within the SQL/DDL - ex.  mycatalog.myschema.mytable.  OpenJPA should support the use of metadata specified catalog(s) attributes for those databases which support them.
