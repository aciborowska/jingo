<property name="openjpa.InitializeEagerly" value="true"/> breaks the bean-validation integration

AbstractBrokerFactory#makeReadOnly
evaluates conf.isInitializeEagerly() which returns true (due to the config) and calls _conf.setReadOnly(Configuration.INIT_STATE_FROZEN)
+ at the end of AbstractBrokerFactory#initializeBroker it gets called again

that causes:
the created BrokerFactory gets used as argument for PersistenceProviderImpl#loadValidator which fails (with a warning or an exception depending on the validation-mode configured in the persistence.xml) because the config is in state INIT_STATE_FROZEN
