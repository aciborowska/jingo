A persistence unit should provide access to a remote, non-Java client in a RESTful fashion.

The communication protocol should be HTTP.
The 'safe' operations (HTTP GET for find, query, properties, metamodel browsing etc) can be encoded in URI syntax itself. 
The state representation would start with schema-less  XML, followed by schema-compliant XML and JSON
The POST/PUT operations and transactions will be addressed in a separate task.
