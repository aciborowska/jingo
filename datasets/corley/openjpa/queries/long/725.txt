When trying to map a oneToOne relationship using a JoinTable it complains:

[9/16/08 9:29:59:932 PDT] 00000029 SystemErr     R <openjpa-1.0.1-r420667:592145 fatal user error> org.apache.openjpa.persistence.ArgumentException: You have supplied columns for "com.sscims.im.entity.Ecase.sourceEmail<element:class java.lang.Object>", but this mapping cannot have columns in this context.

Here is an example from Hibernate of what I am trying to do:

	@OneToOne
    @JoinTable(
            name="ct_email_msg",
            joinColumns=
{
                @JoinColumn(name="email_entity_type", referencedColumnName="'ecaseEmail'"),
                @JoinColumn(name="email_entity_id", referencedColumnName="ecase_id"),
                @JoinColumn(name="email_type", referencedColumnName="'" + CtEmailMsg.TYPE_RECEIVED + "'")
            }
,
            inverseJoinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="entity_attachment_id", referencedColumnName="entity_attachment_id")   
        )	
	public CtEmailMsg getSourceEmail() 
{
		return sourceEmail;
	}


Basically I have a join table (reference table) that has a three column primary key.  But it has a oneToOne relationship to another object, so I need to be able to join to it from my parent entity.
