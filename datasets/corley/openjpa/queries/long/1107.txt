Per the JPA 2.0 specification, a TraversableResolver must be provided in order to meet the validation criteria outlined in section 3.6.1.2 of the 3/13/09 draft.

The validator instance that is used for automatic validation upon lifecycle events must use a TraversableResolver
that has the following behavior:
• Attributes that have not been loaded must not be loaded.
• Entity associations (single-valued or multi-valued) must not be traversed.

These requirements guarantee that no unloaded attribute or association will be loaded by side effect and
that no entity will be validated more than once.
Embeddable attributes must be validated only if the Valid annotation has been specified on them.
It is the responsibility of the persistence provider to pass an instance implementing the javax.validation.
TraversableResolver interface to the Bean Validation provider by calling ValidatorFactory.
