openjpa-lib will not build on Java 6, presumably because of the inclusion of JDBC 4 which changes the interfaces. Compilation fails with errors such as:

openjpa-lib\src\main\java\org\apache\openjpa\lib\jdbc\DelegatingStatement.java:[34,7] org.apache.openjpa.lib.jdbc.DelegatingStatement is not abstract and does not override abstract method isPoolable() in java.sql.Statement
