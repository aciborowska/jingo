Problem reported by Ngo, Anh (full description with attachments can be found in openjpa-dev mails, subject title: xml store help?

In evaluating openJPA to use for our current project.  It works fine for our need with database.  But I am having problem with the XMLStoreManager.  I have two simple objects - Customer and User.  Customer can have multiple users.  I look at the object store in xml file.  It stored like this:



<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<extent>

    <object class="net.iss.mss.jpa.examples.remedy.Customer" oid="1" version="0">

        <field name="customerId">

            "1"

        </field>

        <field name="customerName">

            "customer1"

        </field>

        <field name="users">

            <element>

                org.apache.openjpa.util.StringId:1

            </element>

            <element>

                org.apache.openjpa.util.StringId:2

            </element>

        </field>

    </object>

</extent>



Shoud the Users element store User object?  The XMLStoreManager failed to load data in because it doest not know how to create this object:                org.apache.openjpa.util.StringId:1



Please help...
