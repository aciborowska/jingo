I'm proposing that we change the default behavior for the DataCache.  Currently, the DataCache is turned off by default.  Our competition is turning on their L2 cache by default.  Thus, out-of-the-box comparisons are killing us.  We have to explain the difference, get them to change the configuration one way or the other for apples-to-apples comparisons, and then re-run the benchmark.  By that time, it's too late.  We already lost.

Due to the upcoming 2.0.0 release, it seems like a good time to change this default.  Please comment directly to this JIRA.

Thanks,
Kevin
