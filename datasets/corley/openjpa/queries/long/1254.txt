The L2 Cache tests are sprinkled through out the current test packages.  And, the configuration of which cache implementation to use is done by modifying code.  With the recent introduction of the EHCache plugin and other potential plugin implementations, it would be nice to have a subset of tests that are easily configurable for a new plugin.  This is not meant to be a comprehensive set of tests, but this can be used as a sniff test to ensure basic execution.
