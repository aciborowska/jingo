This is currently the recommended way to access the javax.sql.Connection underlying an EntityManager:

        OpenJPAEntityManager oem = OpenJPAPersistence.cast(em);
        Connection con = (Connection) oem.getConnection();

It would be more convenient to simply write

        Connection con = em.unwrap(Connection.class);

That way, the client needing to access the Connection only depends on the javax.persistence API and not on org.apache.openjpa.*.

I believe the JPA 2.0 spec neither mandates nor forbids this functionality. It is supported by Eclipselink 2.x.
