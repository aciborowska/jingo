While executing the query: SELECT t FROM TestOpenJpaPO AS t WHERE t.nodeType  in :nodeType

i have noticed at OPENJPA logs that the query is not cached due to the fact that contains the IN expression.

Query "SELECT t FROM TestOpenJpaPO AS t WHERE t.nodeType  in :nodeType" is not cached because it uses IN expression with variable-length parameter..


Is there a reason for this? I guess it might affect performance. 

Can you please include this type of JPQL queries in the cache?
