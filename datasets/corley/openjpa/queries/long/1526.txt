After moving to the JDK 6 and Derby 10.5.3.0, we are experiencing a regression on one of our testcases.  This only happens with the IBM JDK.  Sun and Apple JDKs seem to work just fine.

I've filed this JIRA against Derby:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-4558

We will disable this testcase until the Derby issue gets resolved.
