The L2 Cache used by OpenJPA is includes all available entities by default. The only way to exclude an entity is to modify the entity source code to include the @DataCache annotation and set the value to false. 

Recent drafts of the JPA specification v2.0 define the expected behavior (opt-in, opt-out, etc) some updates may need to be made to ensure compliance when the spec finalizes.
