I'm still working on a testcase to demonstrate this, but the basic steps are roughly like this:

1. Create a Query with a parameter for a primitive type field (e.g., long fooId)
2. Pass in a null for that parameter.
3. Execute the query.  OpenJPA correctly complains that a null has been passed for a primitive type field...

but once the EntityManager closes, it seems to hang forever.

If I can get a TestCase together that demonstrates this problem, I'll attach it.
