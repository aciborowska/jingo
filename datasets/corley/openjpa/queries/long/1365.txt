This issue occurs if the proposed fix for OPENJPA-894 is in place. Without that fix there results of a JOIN FETCH are always distinct when obtained from the database or non-distinct when returned from the persistence context's L1 cache. 

I started a discussion on this topic on the dev mailing list. The entire thread can be seen on Nabble here : http://n2.nabble.com/How-should-we-handle-the-JPQL-DISTINCT-keyword-td3908400.html#a3908400
