According to JPA v2 specification page 48, the joining table should have two columns. One column should have foreign key to owners table and the other should have foreign key to the inverse table. 

The name of the column referencing the owner should be:

	the name of the relationship property or field of inverse entity ;
	underscore "_";
	the name of the primary key column in owner table.



OpenJPA assumes that the name of  the column referencing the owner is:

	owner entity name ;
	underscore "_";
	the name of the primary key column in owner table.



The name of the column referencing the inverse is correct.

Example entities:
@Entity
@Table(name="tblMtmOwner")
public class MtmOwner {
  @Id
  private long id;
  private String name;
  @ManyToMany
  private Collection<MtmInverse> inverses = new ArrayList<MtmInverse>();
}

@Entity
public class MtmInverse{
  @Id
  private long id;
  @ManyToMany(mappedBy="inverses")
  @MapKey(name="name")
  private Map<String, MtmOwner> owners = new HashMap<String, MtmOwner>();
}

Expected column name: owners_id
OpenJPA column name: mtmowner_id
