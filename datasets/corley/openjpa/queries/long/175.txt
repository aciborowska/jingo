The PagingResultObjectProvider during initialization does checks to determine the appropriate pageSize. While this logic caps the size to 50 and addresses determining an appropriate page size, it doesn't always conform to the set batch size. For example with the size being 1000 and FetchBatchSize set to say 500, the page size is determined to be 50 resulting in eager selects happening in batches of 50 when the user expects it to be in batches of 500.
