Now that we have to only support Java 6 in OpenJPA 2.x, there is discussion about revisiting the issue of removing or limiting the use of the ConcreteClassGenerator. This was originally discussed in OpenJPA-1520 [1].  This would help cleanup some of the code and would hopefully result in some performance gains, despite that it didn't seem to help with earlier primitive tests.
