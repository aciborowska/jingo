When using GenerationType.IDENTITY, statement batching is automatically disabled.  Even if a user specifically sets the batch limit, batching is automatically disabled.  This is not documented in OpenJPA documentation.  I will use this JIRA to document this caveat.  I propose that this caveat be documented along with the other IDENTITY caveats listed in documentation here:

Thanks,
