We have no code that tests the utility main method in TableJDBCSeq.  I was unsuccessful in using this method.  The new anchors configuration logic appears to be the problem.  Also possible that the syntax message for this method is in error.  As it stands now, providing no command line parameters does not result in a syntax message.  Instead no output is created.
