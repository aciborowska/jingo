Mapped superclass ignore any attributes declared for it. In the attached example, the person class should expose only the names fields - however, all fields are used when doing the query. Asking for Vets, results in:

org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaSystemException: Column not found: T0.ADDRESS in statement [SELECT t0.id, t0.address, t0.city, t0.FIRST_NAME, t0.LAST_NAME, t0.telephone FROM VETS t0 ORDER BY t0.LAST_NAME ASC, t0.FIRST_NAME ASC] 
{SELECT t0.id, t0.address, t0.city, t0.FIRST_NAME, t0.LAST_NAME, t0.telephone FROM VETS t0 ORDER BY t0.LAST_NAME ASC, t0.FIRST_NAME ASC}

Note that city, address and telephone are not mapped.
