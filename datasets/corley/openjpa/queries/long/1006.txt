An application has a configuration that allows query caching, but is making runtime calls to inform a fetch plan to disable query caching.

The bug is that this dynamic no-caching request is being ignored by the query cache executor, which then caches the query regardless.

Tried to disable query cache using 
OpenJPAEntityManager.getFetchPlan().setQueryResultCache(false);

and also 

query.getFetchPlan().setQueryResultCacheEnabled(false);
