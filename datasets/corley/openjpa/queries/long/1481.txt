Without metadata preload on, my application is working fine. When I turned on metadata preload, creating the factory fails with an error like this:

-------------------
Caused by: <openjpa-1.2.2-r422266:898935 fatal user error> org.apache.openjpa.persistence.ArgumentException: "com.att.ecom.dynamiccontent.domain.pricelist.PriceListFolder.childItems<element:class com.att.ecom.dynamiccontent.domain.pricelist.PriceList>" declares a column that is not compatible with the expected type "blob".  Column details:
Full Name: DCS_PRICE_LIST.PRICE_LIST_ID
Type: varchar
Size: 255
Default: null
Not Null: false
-------------------

This error message is from the unit test output, which uses Derby.  My application normally uses Oracle.  The only difference in the error message between the unit test with Derby and at runtime with Oracle is the type is "varchar2" (Derby only has varchar).

The excerpt from the orm.xml for this property is this:

            <id name="id">
                <column name="PRICE_LIST_ID"/>
            </id>

And from the domain class:

    @Id
    private String          id;

I'm going to attach the "TEST" output file from the build which shows the error message and stack trace.  I'm also going to attach a zip file containing an Eclipse project, but the "lib" and "libtest" directories will only have a "jars.lst" text file containing the names of the jars that were in that directory (almost all of which have a version number in the name).  Note that not all of the jars in those lists are required for the unit test to complete.  Some of the jars in the list are required for the CXF and Spring portion of the application, so wouldn't be necessary for this test case.
