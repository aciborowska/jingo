I have my base class inheritance set to
@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS), what I expected was
that each subsequent subclass would use the same strategy by default. What I
find is that this inheritance strategy only seems to be inherited by the
first subclass but not the subsequence subclasses.  For example:

BaseClass  - Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)

Class Sub1 extends BaseClass   - table per class functions without the need
to anote the class 

Class Sub2 extends Sub1  -  reverts to using single table unless anoted with
.TABLE_PER_CLASS
