I've been annoyed for quite some time that when I want to use the DataCache I need to configure it in two steps. One to turn on the DataCache(obviously), and the second is to enable a RemoteCommitProvider. 
     <property name="openjpa.DataCache" value="true(CacheSize=10000)"/>
     <property name="openjpa.RemoteCommitProvider" value="sjvm" />

With this JIRA I'm proposing that when the DataCache is enabled we auto configure the sjvm RCP if there isn't one already there.
