Only the current release should appear on the ASF mirrors.
This is to reduce the disk space requirements for the mirror system.

It takes a few days for all mirrors to catch up with a new release, but after a suitable period (e.g. a week) any superseded releasese should be deleted from:

http://www.apache.org/dist/openjpa/

In some cases, projects maintain several release series (e.g. Tomcat6 and Tomcat7) in which case only the latest of each series should remain on the mirror system.

AFAICT, the following releases are no longer current and should be removed:

2.1.0
2.1.1
2.2.0

Older releases are always available from archive.apache.org.
