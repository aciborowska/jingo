In the general case, configuration properties have constraints on values they can have. Some of these constraints are implemented today, for example enumeration of possible values for a given property of type enumeration. However, other properties, like lockTimeout of type integer do not (yet) have constraints defined and implemented that can be checked against.

For example, when the lockTimeout property is set it is undefined currently what permissible values are. The default is -1, but is -2 a possible value? Is 0 a possible value? Are all the natural numbers possible values?

What would be required is a validate() method that given an intended value for a property returns true/false indicating if the provided value for the property is a valid one. If this is done uniformly across all properties it is possible to check the property's value for consistency before attempting deployment.
