Hi,

We have discovered a bug in OpenJPA when InverseManager is used with collection annoted @toMany([...], optional = false). OpenJPA doesn't solve inverse relations before calling the internal preflush method.

This bug does not exist on versions 2.1.0 and 2.1.1.

A unitary test and a small patch is worth a thousand words  [1]

[1] Patch successfully tested on OpenJPA 2.2.1 and in our software.

Regards,
