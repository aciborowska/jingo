We're seeing builds fail with OOM PermGen space when using 64bit Sun JDK6 (but not IBM SDK 6) on Linux (but not MacOSX.)

1) updating the test.jvm.arguments and surefire.jvm.args in the pom.xml files
2) users and automated build servers will need to update their MAVEN_OPTS if they want to build with a 64bit JVM
