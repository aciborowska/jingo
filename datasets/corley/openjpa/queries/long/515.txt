Data partitioning is adopted as a strategy in many real-life data-intensive applications. Extensible architecture of  OpenJPA can be leveraged to build an extension module that allows applications to transact and collate data from multiple database slices without any change to application program. 
To explore this possibility, a new module named 'openjpa-slice'  is added for community feedback. 

This report is created as an umbrella for discussion around distributed database support in OpenJPA.
