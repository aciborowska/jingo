Currently, our getter method logic (enhanced byte code plus our statemanager code) has some unnecessary overhead when processing fields that have already been loaded.  We're looking at streamlining that processing by using a simple check in the beforeRead method to determine if the field has already been loaded.  If it has, then just return and let it return the value already present.  If it has not been loaded, then we'll go through the normal processing.
