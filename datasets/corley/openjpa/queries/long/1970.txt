CPU is spinning forever at TreeMap.get in schema.java.
The reason found to be because of structural modification of treemap outside a synchronized block.
Synchronizing the treemap is fixing the issue.
The issue can be reproduced with an openJPA test case but due to the nature of the problem, it is replicable intermittently on dual core machine.
Attached patch has the test case and also the test case is ignored in default runs because it will cause the tests to stuck at TreeMap.get.

This is seen in 1.1.x version of openJPA and hence uploading the patch only for that version.
