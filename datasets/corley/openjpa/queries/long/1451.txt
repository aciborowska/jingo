The standard @Version -based optimistic locking in JPA is too much limited in many cases. Often you need to have optimistic lock more column(cell)-level then record-level based. It can be accomplished by using old value of the modified column(s) in WHERE clause, instead of using @Version column. Other JPA implementations already provide such extensions, it would be good if OpenJPA had it too.

E.g. in Hibernate it'd done by: @org.hibernate.annotations.Entity(optimisticLock=DIRTY)
and in EclipseLink: @org.eclipse.persistence.annotations.OptimisticLocking(type=CHANGED_COLUMNS)
