Rollback is not complete under the following circumstances:

1. Entites must use a sequence generator with GenerationType.SEQUENCE
2. It is the first rollback after application start
3. You have to flush successfully during the creation of entities
4. The transaction is rolled back during commit because of a constraint violation

Expected result: Nothing remains in the database that is created during the transaction

Actual result: Entites created before the flush are persisted (i.e. not rolled back)

An example project is attached. It shows the described problem when executing the test.
