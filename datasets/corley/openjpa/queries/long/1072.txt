When working with embeddables I found that if I define a unidirectional @ManyToOne relationship from an embeddable to an Entity which has a generated id, the relationship in the join table doesn't get persisted. I'll attach a zip with my code, but I'll also try to describe the scenario here.

Entities: 
Seller - Has an auto generated ID and a name
Book - Has an id(isbn) and an ElementCollection of Listings
Listing - An embeddable that has a ManyToOne relationship to Seller, a price and comments.

The scenario is as follows:

	Create all the sellers.
	Create a book.
	Add a listing to each book. Each listing takes a Seller Entity and a price.
	When I commit the book, the seller_id column in my Listing join table is always zero.
