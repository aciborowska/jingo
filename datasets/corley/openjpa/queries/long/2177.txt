If an abstract entity class (marked as @MappedSuperclass) is extended by a concrete entity class and the abstract entity is not include in the persistence.xml as a managed class, OpenJPA incorrectly maps the entity fields.  

Based on the SQL trace messages, it would appear that there are two different internal arrays representing the entity fields.  The StateManagerImpl._metafield contains an array of all fields on the given entity.  However, when the actual field data is fetched, a different backing array of fields is used and it does not match the _metafield array.  As a result, the wrong field is updated/fetched. 

Attached is a simple maven/junit test case.
