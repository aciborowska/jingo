Provided we have a model with a master entity and a collection of dependent elements marked with @DependentElement annotation. When a master entity is loaded, changed (without changes on the depoendent elements and without deleting the references to them) and then (redundantly) merged, then the dependent elements are deleted upon the transaction commit.
