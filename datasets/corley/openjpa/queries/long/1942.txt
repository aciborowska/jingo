I switched the JDBCConfiguration to use openjpa.jdbc.SchemaFactory=native(ForeignKeys=true) as the default setting, ran a build, and found that many jUnits are failing.  There are many failures in the o-p-j module, but they look to be caused by 3 or 4 main problems.  This task is to identify the issues and:

a) correct any jUnit related problems under this sub-task
b) open sub-tasks for failures caused by code bugs
