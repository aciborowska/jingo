Take the following two entities:

@Entity
public class DepartmentTest{	
    @Id
    private String primaryKey;

    @OrderBy("name")
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "departmentTest")
     private Set<PersonTest> persons = new HashSet<PersonTest>();
...........

@Entity
public class PersonTest  {
	@Id
	private String primaryKey;

	@ManyToOne
        @ForeignKey
	private DepartmentTest departmentTest;

        private String name;
.....

With these entities, take this JPQL:

"SELECT DISTINCT dept FROM DepartmentTest dept LEFT JOIN FETCH dept.persons";

Depending on the data in the database (the order is important, see the provided test), this query can return a results set where some of the 'persons' are missing.
