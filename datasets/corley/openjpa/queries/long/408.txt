From the parent Issue...

o I think the "unsupported" option for the openjpa.RuntimeUnenhancedClasses property is hiding a more meaningful message. For example, if I run with "warn" option, I get the warning message (runtime-optimization-disabled) and a null is returned. In this scenario, the processing continues and then I get this message:

<openjpa-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT-r420667:573398M nonfatal user error>
org.apache.openjpa.persistence.ArgumentException: Attempt to cast instance "..." to
PersistenceCapable failed. Ensure that it has been enhanced.

But, if I run with the "unsupported" option, then the only message I get is the (runtime-optimization-disabled) exception. Although it still indicates an error exists, it's not as clear as the "PersistenceCapable" message. Not sure if we should re-think the "warn" vs "unsupported" argument, or maybe just an update to the message text for (runtime-optimization-disabled).
