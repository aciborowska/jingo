This is a subtask for OPENJPA-637 to provide a configuration option that allows selection of the cache store implementation used for data caching.  Minimally, it should provide a choice between the new java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap-based implementation and the legacy/1.0.x OpenJPA ConcurrentHashMap.  Documentation will be needed to explain the behavioral differences between the options and environments where one option may be a more ideal choice over the other.
