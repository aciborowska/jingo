When running the mapping tool (though IJ's Maven integration and the OpenJPA Maven plugin, goal openjpa:sql), the tool seems to get confused by two things:

1. If there is a single persistence unit in persistence.xml, it will ignore the schema name if there is only a schema parameter in the annotation:
@Table(schema = "foo")
@Entity
public class Bar {
}

Will generate the SQL that is not correctly scoped for schema foo. If there is both a schema name and a table name:
@Table(schema = "foo", name = "baz")
@Entity
public class Bar {
}

The generated sql will be correct (i.e. foo.baz)

2. If persistence.xml contains two PUs (let's say foo and bar in that order), all generated tables appear to be scoped to bar and none to foo despite annotations to the contrary.
