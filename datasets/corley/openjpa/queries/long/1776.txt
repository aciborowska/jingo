Distribution Policy was designed to determined the target slice when an instance enters the managed life-cycle. If an instance determines its target slice based on its related instances then these relations may not be assigned at the time of persist(). Hence this change will allow the distribution policy to delay this decision until the instance is being actually flushed to the datastore (as by then all relations should be assigned).
