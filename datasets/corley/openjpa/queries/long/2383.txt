As described in (old) OPENJPA-128, the org.apache.openjpa.meta.AbstractCFMetaDataFactory class can't detect directories right, causing XML parsing errors.

Users can workaround the issue by adding <exclude-unlisted-classes>true</exclude-unlisted-classes> to their persistence.xml files (recommended) or exploding deployments.
