I have been testing OpenJPA 2.4.1 with our product for 6 months. We are about to distribute the product to out UAT, and found out that the links for downloading apache-openjpa-2.4.1-binary.zip on http://openjpa.apache.org/downloads.html are broken. Is there another reliable source we can use to download 2.4.1, or the broken links are just temporary? 

Thank you for your help!
