The TestQueryMultithreaded testcase for Slice will occasionally hang during a build. The problem appears more frequently with multi-core CPUs and with the Hudson builds which deploy to the Apache Snapshot repository.

In any event the testcase cannot be reliably executed - with a likely root cause being in the openjpa.Multithreaded configuration option.
