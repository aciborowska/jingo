We're currently building a Cassandra adapter for OpenJPA.  In doing so we've encountered an issue that I think may be a bug.  We have our test cases and source available here.

https://github.com/riptano/hector-jpa/blob/master/src/test/java/com/datastax/hectorjpa/store/ManyToManyIndexTest.java

Essentially, the test constructs the following relationships.


User A one-many> Observe -many-one-> User B

Essentially our test models what is functionally a many-many with additional meta.

When CassandraStoreManager.flush is called only UserA and Observe are in the pNew collection.  Where User A, Observer and User B should be in pNew since all cascade on persist.
