David Wisneski reported [1] several scenarios where application behaves differently on whether DataCache is active or not. DataCache should, according to the user manual and design intent, have no impact on application behavior other than giving it a performance boost. However, there are corner cases where an application may observe different behavior based on whether DataCache is active or not. This issue is opened to identify these corner cases, if any, through a set of test cases.
