Narrowing SQL Exception to a more specific exception such as lock or query or referential integrity violation does not distinguish correctly whether a query or lock request has timed out. 
This distinction is critical for JPA 2.0 spec compliance because QueryTimeOut and LockTimeOut exceptions are not supposed to cause rollback as per the spe (Section 3.9).
