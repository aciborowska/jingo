I've started some documentation on the Wiki OpenJPA Eclipse Tooling, see URL(s) in OPENJPA-1412.

Once I've completed at least a basic first round, some other have verified it, and it has a final location (on the OpenJPA instead of the Test Wiki), it may make sense to have the User's Guide 3. Reference Guide / Chapter 5.  Persistent Classes  / 2.  Enhancement mention this option?
