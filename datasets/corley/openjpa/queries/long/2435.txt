I've recreated an issue where a @Version field is returned as an Integer when the field is defined as a Long or Short.  To explain, lets take this entity:

@Entity
public class LongVersionEntity implements Serializable {
.......
    @Version
    protected Long version;
.......

With this entity take the following query:

String str = "SELECT o.id, o.version FROM LongVersionEntity o";
Query query = em.createQuery(str);
List<Object[]> objectList = query.getResultList();
for (Object[] objects : objectList) {
    objects[1].getClass() //Will return Integer.

Notice in this query we are selecting the version field.  When iterating over the results, we will find that objects[1].getClass() will return Integer, rather than Long.  The same seems to be true for the other supported types, except for Timestamp.
I will provide a full test in the next day or so.

Thanks,

Heath
