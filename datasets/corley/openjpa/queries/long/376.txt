As we are debugging problems in an application server environment (ie. WebSphere), it is becoming apparent that we need more trace output when demarcating transaction begin/commit/rollback.  I have had to debug several problems relating to whether data updates were actually pushed out to the database or not.  Without turning on additional trace mechanisms in other software components (WebSphere, the database itself, the application, etc), it's impossible to tell what OpenJPA is processing as far as the transaction is concerned.  This becomes increasingly important when dealing with multiple clients and multiple transactions and knowing what gets processed in what order.

Question:  What trace channel should I use?  Should I go with the general openjpa.Runtime channel?  Or, should I create a new channel (openjpa.Transaction)?  Seems like overkill.  But, if people are concerned about the amount of trace data, we could go this route.  Suggestions?
