We hit a problem that OpenJPA always rounds to the nearest 10ms for PostgreSQL. We found the following old issue in which a workaround got outlined in OPENJPA-433

But still the question remains: PostgreSQL is perfectly fine to store milliseconds, so why does the PostgresDictionary line 146 sets:
> datePrecision = CENTI;
?

The generated TIMESTAMP type in PostgreSQL should even be able to store microseconds! [1]
And that seems to be the case since quite some time now (1999) [2].

I'm really tempted to set this to MICRO; Anyone against it?
