If a derived product has specified a setLoadKey() for a property, that property is returned in the getSupportedProperties(). A test case with wsjpa has shown this. For example, wsjpa.AutoClear is returned instead of openjpa.AutoClear. It's up to a derived product to determine which properties it supports, in addition to or in replacement of the openjpa-prefixed properties. So, this method should only return spec-defined properties and properties prefixed with openjpa.
