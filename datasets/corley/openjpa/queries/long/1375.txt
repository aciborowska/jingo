Long stress run in the app server/container environment caused a OutOfMemoery exception with a heap dump that showed the following:

 FetchConfigurationImpl$ConfigurationState
 + WsJpaFetchConfigurationImpl
    + Array of Object
       + IdentityHashMap
          + EntityManagerImpl

What happened is the container pooled the entity manager and clear the context when a transaction is completed. However the IdentityHashMap in EntityManagerImpl, which maps the fetch configuration to fetch plan, is not being flush/clear. This caused the growth of the IdentityHashMap and eventually the OOM in a long run.
