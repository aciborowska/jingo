When an entity contains 2 or more relationships (ex: @ManyToOne), each with a type of the same entity, and a foreign key table is generated with each of them as an id, 1 or more of the id values are wrong.

The problem occurs in ValueMappingImpl where the getForeignKey() method always grabs the first one that matches the type.
