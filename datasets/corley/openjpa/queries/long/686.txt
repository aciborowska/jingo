Applications performing update/insert data of the BigDecimal java type may fail with OptimisticException if the the 
data exceeds the scale or precision of the db column on Sybase,. 

The Sybase behavior is working as documented, as shown in the following link:
http://manuals.sybase.com/onlinebooks/group-as/asg1250e/sqlug/@Generic__BookTextView/3524;pt=693/* 

In Openjpa, it is not possible to specify precision/scale for the column mapped by a BigDecimal type. 
However, applications can specify the plugin value for the column type mapped by the BigDecimal java type:
http://openjpa.apache.org/docs/latest/manual/manual.html#openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary
to avoid this trunction error problem. 

It is desirable to update the "database restrictions" section of the openjpa manual for this Sybase-specific trunction problem.
