Reading the Slices documentation, it looks like you should be able to configure a UserName/Password for each slice, but in reality it doesn't support that.  It only supports one UserName/Password globally:

So you can't do:

> openjpa.slice.Slice1.ConnectionPassword=########
> openjpa.slice.Slice1.ConnectionUserName=dbuser_protrade
> openjpa.slice.Slice2.ConnectionPassword=########
> openjpa.slice.Slice2.ConnectionUserName=dbuser_protrade

You can only do:

> openjpa.slice.ConnectionPassword=########
> openjpa.slice.ConnectionUserName=dbuser_protrade



So.. it looks like slices does not support a username/password per slice.  It requires a global username/password.  And the documentation doesn't make it clear at all.  You might want to review that section again.  And make it really clear that you HAVE to define global username/password.

If you look for "Properties:", you'll see two of them.  The first one loads up a normal non-slice database.  The second loads up the slices.  The Properties for the first one has ConnectionURL, ConnectionUserName, ConnectionPassword, while the one for slices does not.
