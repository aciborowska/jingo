I am using hedwig as a notification system for my webapp. However, the current version of hedwig does not have any api for deleting topics. Since I want to be able to manage the resources, I tried to "delete" a topic by removing the znodes associated with the topic. However, the hubs do not lose their ownership of their delete topics until the redistribution period (e.g., lazy cleanup). The hubs will behave as if they still own the topic, which has no information in zookeeper server(s). I am hoping to see a hedwig-client api that does eager delete. 

As of now, the system is unthrottled and thus can grow without bound. This poses a threat where my resources can run out by malicious use cases, rogue programmers, etc.
