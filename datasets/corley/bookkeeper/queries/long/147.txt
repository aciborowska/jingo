Take the case of 2 regions, rA & rB and a topic T, and a mobile subscriber, s1. s1 could be a phone or a tablet etc.

s1 subscribes to T on rA at time X. s1 moves location, so that rB is now it's local region. s1 subscribes to T on rB (the connection to rA was lost while moving) at time Y.
Any messages published to T in the period between X and Y, if they have not been sent to s1 will not be sent to s1.
