for performance consideration, the jira is targeting on improving ledger recovery. this ticket is to track improvements:


	add a parallel reading request in PendingReadOp (so when we read range of requests, we could callback individual entry if they are available)
	change recovery read to use batch read, so we could parallel reading entries to improve recovery time.
