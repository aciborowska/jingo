There are a couple of problematic cases to deal with:
i)Other region is pushing messages faster that my bookkeeper can handle it (unlikely, but we should have an answer for
this setting)
ii) If there is an error from BK while persisting messages, we cannot continue (because the ordering gurantee might be
violated). In this case, the BK layer should give up the topic.

To retain ordering guarantees, this should be done below the Region manager in the persistence manager layer
