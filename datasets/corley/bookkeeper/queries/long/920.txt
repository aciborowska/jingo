We should add more information to the Jira ticket when merging a github PR. 
Currently, the update on the Jira contains only the author and commit title. It would be good to also have:

	Author
	Committer
	Reviewers (Better if we automatically read the '+1' from the PR comments)



In addition, we should add the option to run the tests locally on the merged PR before pushing to apache git. 
Recently we had cases of PRs which were fine on their own, but then tests started failing after merging into master (because of other commits since), even without git merge conflicts.
