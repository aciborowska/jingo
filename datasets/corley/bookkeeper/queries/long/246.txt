This JIRA is to decide how to record that entries in a ledger are underreplicated. 

I think there is a common understanding (correct me if im wrong), that rereplication can be broken into two logically distinct phases. A) Detection of entry underreplication & B) Rereplication. 

This subtask is to handle the interaction between these two stages. Stage B needs to know what to rereplicate; how should Stage A inform it?
