Ledger length can be inconsistent if a ledger is closed by a writing client that encounters an error. For example, in a cluster with 3 bookies, and an ledger with a q3e3 configuration, if a bookie dies, the client will close the ledger when it fails to write an entry. However, it has already added the length of the failed entry to the local ledger length, and this is what is stored to zk.
