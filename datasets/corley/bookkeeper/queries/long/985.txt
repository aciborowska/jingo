with  BOOKKEEPER-966 we have a better way to pass options from the command line.
A further enhancement will be to let the user pass any other configuration option and system property from the command line.
Something like

BookeServer -x option1=value1 -x option2=value2 -Djava.security.auth.login.config=jaas.conf



This change will enable to support new properties without changing the code of the CLI
