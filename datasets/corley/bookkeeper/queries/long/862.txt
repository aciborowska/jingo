Porting a change form the Twitter branch to improve stats and logging in OrderedSafeExecutor
These changes have been helpful for us in debugging latency issues in Bookkeeper server/client 
Summary of changes is

	add a config option for op stats
	add stats for task execution time, task pending time
	add a config option for logging a warning when an op takes longer than x micros
	add toString implementations for submitted tasks so make it easier to track down slow ops
	start using Builder for OrderedSafeExecutor
	add a very simple test to make sure that the slow op logging path is exercised



Most of this came from Sijie originally, with some changes from me
