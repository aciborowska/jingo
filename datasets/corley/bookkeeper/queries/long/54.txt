1. As we know, when stopDelivery, the messageHandler will be set to null.
2. We also know that in SubscribeReconnectCallback.operationFinished(), we will check if the messageHandler is null, if messageHandler is not null, we will startDelivery.

Both the reconnect thread and the main thread will race the messageHandler. For example,
the reconnect handler checked that messageHandler is not null, and will startDelivery, then main thread  exec stopDelivery, set messageHandler to null, and then reconnect thread exec startDelivery, set messageHandler back again. so although the client app stopDelivery, it still can receive message.
