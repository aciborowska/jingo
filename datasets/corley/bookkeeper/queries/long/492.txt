To make sure all servers adopt consistent settings on some parameters (such as LedgerManagerFactory), we leverage zookeeper for coordination. And as there are more settings (MetaStoreImplClass in MSLedgerManagerFactory and MsMetadataManagerFactory, LedgerIdGeneratorClass etc) needs to make similar global consistent guarantee, a common interface to do this job would make things easier.
