Some tests, GcLedgerTests for example, create a lot of ledgers (30k) which causes a lot of zk writes. This causes a lot of zk logging, which can fill the log buffer and cause an oom when you're running with very little memory.

Fix is trivial. zk should be set to only log at error level in log4j.properties.
