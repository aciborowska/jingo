Currently all the code for interleaved ledger storage is in the bookie package. Likewise, the tests are in the bookie package. This makes it unclear what is a test of the ledger storage and what is a test of the bookie in general.

This JIRA is to move both of these into a subpackage of bookie, o.a.b.bookie.ills. BOOKKEEPER-432 will then go into o.a.b.bookie.sls, and each of the tests in the ills package will have a corresponding test in sls.
