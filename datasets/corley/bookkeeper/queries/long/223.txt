PendingReadOp tries to read all entries from the bookie ensemble at once, and fill an enumeration with what comes back. This is bad. If we have a ledger with millions of entries, and you try to read the whole thing, you're client will crap out. Of course you can get around this by only requesting a little bit at a time, but why doesn't the client do this for you, as we are effectively exposing a iterator interface anyhow?
