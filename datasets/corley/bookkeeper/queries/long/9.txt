BookKeeper currently has a flat namespace hierarchy. Applications usually need a namespace for storing ledgers and it will be really nice to have that as part of BookKeeper itself. It is really easy to provide a namespace for applications for BookKeeper since it already needs ZooKeeper to store ledger entries, otherwise applications written on top of BookKeeper have to store the namespace somewhere else.
