Shutdown called from here

 if (!shuttingdown) {
            // some error found in journal thread and it quits
            // following add operations to it would hang unit client timeout
            // so we should let bookie server exists
            LOG.error("Journal manager quits unexpectedly.");
            shutdown(ExitCode.BOOKIE_EXCEPTION);
        }
