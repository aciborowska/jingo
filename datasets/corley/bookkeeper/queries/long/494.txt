Currently we had Cookie for each bookie to record the directories it used for ledgers. So when the admin wants to add a new disk for a bookie, we can't change the configuration and restart it simply. an admin command would be added to help admin guys adding a new disk to a bookie and upgrading its Cookie.

Adding a brand new disk would be quite easy. But if we want to remove a disk or replace a disk, it isn't trivial. BOOKKEEPER-201 would take care of removing/replace a disk.
