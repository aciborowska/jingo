I'm getting the following warning when building the project:


:hedwig-server fpj$ mvn clean
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[WARNING]

[WARNING] It is highly recommended to fix these problems because they threaten the stability of your build.

[WARNING] For this reason, future Maven versions might no longer support building such malformed projects.

Note that this is only for hedwig-server.
