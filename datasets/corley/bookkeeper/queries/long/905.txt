Enhance Bookkeeper shell to perform following.
We may open sub-tasks for some of the following if needed.


	Add flush command to bookie shell
	Make bookie shell usable on dev box including using local bookie; so basically we must be able to run bookie specific commands even while using local bookie.
	Multiple formats for ExtentId in bk shell; input/output to take log/hex/uuid formats
	Spit out list of disk files, including index,journal,and ledger files
	enhance readlog command just to take a particular entryId and print that.
