talked with Yidong Cui offline about the feature they proposed to add in BOOKKEEPER-616, it looks like a clear way to do that is to provide a cluster-subscriber, so the cluster delivery logic would be implemented in a ClusterDeliveryEndPoint without touching the core of Hedwig.

this is the master ticket to track the works for this feature.
