This can be reproduced in following steps:
1) client-A created a ledger-x and write N entries to it
2) client-B open the ledger-x and try to read all entries from it. client-B can only get N-1 entries (except for the last entry)

This problem caused by, when trying to open an unclosed ledger, it will enter the "recover" mode, it can get correct last entry-Id judged by the size of log file. But it will set the new opened ledger's lastAddConfirmed by the previous lastAddConfirmed, and the entry-id will be ignored.
For an unclosed ledger, the lastAddConfirmed will always = (last-entry-id - 1).

A patch attached to this jira.
