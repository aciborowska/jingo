I have been running a 4.1-SNAPSHOT build, which last commit was:

commit f694716e289c448ab89cab5fa81ea0946f9d9193
Author: Flavio Paiva Junqueira <fpj@apache.org>
Date:   Tue Apr 3 16:02:44 2012 +0000
BOOKKEEPER-207: BenchBookie doesn't run correctly (ivank via fpj)

And I noticed lots of these lines in the logs:

2012-04-25 11:20:48,422 - ERROR [GarbageCollectorThread:EntryLogger@188] - Trying to delete an entryLog file that could not be found: 0.log
2012-04-25 11:20:48,422 - INFO  [GarbageCollectorThread:GarbageCollectorThread@266] - Deleting entryLogId 1 as it has no active ledgers!
2012-04-25 11:20:48,422 - ERROR [GarbageCollectorThread:EntryLogger@188] - Trying to delete an entryLog file that could not be found: 1.log

I made a new 4.1-SNAPSHOT build yesterday (4/25/2012) and installed it on one of the servers and restart it. Errors remain. I will attach logs. I haven't touched the servers since setup - ie no manual deletion of logs, etc. I do delete legers programmatically using the bookkeeper client (which i believe we're still at 4.0). I have also noticed BkRecoveryExceptions when trying to read ledgers off this cluster:

org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BKException$BKLedgerRecoveryException
	at org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BKException.create(BKException.java:66)
	at org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LedgerHandle.readLastConfirmed(LedgerHandle.java:576)

This exception isn't thrown all the time, but is a very frequent error.
