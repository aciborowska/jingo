In hedwig, messages for a subscription will queue up forever if the subscriber is offline. In some usecases, this is undesirable, as it will eventually mean resource exhaustion. In this JIRA we propose an optional change to the subscription contract, which allows the user to set a bound on the number of messages which will be queued for its subscription while it is offline.
