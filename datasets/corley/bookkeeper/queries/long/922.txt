We have introduced ctime into ledger metadata through https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BOOKKEEPER-879.

In the same token we would like to introduce createrId also. This can be a 128 bit UUID. Caller can write tools to group ledgers by createrId, in the future we can even enhance this to run queries based on createrId.
