We can also have an option to start the Autorecovery along with Bookie servers.
If some users are not having too much load on the servers, they can even start them along the Bookie servers. If they feel, Auditor would disturb Bookie performance, they can anyway start as separate process.

In another case, deployment overhead will reduce a bit as Monitoring process need not monitor one more process in their lifcycles etc.

Thoughts?
