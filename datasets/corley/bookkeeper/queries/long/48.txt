Now each ledger in bookkeeper has separate index file. Publishing messages to new topics needs to create the index file and write a header. So number of files need to be created and written increase when number of ledgers(topics) increase, which slows down disk i/o. 

index file creation and written will slow down getFileInfo operation. Even worse, it lock the whole fileInfoCache, which might affect other bookkeeper operations.

Need a solution not to lock the whole fileInfoCache while creating/written index files.

Some testing results listed as below (3 bookie servers, 2 quorum.)


	Create 
{num_ledgers}
 ledgers, each ledgers publish 2 messages. (make sure index file of a specified ledger are all created in 3 bookie servers)



 num ledgers 
 5,000 
 50,000 
 500,000 


 bookie 
 459.178 
 419.26 
 86.03 








	After publishing 2 messages, publish messages in round-robin way ledger by ledger, until publishing 10,000,000 messages.
