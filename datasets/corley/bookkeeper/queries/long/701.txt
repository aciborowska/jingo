This JIRA discusses how to improve the exception handling of bookkeeper threads. As part of this it needs to review all the bookkeeper threads, if any unhandled exception from a thread, it should,

	log a loud error when a thread dies.
	exit if any of the critical thread dies.



Please have a look at BOOKKEEPER-700 to know the initial discussions.
