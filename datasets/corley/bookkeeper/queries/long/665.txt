If a bookie is not in the available list, we shouldn't try to read from it but just treat the read from that replica as failed.

This could be especially true if the bookie node is partitioned because that could mean we need to wait the connection timeout. Also during the auto-replication of ledgers most of the logs consist of errors that say it was not possible to read from the failed bookie.
