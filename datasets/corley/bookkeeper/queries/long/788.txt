For each release, we need to type a sequence of commands to validate release candidate tag. This process could be achieved by a single script.

Here is the behavior of the script in my mind:
   1. Collecting build environment info (Operation System, JDK, Maven)
   2. Run 'mvn install -DskipTests'
   3. Checking code (findbugs, rat).
   4. Running unit test
   5. Start standalone Bookie and Hedwig service
   6. Run simple Bookie test: bookkeeper-server/bin/bookkeeper simpletest
-ensemble 3 -writeQuorum 3
   7. Run simple Hedwig test: hedwig-server/bin/hedwig console; pubsub
topic subscriber 10 message
   8. Tar all above logs when error/exit

In addition, this script could also be provided to user which could collect related information to diagnose compile/UT failure issue.
