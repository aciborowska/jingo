For application like hbase WAL, it will be useful if application like hbase can give a hint to bk about application's preferred ledger location. In that way, application can fail over to specific machines where one of the ledger replica is located; the recovery time will be faster. Another scenario is hbase's support for hot standby region server where read request can be served from a different machine other than the active region server. That requires the hot standby region server to read from ledger. If the ledger is on the same machine as standby region server, the performance will be better.
