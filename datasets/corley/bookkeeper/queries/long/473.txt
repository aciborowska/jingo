BOOKKEEPER-432 introduced SkipList to sort entries before adding them to entry log file, to improve ledger read performance.

This task is to eliminate/reduce Index files, which contribute to sync write I/O spike (thousands of index files corresponding to active ledgers per bookie server).

The write I/O contend with disk read I/O.
