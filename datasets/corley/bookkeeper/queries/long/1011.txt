One of the feedbacks from 

https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/105#issuecomment-287787603

was that there are some customer APIs that need to be cleaned up.  This is specifically for the two constructors in Bookkeeper


public BookKeeper(ClientConfiguration conf, ZooKeeper zk);
public BookKeeper(ClientConfiguration conf, ZooKeeper zk, ClientSocketChannelFactory channelFactory);



That are really for internal use only.  We should find a way to mark them as such.
