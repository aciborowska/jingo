the compaction test hanging on Jenkins. 

Ivan did some investigation on this issue, and found that it wasn't hanging, it was just taking a really long time. He suggested that it is because it does a lot of I/O, theres a couple of ways we could reduce this.
1. Only create 1 bookie
2. Not inherit from BaseTestCase
3. Reduce the number of entries
