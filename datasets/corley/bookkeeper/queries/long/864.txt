BookKeeper coordinates with ZooKeeper to generate an cluster wide LedgerId. This is a 64 bit number. This method works great because we have ZK acting as a centralized coordinator.  But this method may not scale as the cluster size and number of ledgers increase. 

GUIDs ( (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_unique_identifier) are preferred way to generate decentralized globally unique IDs and it takes 128 bits ; This method can scale well as it doesnâ€™t need a centralized coordination. 
Current BK code used ledgerId as a primary object, any change to this (64 to128 bit) warrants across the board code changes. 

Opening this issue so we can solicit community input and track the progress.
