When a topic is dropped by the owning hub (e.g. due to a regularly scheduled topic relinquishing), subscribers are not
notified.  AbstractSubscriptionManager.lostTopic() simply removes the topic from the local table.  This only prevents
the system from being able to update subscription states for that topic (on consume calls); subscribers remain
oblivious to this fact, as the failed attempts do not result in errors.  ActiveSubscriptionStates furthermore remain
present in the FIFODeliveryManager.

Proposed fix: notify subscribers with an error message so that they know to resubscribe (with whoever the new topic
owner is).
