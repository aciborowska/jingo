Currently, the PR for this package is merged into main stream: https://github.com/mesosphere/universe
And the example PR is also merged into : https://github.com/dcos/examples

Maybe in next release of DCOS, we could use the bookkeeper package directly.

Left this ticket to tracking the following work left, such as the docker image automate update.
Since this version bookkeeper package use a fix version of bookkeeper docker, we need to handle automaticly "update the package as we release new versions"
