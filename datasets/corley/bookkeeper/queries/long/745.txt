The bug occurred because there was no check if rereplication was enabled or not when the auditor came online. When the auditor comes online it does a check of which bookies are up and marks the ledgers on missing bookies as underreplicated. In the false report case, the auditor was running after each bookie was bounced due to the way leader election for the auditor works. And since one bookie was down since you're bouncing the server, all ledgers on that bookie will get marked as underreplicated.
