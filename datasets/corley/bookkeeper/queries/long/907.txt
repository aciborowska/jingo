In ReadLedgerEntriesCmd for printing the contents of the Entry, HexDumpFormat is used by default here, but whereas in ReadJournalCmd/ReadLogCmd StringEntryFormatter is used and it is configurable. We should add HexDumpEntryFormatter just like StringEntryFormatter and use the configured formatter for printing the entry.
