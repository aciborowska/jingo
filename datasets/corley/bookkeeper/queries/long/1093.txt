Currently LAC is only updated when the reader explicitly calls #readLastAddConfirmed(). In tailing-read use cases, it will not wise to keep calling #readLastAddConfirmed, especially when the traffic is huge.

The idea here is piggy-back LAC along with the read responses. so the client will get advanced LAC along with read responses. so it will reduce calling #readLastAddConfirmed.
