Multiple bkclients are allowed to perform operation on same ledger, this violates the SingleWriter contract.

BookieClient is successfully adding entries to the ledger without knowing that another bkclient has come and deleted the ledger itself. Causing serious dataloss to the applications which might be thinking the data would be successfully written to the ledger.
