PendingAddOp is set to completed when it meets ack quorum.

        if (ackSet.addBookieAndCheck(bookieIndex) && !completed) {
            completed = true;

            LOG.debug("Complete (lid:{}, eid:{}).", ledgerId, entryId);
            // when completed an entry, try to send success add callbacks in order
            lh.sendAddSuccessCallbacks();
        }



responses are ignored after completed flag is set.

       if (completed) {
            // I am already finished, ignore incoming responses.
            // otherwise, we might hit the following error handling logic, which might cause bad things.
            return;
        }



It is not a correctness problem, but it would introduce performance issue during ensemble change. A callback (could be acknowledge before ensemble change) has to be delayed to ensemble change completion.
