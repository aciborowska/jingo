The ManagedLedger design is based on our need to manage a set of ledgers, with a single writer (at any point in time) and a set on consumers that read entries from it. 

The ManagedLedger also takes care of periodically closing ledgers to have a "reasonable" sized sets of ledgers that can individually deleted when no more needed.

I've put on github the interface proposal (along with an early WIP implementation)
