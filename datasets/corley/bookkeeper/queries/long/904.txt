The test checks for message "Address already in use", which is "Indirizzo gi√† in uso"  in Italian.
Maybe it is enough to catch BindException and remove the assertion


Assert.assertTrue("BKServer allowed duplicate startups!",
                    ce.getCause().getMessage().contains("Address already in use"));
