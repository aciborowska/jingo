Scenario:

1) Start three bookies. Create ledger with ensemblesize=3, quorumsize=2
2) Add 100 entries to this ledger
3) Make first bookie down and read the entries from 0-99

Output: Each entry is going to fetch from the failed bookie and is waiting for the bookie connection timeout, only after failure going to next bookie.
This is affecting the read entry performance.

Impact: Namenode switching time will be affected by adding this failed bookie readTimeOut also.
