When a call is made to asyncAddEntry, the byte[] passed must not change until the async confirmation comes back. Otherwise the result is undefined. While for some API this is acceptable, I BK is aimed at applications where buffering may be used. This may force an extra copy before sending the data to BK to ensure the data sticks around. This is pointless as one of the first things addEntry does is make a copy while staging the data to send.
