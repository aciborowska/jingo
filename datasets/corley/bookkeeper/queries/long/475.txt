This test exists to detect the case where a bookie is taken down, and the same another bookie is selected to replace it, but the other bookie is already in the ensemble. BOOKKEEPER-106 fixed this, so it shouldn't happen. However we still need to check. We iterate 10 times, but this is a parametered test, so effectively we iterate 40 times. There's 3 possible bookies to select, two of which are already in the ensemble, so a single iteration, if selecting randomly has a 66% chance of selecting a bad bookie. We have to run four times anyhow because it's a parameterized test, giving us a 66*4 % chance of hitting the bug if we only have one iteration. 

Therefore, we should only iterate once. Also, we don't need to write much data. We only care about whats in zk for this test really.
