Hedwig console currently requires a number of config files to find the cluster. Really it should be sufficient to give it a zookeeper server and let it go from there. Also, it would be good to be able to run hedwig console commands from the commandline. 
i.e. bin/hedwig console --zookeeper zk1:2181 show topics
