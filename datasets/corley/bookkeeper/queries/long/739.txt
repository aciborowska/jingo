A lot of our tests extend BookKeeperClusterTestCase which extends TestCase, which is the junit 3 way of doing tests. Annotations is the junit4 way to doing tests. If you're using a junit3 harness, annotations are ignored. Therefore, most of our timeout annotations are ignored. I propose we move everything to the junit4 style.
