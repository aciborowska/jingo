Hi,
I’m wondering if it is feasible to have a way to launch a Bookie and a Bookkeeper client in the same JVM without using network, valid use cases are:
1) Unit testing 
2) Installations using a single Bookie 

1) Unit testing
For unit testing  I’m using mock classes which reproduce the functions of Bookkeeper but it makes my code more complex. 
Running network-related libraries limits the possibility of running tests in parallel and slows down the overall throughput of the tests

2) Single Bookie deployment
Sometimes I need to launch software which uses Bookkeeper in a single-machine deployment, in this case using an embedded Bookie will let to have only a single JVM process which runs the full stack of the service.

For instance when I’m using Bookkeeper as a commit log I need to implement a commit log which uses Bookkeeper for replicated deployments, a simple “file” based commit log  and a pure in-memory commit log for unit testing.

I think it could be done using Netty LocalServerChannelFactory (and related client-side classes) and some tricks about the use of hostnames, registration on Zookeeper and so on

Of course the same issue will be on Zookkeeper
