1) machine perf10 is rebooted. the bookie server & hub server are not restarted automatically after reboot.
2) client 1 & client 2 are still running. the topics owned in perf10 will be re-assigned to perf8/perf9. but they would fail because not enough bookie servers are available.
3) after 2 hours, we found that perf10 is rebooted. we restarted bookie server & hub server on perf10
4) then we got ServerRedirectLoopException in client.
