Currently, the client-server protocol doesn't let a Hedwig client discover the region that it is a part of. There are a couple of approaches that I could think of to do this - 1) The client publishes and subscribes to a randomly generated topic-name. It can then set it's region to the srcRegion of the received message. 2) Have a discovery operation akin to the publish/subscribe operations and let the server respond to this with information about itself (region name and any other information it might want to pass on to the client). I personally prefer (2). I could produce a patch if the approach looks good.
