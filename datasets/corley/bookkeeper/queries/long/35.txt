We need the ability to make a bookkeeper client force-close a ledger that has been opened (and being written to) by another client. Is that currenly possible?

When a  HDFS namenode failover occurs, the standby namenode would like to ensure that the primary namenode cannot write to the transaction log any more. The standby namenode would first invoke this new bookkeeper API before making himself the primary.
