currently, ZkTopicManager use zookeeper ephemeral node to store the owner information of a topic. so the znode will disappear when the owner hub server is down, the leader election is quite simple based on this model.

but for most key-value storage, there is no similar concepts like ephemeral node, but just providing versioned writes. so it would be better to provide a topic manager using versioned writes.
