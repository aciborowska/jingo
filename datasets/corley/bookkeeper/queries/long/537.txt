This is a master jira to provide better session expire handling for both BOOKKEEPER and Hedwig.

This task could be divided into several tasks:

1) provide a reconnectable zookeeper client, which wrap the zookeeper client. when session is expired, it created a new zookeeper client to replace the expired one.

2) session handling for bookie server

3) session handling for bookkeeper client.

4) session handling for Hedwig. when session is expired, hedwig should disable ensemble change and ledger change. when the client is recovered from session expired state, hedwig enables ensemble change and ledger change, and it would try to reclaim its owned topic.

the works are available in https://github.com/sijie/bookkeeper/commits/retryable_zk_2. will try to generate the patches after 4.2.0 release.
