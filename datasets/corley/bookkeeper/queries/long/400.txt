Detailed discussion at http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/zookeeper-bookkeeper-dev/201209.mbox/%3cCAOLhyDQzrmeOHmTxzPikeAqJ7pZUn0=vHfd=gC1SRmTuye5JeA@mail.gmail.com%3e

We had an internal discussion about this. From BOOKKEEPER-337, it seems that handleBookieFailure could be invoked in parallel by a thread other the one that calls LedgerHandle#sendAddSuccessCallbacks. The values updated by handleBookieFailure might not be visible to the thread running sendAddSuccessCallbacks because the fields are not volatile and this might have caused our bad state. 

BK-337 synchronizes access to metadata.addEnsemble() and we believe this would make this scenario very improbable. 

A long term fix might be to make LedgerMetadata immutable since it is rarely updated.
