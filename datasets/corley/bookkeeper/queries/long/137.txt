This is an optimization to speed up the case where we have many ledgers and are writing to them at random (a benchmark case we currently have). Currently, we create the ledger index file and write the first 1k of it to disk immediately. With a lot of ledgers being randomly written to, this means a lot of random writes on the ledger disk. This fix postpones the creation of the index file and writing of the first 1k until the first flush of the ledger.
