Problem:

currently re-replicator only uses the view of available/readonly bookies right at the time doing bookie checking. it would accidentally treat a bookie disappeared from zookeeper (e.g. zookeeper session expired, bookie restarted, flapping bookie registration due to network/gc) as lost bookies, which introduce unnecessary re-replication.

Solution:

introduce 'auditorStaleBookieInterval', if a bookie never register in the given interval, it would be marked as 'stale' bookies and re-replicate all ledgers belongs to that bookie. the default value is set 30 minutes.

Fixes:


	refactor bookie watcher to allow notifying bookie list thru BookiesListener
	introduce 'auditorStaleBookieInterval' to be able to mark bookies as 'stale' if bookies aren't registered themselves to zookeeper
	add more info logging about critical steps on re-replication logic
	misc changes
