Please can you set up a DOAP for your project and get it added to files.xml?

Please see http://projects.apache.org/create.html

Once you have created the DOAP and committed it to your source code repository, please submit it for inclusion in the Apache projects listing as per:

http://projects.apache.org/create.html#submit

Remember, if you ever move or rename the doap file in future, please
ensure that files.xml is updated to point to the new location.

Thanks!
