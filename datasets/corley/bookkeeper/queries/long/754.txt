we need to optimize the bookie startup logic for the case: if a bookie failed after replaying journal again and again.


	start syncthread before replaying journal, so during journal replaying, the ledger storage could be checkpoint/flushed.
	after journal finished replaying, trigger a fully flush on ledger storage.
