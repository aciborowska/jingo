In our environment, in Salesforce, we are likely to have bookie nodes with different storage capacity: some will have 1TB others might have 3TB. Also, our ledgers are likely going to be long lived. The current ledger placement policy selects the bookies randomly leading to uniform distribution. This would cause some of bookies to reach high utilization while the rest would be underutilized. We need a new ledger placement policy that has higher probability of selecting bookies with higher free disk space than the ones with lower disk free space.
