We have adopted BookKeeper as part of our state management in Onyx 0.8.0 http://www.onyxplatform.org. As part of testing Onyx 0.8.0 we have begun testing with Jepsen, and our first step was testing BookKeeper without any interaction with Onyx.

We have discovered that the BookKeeper servers automatically shutdown without retry upon losing a connection to a quorum of nodes, which is the expected behaviour according to the code.

It is not obvious from the link at http://bookkeeper.apache.org/ under "Documentation / Admin guide", that this is the expected behaviour.

I believe it would be beneficial if this was discussed in the admin documentation.

Cheers
