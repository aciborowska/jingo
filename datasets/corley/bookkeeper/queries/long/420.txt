Improve the distributed lock by giving fair chance to all the RW. Presently few RW can again and again acquire lock and pushing other RW away from rereplication.

Example:
Have five RWs...RW1, RW2, RW3, RW4, RW5. 

Say L0000000004 is underreplicated and RW1 acquired lock. Meantime all others will add watcher to this lock. After replication assume RW2 acquired lock and all others(including RW1) will be adding watcher. Here after RW2 releases, again RW1 can be more aggressive and acquire the lock. This will push others to starvation.
