LocalBookKeeper is initializing the zkclient and immediately trying to create "/ledgers" and "/ledgers/available" znodes without waiting for the ZooKeeper SyncConnected state. The client operation should be guarded with ZKConnectionWatcher.

LocalBookKeeper.java

zkc = new ZooKeeper("127.0.0.1", ZooKeeperDefaultPort, new emptyWatcher());
/*	User for testing purposes, void */
static class emptyWatcher implements Watcher {
public void process(WatchedEvent event) {}
}
