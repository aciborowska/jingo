Currently the AutoRecovery daemon will shut down on SyncDisconnected. This is the wrong behaviour. It should wait until it gets a expired signal before shutting down. If autoRecoveryDaemonEnabled=true, then the autorecovery deamon is running in the same process as the bookie, the bookie death watcher will take down the bookie at this point also, but as the bookie hasn't shutdown, exit code will be 0, which is confusing to any monitoring app.
