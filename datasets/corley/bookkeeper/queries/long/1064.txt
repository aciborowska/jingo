The test is iterating over a hash map that gets updated by a different thread. The map needs to be concurrent.


java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
	at org.apache.bookkeeper.replication.AuditorLedgerCheckerTest.stopAuditorElectors(AuditorLedgerCheckerTest.java:130)
	at org.apache.bookkeeper.replication.AuditorLedgerCheckerTest.tearDown(AuditorLedgerCheckerTest.java:114)



All subsequent tests in the same class are failing because of the 1st test not cleaning up properly.
