Once we enable auto recovery, auditor and replication workers start their activity. Today there is no way to monitor it using counters. This is a bug to track various activities of auditor and replication workers like: 


	Time taken by auditor to build the bookie->ledger list
	No. of under replicated ledgers detected
	Time taken by auditor to publish the under replicated ledger list
	Time taken by auditor to check all the ledgers in the cluster
	No. of ledgers replicated by each replication worker
	No. of entries and bytes of data read and written by each replication worker
	Auditor can also report the distribution of ledgers within the cluster: how many bookies own a piece of ledger, etc.
