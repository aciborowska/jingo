I have started the ZK cluster and when tries to create a BookKeeper client from my application, it is throwing following ZooKeeper ConnectionLossException and is exitting.

When analyzed more, the root cause is:

BookKeeper.java:
--------------------
In the constructor of BookKeeper, immediately after creating the ZK client , it is going to bookieWatcher.readBookiesBlocking() for available bookies from ZK server before reaching SyncConnected event.

I think, we would properly use the existing countdown latch and wait till ZooKeeper client connection establishment before continue reading Bookies.
