bookie tries to extract ledger ids from entry loggers during starting up. if some records corrupted, an IOException is thrown out.

in extractLedgersFromEntryLogs function:

line 459:
                int rc = bc.read(buff, pos);
                if (rc != data.length) 
{
                    throw new IOException("Short read for entryLog " + entryLogId + "@" + pos + "(" + rc + "!="
                            + data.length + ")");
                }
