FUSE module for BookKeeper
Possible Mentor
Ben Reed (breed at apache dot org)

Requirements
C/Java, some networking familiarity

Description
BookKeeper is a distributed write ahead log with client & server written in Java. BookKeeper client & server also use ZooKeeper. There is a BookKeeper API that clients can use to integrate write ahead logging into their application. It would be a lot easier if applications could use BK without changes to the client application through use of a file system api (FUSE). The project would involve implementing a C interface for BookKeeper (Java already exists) and implementing the FUSE module.

Example use: the write ahead log in mysql, called binlogs are typically written to the local filesystem using the std filesystem api. We could modify mysql to use BooKeeper, however if we had a BK FUSE module we could run it (mysql) w/o any modification and get the performance/reliability of a distributed write ahead log.
