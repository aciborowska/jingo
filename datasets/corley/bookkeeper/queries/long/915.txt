ReplicationWorker does not honor Ensemble Placement Policy.
The target bookie in ReplicationWorker should only be able to replicate based on the placement policy, else give up the underreplicated lock. For example, in rackaware policy, the target bookie should only be able to replicate if its not in the same rack as the other bookies in the ensemble, or if there isn't any other bookie available in different racks.
