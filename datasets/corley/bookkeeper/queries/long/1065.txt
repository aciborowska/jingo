In a earlier commit, "BOOKKEEPER-874: Explict LAC from Writer to Bookie", there was this change in the OrderedSafeExecutor implementation: 


         for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
-            queues[i] = new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>();
-            threads[i] =  new ThreadPoolExecutor(1, 1,
-                    0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, queues[i],
+            threads[i] =  new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(1,
                     new ThreadFactoryBuilder()
                         .setNameFormat(name + "-orderedsafeexecutor-" + i + "-%d")
                         .setThreadFactory(threadFactory)
                         .build());
+            threads[i].setMaximumPoolSize(1);



Then, as part of "BOOKKEEPER-1013: Fix findbugs errors on latest master", the max pool size line has been removed.

Without that the thread pool would create multiple threads for the same bucket, breaking the ordering guarantee of the executor.
