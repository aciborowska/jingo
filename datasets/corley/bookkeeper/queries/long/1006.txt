Bookie has had a Zookeeper client for the whole process up to now. This
is only ever used in garbage collection though. This change moves the
creation and usage of the zookeeper client to the garbage collection
thread. It now creates a new zookeeper client for each GC iteration, and
tears it down afterwards. This means that if there is a problem with the
zookeeper connection, it will only exist for one iteration of garbage
 collection.

This work was originally done by Ivan Kelly and I am just pushing it back to open source
