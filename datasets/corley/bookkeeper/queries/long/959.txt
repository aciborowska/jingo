With 4.4.0 we introduced the ability to implement custom authentication plugins.

The new interfaces ClientAuthProvider and BookieAuthProvider depend on ExtensionRegistry, which is a shaded dependency.

As a consequence it is not possibile to implement any custom auth provider in code outside the project, because shaded/relocated dependencies cannot be used.

We need to break the actual interface and introduce a new way to implement such plugins in a portable way
