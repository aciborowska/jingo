after introducing instance id, bookkeeper doesn't provide a tool to upgrade existing clusters to have a valid instance id.

the tool is useful, when you operate multiple bookkeeper clusters and want to move bookies around, you could use 'instanceid' to prevent any bad admin operation. without instanceid, it provides a back hole to break data integrity.
