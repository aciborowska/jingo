Ran into this issue:
due to some misconfiguration of new node and rack assignments we've ended up with nodes being assigned to default rack. We are not using region-aware, only rack-aware policy.
This generates the following sequence of events:

	default rack is /default-region/default-rack even though region-aware is not used.
	other nodes mapped to racks like /rack1, /rack2 etc.
	mixing /region/rack and /rack styles is not allowed, but exception on addition of such nodes is swallowed. All following nodes to add (if there were any) just skipped as result.
