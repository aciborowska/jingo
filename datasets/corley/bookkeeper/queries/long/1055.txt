On each request client and bookies are exchanging the ledger masterKey, which is a 20 bytes MAC digest of the ledger password.

For each request there is a considerable overhead in allocating byte arrays when parsing the add/read requests. 

If the client is a passing an empty password, we should optimize the data path to skip all allocations (related to the masterKey) and instead rely on a static byte array.
