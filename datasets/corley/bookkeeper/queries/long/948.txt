Addition of new ledger or index directories to an existing bookie is disallowed via the cookie check in the bookie start path. Any attempt to add new storage is rejected and the bookie doesn't come up. We have a need to add additional storage to a bookie. This jira is for providing an option to add additional storage to a bookie.
