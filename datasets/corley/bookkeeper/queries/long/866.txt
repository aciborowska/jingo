When write test cases for BOOKKEEPER-865,  It appears that current version of junit could not support some new features well, such as Parameterized test. Then we try to update junit to latest release version, but found " junit.framework.Assert in junit.framework has been deprecated" .  
So using this new ticket to trace this to make the objective more clear.

The fix is simple, 
replace 
import junit.framework.Assert;
to
import org.junit.Assert;
