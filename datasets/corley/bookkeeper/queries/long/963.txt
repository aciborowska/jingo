By configuring multiple journals, we can take advantage of the IO of multiple
disks to increase the write throughput of a single bookie.

Each journal will have its own journal and sync threads and writes will be
assigned to a particular journal by hashing on the ledger id.

In addition to using multiple physical disks, there can improvements even by
using multiple journal on a single SSD device, because these disks can handle
well multiple concurrent writes in different blocks of the disk.
