HedwigRegionTestBase and HedwigHubTestBase duplicate one-another to a large degree (since the latter is the N=1 case of the former.)

Unifying these base classes would be DRYer, and would mean there would be a clear base to build test simplifications on top of.

Additionally, it would be good to be test with multiple regions in more places, and to start and stop hubs and regions within the same test.
