Doing anything with the hedwig java client requires a lot of boilerplate protobuf code.

For example

SubscriptionOptions options = SubscriptionOptions.newBuilder()
     .setCreateOrAttach(CreateOrAttach.CREATE).build();
client.getSubscriber().asyncSubscribe(ByteString.copyFromUtf8("myTopic"),
                                      ByteString.copyFromUtf8("mySubscription"),
                                      options,
                                      myCallback,
                                      myContext);


It would be nice to be able to write something like

client.getSubscriber().asyncSubscriber(_s("myTopic"), _s("mySubscription"), 
                                       _subOpts(CreateOrAttach.CREATE),
                                       myCallback, myContext);



For this we need a ClientUtils class with statics. This JIRA is to create that class and discuss what should be in it.
