BOOKKEEPER-203 introduced changes to LedgerLayout to include ManagerFactoryClass instead of ManagerFactoryName.

So because of this, BKJM cannot shade the bookkeeper-server jar inside BKJM jar

LAYOUT znode created by BookieServer is not readable by the BKJM as it have classes in hidden packages. (same problem vice versa)
