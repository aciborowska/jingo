If last record in entry log file is truncated (length of data is short than expected length), bookie went into infinite loop on reading this record.

A truncated record can be caused in following cases:
1) bookie server is killed during bookie restart to relay logs.
2) bookie server is killed when bookie does adding entry operation.
