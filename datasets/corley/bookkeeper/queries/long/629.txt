Register the bookie with hostname:port and also store the bookie addresses as hostname:port in ledger metadata files instead of ip:port

This will help users to change the machine IP if they want without loosing their data.

Supporting hostname based installation/functionality is one of the important requirement of users.

Any thoughts?
