ClientConfiguration is always adding System.getProperties()


 protected AbstractConfiguration() {
        super();
        // add configuration for system properties
        addConfiguration(new SystemConfiguration());
    }



This is useful is some cases but sometimes it is very harmful because the user could modify the client behaviour inadvertently, for instance:: throttle, readTimeout....
