In PendingReadOp, there is an error message that is printed each time a read on a specific bookie is failing: 


LOG.error("Read of ledger entry failed: L{} E{}-E{}, Heard from {}. First unread entry is {}",
    new Object[] { lh.getId(), startEntryId, endEntryId, heardFromHosts, firstUnread });



This message is getting printed each time a ledger is recovered and there is no error, since the ledger recovery logic is to keep reading and incrementing the entryId until a NoEntry error is received.

This log message should be set at debug level.
