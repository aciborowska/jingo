When checking out from trunk, and after installing zookeeper and zookeeper test artifacts in the local maven repo, and compiling protocol buffers, the build does not work out of the box (either mvn package or mvn -fae test).

I had to modify several files for managing to run the build without issues.

These modifications are included in the attached patch.
