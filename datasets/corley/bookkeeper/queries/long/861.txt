I found a couple of bugs in TestZooKeeperClient which were causing the build to fail for me. The two problems I found are related to the the retry logic object in ZooKeeperClient. We allow it to be null and because we are not setting it properly on the test cases, it was causing an NPE for me. I'll submit a patch shortly.
