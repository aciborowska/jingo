In multiple places, (eg: journal, ordered executor, etc..), we are using LinkedBlockingQueue instances to pass objects between threads.

The LinkedBlockingQueue differs from the ArrayBlockingQueue in that it doesn't require to define a max queue size, though, being implemented with a linked list, it requires to allocates list nodes each time an item is added.

We can use a GrowableArrayBlockingQueue that behaves in the same way as the LinkedBlockingQueue, but it's implemented with an array that can be resized when the queue reaches the capacity.
