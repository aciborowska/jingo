The auditor doesn't pick up a bookie shut down from read only mode. The watcher on child nodes of "/ledgers/available" node on zk doesn't get triggered if there is any change in the children of any of those child nodes ("/ledgers/available/readonly").

Solution:
The auditor needs to set another child watcher on read only bookie node on zk.
