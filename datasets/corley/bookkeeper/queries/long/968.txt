Caught this issue on the servers with 128G of RAM. This is probably not an issue on servers/VMs with less RAM.

With current implementation we end up with single entry log flush during log rotation.
OS tries to flush everything as fast as possible and saturates disk. This results in long periods of high latency (reads and writes).
