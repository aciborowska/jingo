Scenario:
========
Configure journal dir like following ../journalDir

Start bookkeeper like following "/home/Brahma/BK/bookkeeper/bin/bookkeeper bookie"
Here bookie start up will fail like following..

HOST-*******:/home/JUNE12/install # /home/Brahma/BK/bookkeeper/bin/bookkeeper bookie
HOST-******:/home/JUNE12/install # Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: Directory(../journalDir) isn't a directory
	at org.apache.bookkeeper.bookie.Bookie.checkDirectoryLayoutVersion(Bookie.java:491)
	at org.apache.bookkeeper.bookie.Bookie.<init>(Bookie.java:255)
	at org.apache.bookkeeper.proto.BookieServer.<init>(BookieServer.java:64)
	at org.apache.bookkeeper.proto.BookieServer.main(BookieServer.java:249)
Since journal dir will be configured like ../journaldir in bookie_conf...It's not able to resolve..But in zookeeper case,it'll work fine..
