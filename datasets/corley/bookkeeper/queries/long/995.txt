With rackaware ensemble placement we get guaranteed writes to at least 2 different racks for every write quorum. We want to extend this such that user can ask for writes to at least 3 or more racks per write quorum. This is useful to ensure higher availability when one of the racks is already down: the remaining copies are guaranteed to be on different racks and hence can with stand another rack failure assuming the write quorum is 3.
