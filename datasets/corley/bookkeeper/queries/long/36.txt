The way we currently throttle on the client is by counting the number of outstanding operation on LedgerHandle, and having the application select what an appropriate value is. This is not a good way of doing it because the application has to guess what a good value is. We need to implement some form of backpressure instead to make sure we throttle only when the system is saturated.
