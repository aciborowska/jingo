In order to support multiplexing, we needs following protocol changes in Hedwig.

1) add a CloseSubscription request.

currently closeSubscription is directly close the channel. but for a multiplexing channel, we should not close the channel directly. we need to send CloseSubscription request to hub server to tell hub server close subscription (stopServingSubscriber)

2) add a QueryOwner request type.

for a multiplexing channel, we had to know the topic owner first and submit the subscribe request to the channel established to topic owner.

3) add a SubscriptionEventResponse response.

in multiplexing mode, hub server should not close the channel directly when topic is release periodically or force closed by other subscription (introduced in BOOKKEEPER-252). so hub server needs to notify the clients that a topic is released or subscription is forced closed.

the subscription event response carries an event to tell client what happened to the subscription.
