I am not sure if it is a but or not.

Say, I do have pc with 256 cores, and there is following code in bookkeeper:
BookKeeper.java
OrderedSafeExecutor callbackWorker = new OrderedSafeExecutor(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());
OrderedSafeExecutor mainWorkerPool = new OrderedSafeExecutor(Runtime .getRuntime().availableProcessors());


As I understand, callbackWorker is not used at all, so it could be removed.
Also could be required to get more control over mainWorkerPool (say, extract interface + pass instance through contructor).

Myabe there are other places in library where some thread pools are created without ability to reuse existing thread pools in application.
