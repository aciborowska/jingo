This test was created to catch the BOOKKEEPER-5, which is where we hang due to orphaned netty connections. Netty connections are made when we first send an add entry to the bookie. 

The creates 10000 ledgers, and writes 200 entries to across these (note, this is not 200 each, but 200 across all ledgers). Therefore, a maximum 200 connections could be created. So the test isn't doing what it think it is doing.

The test takes between 4 & 7 minutes (most of this time creating unused ledgers) on jenkins. It is then run 4 times as BookieReadWriteTest is a Parameterized test.

This adds up to 28 minutes to a build on jenkins. This test should take no longer than 30 seconds.
