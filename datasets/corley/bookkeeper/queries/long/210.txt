If I start bookies and do nothing, I keep getting error messages like this:


2012-04-05 23:04:14,612 - INFO  [GarbageCollectorThread:GarbageCollectorThread@266] - Deleting entryLogId 0 as it has no active ledgers!
2012-04-05 23:04:14,612 - ERROR [GarbageCollectorThread:EntryLogger@188] - Trying to delete an entryLog file that could not be found: 0.log
2012-04-05 23:04:14,613 - INFO  [GarbageCollectorThread:GarbageCollectorThread@266] - Deleting entryLogId 1 as it has no active ledgers!

This is not really an error since no ledger has been created. This is misleading.
