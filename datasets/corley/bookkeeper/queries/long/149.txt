This method currently returns null. (see https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/trunk/hedwig-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hedwig/client/netty/HedwigSubscriber.java#L436 )

A possible implementation would use a control message, like subscription messages. But that will require modifications to the protocol definition. Maybe there is another way?
