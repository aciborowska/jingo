Currently we had some bookie related data stored in ZooKeeper liked cookie. When we run BookKeeperAdmin to manually recover a bookie, it would be better to remove its related bookie data from ZooKeeper after recover successfully. otherwise, its zombie data would be still in ZooKeeper even we retired that bookie node.
