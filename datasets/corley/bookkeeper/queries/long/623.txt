With the almost same testcase mentioned in the BOOKKEEPER-584, Ledger metadata is getting added with extra segment during failure handling of bookies along with fencing. 

Only difference in the testcase is .
1. Before bookie failures some entries were already written
2. And after bookies failed ( First bookie will throw LedgerFenced/Unauthorized exception, and second bookie is slow/dead bookie ), Number of entries written asynchrounously is n*ensembleSize+1

Note that, Unauthorized/FencedException callback comes first, then other bookie failure callback comes.

I will attach a TestCase along with patch for this shortly. Testcase is modified version of attached testcase in BOOKKEEPER-584
