Currently, SyncThread made a checkpoint too frequently, which affects performance. data is writing to entry logger file might be blocked by syncing same entry logger file, which affect bookie to achieve higher throughput. We could schedule checkpoint only when rotating an entry log file. so new incoming entries would be written to newer entry log file and old entry log file could be synced.
