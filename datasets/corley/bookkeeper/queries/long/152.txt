Suppose we have a unclosed ledger L, whose ensemble size is 2, quorum size is 2. the ledger's current ensemble is <bk1, bk2>.

bk2 is crashed. 

we use recovery tool to recover entries in bk2. $ bookkeeper-server/bin/bookkeeper org.apache.bookkeeper.tools.BookKeeperTools bk2 

recovery failed due to recovery tool can't open ledger L, since ledger L doesn't have enough quorum to readLastConfirmed entry. (asyncOpenLedgerNoRecovery)
