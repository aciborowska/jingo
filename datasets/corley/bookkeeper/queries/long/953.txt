Use more conventional patterns in usage warning messages ..

Eg  

usage: listbookies  [-readwrite|-readonly] [-hostnames]

ought to be 

usage: listbookies  (-readwrite|-readonly) [-hostnames]


.. if exactly one of -readwrite|-readonly are required as per the warning ...


$ bin/bookkeeper shell listbookies
20:23:17,808 ERROR One and only one of -readwrite and -readonly must be specified
listbookies: List the bookies, which are running as either readwrite or readonly mode.
usage: listbookies  [-readwrite|-readonly] [-hostnames]
 -h,--hostnames    Also print hostname of the bookie
 -ro,--readonly    Print readonly bookies
 -rw,--readwrite   Print readwrite bookies



There might be other instances so I suggest they are listed here and done in one go.
