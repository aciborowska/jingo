suppose a ledger is created as ensemble size 3 and quorum size 3.
3 entries is added in this ledger, entry ids are 0, 1, 2.

this ledger is not closed. then a bookie server is down.

the ledger is opened. it would be recovered in following steps:
1) retrieve LAC from all bookie ensemble to get maxAddConfirmed. then maxAddPushed would be 2 and maxAddConfirmed would be 1. then lastAddConfirmed would be 1.
2) doRecovery read lastAddConfirmed + 1 (2). it would return right data since there is still 2 replicas.
3) doRecovery add entry 2. but it would fail since there is not enough bookies to form a new ensemble.
4) this ledger will be closed with lastAddConfirmed (1). entry 2 will be lost.

this issue happened in hub server. old ledger will be recovered and closed when changing ownership. so published messages would be lost.

we should not close ledger when we encountered exception during recovery adding, otherwise we would lose entries.
