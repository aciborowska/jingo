This JIRA to discuss authentication mechanism of bookie clients and server. Assume ZK provides fully secured communication channel using Kerberos based authentication and authorization model. We could also manage and renew users authenticated to BK via Kerberos. There is currently no configuration or hooks for the Bookie process to obtain Kerberos credentials.

Today an unauthenticated bookie client can easily establish connection with the bookkeeper server.
