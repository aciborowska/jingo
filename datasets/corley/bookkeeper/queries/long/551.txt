When topic is acquired in BookkeeperPersistenceManager#recoverLastTopicLedgerAndOpenNewOne(), empty ledger is just ignored:

if (numEntriesInLastLedger <= 0) {
    // this was an empty ledger that someone created but
    // couldn't write to, so just ignore it
    logger.info("Pruning empty ledger: " + ledgerId + " for topic: " + topic.toStringUtf8());
    closeLedger(ledgerHandle);
    openNewTopicLedger(topic, expectedVersionOfLedgerNode, topicInfo,
                       expectedStartSeqId, false, cb, ctx);
    return;
}


So these empty ledgers are leaked since its metadata is not deleted.
