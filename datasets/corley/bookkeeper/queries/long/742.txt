If a ledger is open and empty, when a bookie in the ensemble crashes no recovery will take place (because there's nothing to recover). This open empty unrepaired ledger can persist for a long time. If it loses another bookie, it can lose quorum. At this point it's impossible for the bookie to know that its an empty ledger, and the admin gets notified of missing data.
