A lots of things needs to run in FIFODeliveryManager, #startServingSubscription, #stopServingSubscriber, resuming throttled subscriber and delivering first message for each started subscriber. It would increment latency for delivering message or sending response for stopServingSubscriber (response for closeSubscription, or subscription event when force attach or topic release).

It is similar as what readahead cache happened before.
