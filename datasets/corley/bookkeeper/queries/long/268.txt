This is related to JIRA BookKeeper 181 (scaling BookKeeper metadata storage). We propose to implement an abstract metadata plugin API s.t. different implementation of metadata store can be used in BookKeeper. The first effort is trying to have ZooKeeper metadata plugin API implemented as 1) proof of concept; 2) backward compatibility.
