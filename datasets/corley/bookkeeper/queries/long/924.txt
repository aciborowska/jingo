LedgerHandle sync interface heavily depends on SyncCounter to convert async interfaces
into sync interfaces.

Usaylly

SyncCounter.inc()
asyncCall()
SyncCOunter.block(0)

The block code is.

   synchronized void block(int limit) throws InterruptedException {
        while (i > limit) {
            int prev = i;
            wait();
            if (i == prev) 
{
                break;
            }
        }
    }

Since 'i' is going to be same as 'prev' on spurious wakeup, and wait() can return on spurious wakeups.
