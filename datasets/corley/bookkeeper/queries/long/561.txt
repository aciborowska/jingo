Findbugs reports a lot of error about a null pointer dereference for System.out

http://sourceforge.net/p/findbugs/bugs/918/?page=0

The solution is to upgrade to a newer findbugs, but this is a bit stricter, so there's some fixes needed. This jira is for the upgrade and those fixes, and also to fix/exclude the errors introduced by BOOKKEEPER-312.
