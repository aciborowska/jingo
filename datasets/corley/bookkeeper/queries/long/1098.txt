getLedgerToReplicate leaves watches each time it traverses the
tree until it finds a suitable replication target.  Since we don't have
a way of canceling watches, these watches tend to get abandoned,
particularly on interior nodes, which aren't changed much.  Thus,
over time, some nodes would build up a very large number of watches.
