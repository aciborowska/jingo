If you open two ledger handles pointing to the same ledger, using the same client, you will not be able to read from both. This is due to them sharing PerChannelBookieClient instances. PerChannelBookieClient has a member 

    ConcurrentHashMap<CompletionKey, ReadCompletion> readCompletions = new ConcurrentHashMap<CompletionKey, ReadCompletion>();


where CompletionKey is the ledgerId and entryId. If both LedgerHandles try to read the same entryId, they'll override each other on this hashmap.
