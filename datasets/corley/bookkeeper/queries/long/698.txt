'timeoutExecutor' is leaking for every bookie client, it should be closed during bookie client closure. I've seen in tests, scheduler is running and periodically executing the TimeoutTask even after bk client closure.

Also, timeoutExecutor is missing thread name. IMHO, no need to raise another issue, just including the small change with this JIRA.
