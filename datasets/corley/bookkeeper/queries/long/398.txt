We have been experimenting with using the Twitter stats package (http://twitter.github.com/commons/apidocs/com/twitter/common/stats/package-summary.html) for exporting hedwig stats over HTTP. This is open-sourced under the Apache license. The motivation for this was better logging of percentile latencies and requests-per-second (which are difficult to measure with the current implementation of hedwig stats). Is this something the community would be interested in? If so, I could work on a patch.
