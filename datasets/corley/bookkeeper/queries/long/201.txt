As per a conversation with Ivan and Ben, we propose an interface that enables an operator to make a bookie disk inactive. The general idea is that if a bookie has multiple ledger disks and one is continuously underperforming, then we would like to tell the bookie to stop creating ledgers on that disk. Eventually the bookie stops using that disk.
