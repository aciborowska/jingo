    make logger as a static variable
    not all logger in bookkeeper & hedwig are static. some class like PendnigReadOp and LedgerEntry would have lots of objects, it might be bad. so this task is to make logger as a static variable if it didn't.

    with benefit, cleaning up the imports when touching that file.
