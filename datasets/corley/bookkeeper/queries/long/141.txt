Currently bookie server do extracting ledger id from entry log files when creating a new entry log.

When we have lots of entry logs, we have to scan all these entry log files, then bookie server will be blocked until finished extraction. 

But it is not necessary. Since extraction is only for garbage collection, we can do extraction in GC thread before gc entry log files.
