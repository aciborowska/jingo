This JIRA adds support for protecting the state of Bookkeeper znodes on a multi-tenant ZooKeeper cluster.

Use case: When user tries to run a ZK cluster in multitenant mode,  where more than one client service would like to share a single ZK service instance (cluster). In this case the client services typically want to protect their data (ZK znodes) from access by other services (tenants) on the cluster. Say you are running BK, HBase or ZKFC instances, etc... having authentication/authorization on the znodes is important for both security and helping to ensure that services don't interact negatively (touch each other's data).
Presently Bookkeeper does not have support for authentication or authorization while accessing to ZK. This should be added to the BK clients/server that are accessing the ZK cluster. In general it means calling addAuthInfo once after a session is established
