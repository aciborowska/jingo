Scenario:-

Say L0001 has ensemble bookies BK1, BK2, BK3.
Publishing BK1 failure: replicaMgr.markLedgerUnderreplicated(L0001, BK1);
Publishing BK2 failure: replicaMgr.markLedgerUnderreplicated(L0001, BK2);

For the second invocation urLedger metadata is updating BK2 twice as follows:
1=replica: "BK1", 1=replica: "BK2", 1=replica: "BK2"
