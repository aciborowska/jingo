bookkeeper recovery improvement (part-3): add a ReadEntryListener to callback on individual request.


	add read entry listener which allow doing batch read, but callback on individual entries in sequence. so in recovery op, we could issue batch reads, then on each individual callback do add entry and stop when received NoSuchEntry.
