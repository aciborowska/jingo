I've noticed this while inspecting the output in jenkins:


Running org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BookKeeperCloseTest
Tests run: 10, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 12.074 sec
Running org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LocalBookKeeperTest
Running org.apache.bookkeeper.meta.GcLedgersTest



It sounds like LocalBookKeeperTest is failing silently. Is it hanging and timing out?
