as BOOKKEEPER-539 and , some test cases failed due to #stopServingSubscriber issue. Although BOOKKEEPER-529 works out a patch to fix such race condition, it would be better to ensure #stopServingSubscriber when channel is disconnected, to avoid other kind of race and also cleanup the memory.

(I don't mean to block 4.2.0 release, but there are some test cases found failed related #stopServingSubscriber. so it would be better to handle it before 4.2.0)
