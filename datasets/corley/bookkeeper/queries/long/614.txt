Currently we collect stats though JMX. Adding a new stat to JMX is cumbersome, and reading the stats out of JMX is painful if you're not on the same machine. As a consequence, we aren't measuring a fraction of the stuff we should be.

There are a couple of nice stats packages out there, such as twitter-stats[1] and codahale metrics[2], which would make collection of stats much easier.

This JIRA is to provide a generic interface, which a metrics backend can be plugged into.
