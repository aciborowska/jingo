Google protobufs is a library for serializing and deserializing data. It elegantly handles the cases where new data is added to a data format. This is useful in the case of something like LedgerMetadata, which may change over time. However, at the moment, whenever we make a change to the LedgerMetadata serialization format we have to break compatibility with old clients. By using protobufs, even if we add something to the format, old clients should be able to read the ledgers. 

We should also change our protocols to use protobufs for the same reason, but this should be done in 4.3.0.
