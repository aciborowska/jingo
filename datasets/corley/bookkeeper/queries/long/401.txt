Consider the following case: 
Ensemble is A, B, C
It changes to A, B, D locally and an update to write to ZK is in progress. 
We get a write request that writes to this ensemble, receives responses and acks back a success. 
The ensemble write to zk fails. We've acked an add for which there is no information in zookeeper.
