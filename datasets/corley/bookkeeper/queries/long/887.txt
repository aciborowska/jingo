Using multiple independent journals in the bookie can improve the bookie throughput and write latencies. 

When using HDDs for the journal, the writes and fsyncs can be spread across multiple discs (or RAID groups) on different filesystem mount points. 
If the journal is writing to an SSD, having multiple journal threads writing to the same disc will let the bookie to better utilize the disk write bandwidth.
