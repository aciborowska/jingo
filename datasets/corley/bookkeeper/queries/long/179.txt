This TODO is in the BookKeeper class, in the zookeeper watcher. If the zookeeper handle is not valid any longer, then the client cannot close a ledger or update a ledger ensemble. In both cases, a client wouldn't be able to make progress with open ledgers. We have mechanisms to take care of it, so there is no correctness concern. However, it is not desirable to have to drop all open ledgers because of a session expiration.
