Consider the following scenario

	currently bookie is in writemode but it is close to the diskusagethreshold and also entrymemtable is close to skipListSizeLimit
	it received a addentry call, and now the size of the entrymemtable is greater than skipListSizeLimit
	so onSizeLimitReached of SortedLedgerStorage will be called and now lets assume that memtable flush has failed because of diskusagethreshold
	because of previous step, bookie would turn to readonly
	now lets assume after certain rounds of compaction bookie reclaimed sufficient storage and went back to writemode
	now bookie would be receiving addentry calls
	because of outstanding snapshot from previous memtable flush failure, it will never retry to flush memtable
	now the memory start keep going up and up and the process memory gets bloated
