There are currently 2 methods named "consume" in the client API:

	in org.apache.hedwig.client.api.MessageHandler : delegates the processing of a message by a message handler
	in org.apache.hedwig.client.api.Subscriber : notifies the server that messages have been processed till a given sequence id. This is some kind of acknowledgement.



I don't think these 2 fundamental methods should be named the same: they have different purposes and it is confusing.

Couldn't we rename Subscriber.consume into Subscriber.acknowledge, or something similar?
