Current bookie compaction in GarbageCollector has setting: 'compactionRate'. It is throttling and limiting the compaction by entries. 
But from a bandwidth perspective, it would be good that we could throttle and limit compaction by bytes, which would really reflect the bandwidth of disk. 

So in this enhancement, we added another "by bytes" option when doing compaction in GarbageCollector:
"boolean isThrottleByBytes": true when use by bytes, false when use by entries;
"int compactionRateByEntries": by entries, number of concurrent entries;
"int compactionRateByBytes": by bytes, number of bytes of entries before flush.
