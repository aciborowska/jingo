BookKeeper is currently using SLF4J 1.6.4. By upgrading to 1.7x, the most visible change would be to be able to pass a variable number of arguments without needing to wrap them into a:

log.info("msg: {} {} {}", new Object[] {x, y, x});
// versus
log.info("msg: {} {} {}", x, y, x);



SLF4J 1.7 has been around since 2012.
