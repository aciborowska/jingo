Every time a ledger is opened/closed at least two lines at level INFO are written to the application log.
In the case of "tailing" a ledger I open/close ledgers many times an so application log are filled up of this kind of lines:

Registered ledger metadata listener ReadOnlyLedgerHandle(lid = 29152, id = 1405806205) on ledger 29152.
Unregistered ledger metadata listener ReadOnlyLedgerHandle(lid = 29152, id = 1405806205) on ledger 29152.



I would like to decrease the log level to "TRACE" instead of "INFO" in AbstractZkLedgerManager.java

LOG.info("Registered ledger metadata listener {} on ledger {}.", listener, ledgerId);
LOG.info("Unregistered ledger metadata listener {} on ledger {}.", listener, ledgerId);
