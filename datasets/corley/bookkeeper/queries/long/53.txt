outstandingMsgSet is a Set, so it is not thread-safe. The detail is as below:

MessageConsumeRetryTask is In a timer, so in timer thread, when the timer is up, it will cause a outstandingMsgSet add operation:
MessageConsumeRetryTask.run() -> outstandingMsgSet.add(message) -> outstandingMsgSet.add(message)

At the same time, in other thread(maybe main thread), there may be other operations of this outstandingMsgSet:
MessageConsumeCallback.operationFinished() -> messageConsumed(Message message) -> outstandingMsgSet.remove(message);
