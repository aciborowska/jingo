Currently, we don't look at ledger metadata when delete ledgers. So when a client is opening/writing a ledger and other client delete it, the behavior is undefined.
So we would suggest if a client is writing/recovery a ledger, we should not delete it. We can change the behavior of ledger deletion to perform a conditional remove only when the state of ledger is CLOSED.
