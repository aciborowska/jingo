Throttling on the NIOServerFactory is broken. There is a variable outstandingRequests which is decremented when a request is completed, but is never incremented. If this value is greater than 2000, then no more requests are accepted. Once a bookie has received 2^31+2000 requests, the bookie will hang forever. This needs to be removed.
