Scenario:
------------
1. Ledger is created with ensemble and quorum size as 2, written with one entry
2. Now first bookie is in the ensemble is made down.
3. Another client fence and trying to recover the same ledger
4. During this time ensemble change will happen and new bookie will be added. But this bookie is not able to connect.
5. This recovery will fail.
7. Now previously added bookie came up.
8. Another client trying to recover the same ledger.
9. Since new bookie is first in the ensemble, doRecoveryRead() is reading from that bookie and getting NoSuchLedgerException and closing the ledger with -1

i.e. Marking the ledger as empty, even though first client had successfully written one entry.
