Observed two potential cases about the HashedWheelTimer usage:

	Unnecessary creation of HashedWheelTimer for each channel connection establishment. Instead of creating for each channel connection, we could create one timer per bookie client and close it during permanent closure.
	Handle IllegalStateException of HashedWheelTimer.releaseExternalResources()
