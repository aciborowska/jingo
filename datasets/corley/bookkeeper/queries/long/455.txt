The entries sent by bookkeeper client can be out of order (due to network). The client uses queue to track last-confirmed-entry-id correctly.

The bookie server will happily persist the entries out of order, i.e. gaps are possible. If bookie crash, the recovery can cause last-confirmed-entry-id to be set to the last-entry persisted by bookie. The gap is not tracked nor detected at server side.
