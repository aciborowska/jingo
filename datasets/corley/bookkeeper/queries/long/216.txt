there is typo in Bookie#shutdown. so it doesn't quit with right exit code when encountering exceptions.

    synchronized int shutdown(int exitCode) {
        try {
            if (running) { // avoid shutdown twice
                // the exitCode only set when first shutdown usually due to exception found
                this.exitCode = exitCode;
                // mark bookie as in shutting down progress
                shuttingdown = true;
                // shut down gc thread, which depends on zookeeper client
                // also compaction will write entries again to entry log file
                gcThread.shutdown();
                // Shutdown the ZK client
                if(zk != null) zk.close();
                this.interrupt();
                this.join();
                syncThread.shutdown();

                // Shutdown the EntryLogger which has the GarbageCollector Thread running
                entryLogger.shutdown();
                // close Ledger Manager
                ledgerManager.close();
                // setting running to false here, so watch thread in bookie server know it only after bookie shut down
                running = false;
            }    
        } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
            LOG.error("Interrupted during shutting down bookie : ", ie); 
        }    
        return exitCode;
    }
