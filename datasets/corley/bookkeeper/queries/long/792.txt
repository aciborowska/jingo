Right now, to include bookkeeper as a dependency, you need to include org.apache.bookkeeper:bookkeeper-server

This pulls in all the bookkeeper-server code, and all the server dependencies as well as the client. The server dependencies are larger than the client dependencies. For one thing, it pulls in jna and log4j which should never be pulled in from the client.
