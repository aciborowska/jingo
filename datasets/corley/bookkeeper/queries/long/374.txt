We observed the following behavior when some of the bookkeeper jobs were abruptly restarted a few times.

When the bookies and hedwig hubs were restarted, the hubs tried to query the entries for a particular topic, but an exception was always returned and the reads never completed successfully. 

Eventually, we found that the ledger from which entries couldn't be read actually had 2 index files on disk. We use multiple ledger directories. The first file was in ledger directory number 2 and had a size of 0. The other file which actually contained all the data was in directory 4. 

It doesn't seem right that one ledger has 2 index files. Also, the findIndexFile() function returns the first found ledger index file. Should this be patched to 
1) Throw an exception if more than one file exists (if that's the expected behavior)
2) Do something else?

Any thoughts?

Edit: 
For another ledger, there were 2 files again, created within a minute of each other, on separate directories and with the same size. 

I ran bin/bookie shell ledger -m <ledger_number>. For the most recent file, all entries were N/A, but the other file had all the actual entries. 

So, returning the most recent file might not be the best approach? Should we perhaps check all files?
