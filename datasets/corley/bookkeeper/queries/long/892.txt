Bookie Shell should have a sanity test to identify any problems with the local bookie that is still registered in ZK.

Solution:
Add a sanity test to the bookie shell that will create a ledger locally, write/read few entries and delete the ledger. To test only the local bookie, the ledger ensemble size will be 1 and we implement a LocalBookieEnsemblePlacementPolicy.
