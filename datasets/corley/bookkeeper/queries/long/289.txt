some test output files are not removed when 'mvn clean'.
these files are

1. latencyDump.dat generated by bookkeeper-benchmark
2. derby.log generated by LocalDBPersistenceManager test

besides that build directory in hedwig-server used by ZooKeeper ClientBase testcase is in top-level directory of hedwig-server. it would be better to move it to target directory.
