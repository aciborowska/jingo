TestRegionAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy#testNewEnsembleWithThreeRegions is failing because RegionAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy is not working as expected.

The current allocation policy is not evenly across the regions. The write quorum size is also not calculated correctly.

We need  to fix the placement policy and then fix the the test case.
