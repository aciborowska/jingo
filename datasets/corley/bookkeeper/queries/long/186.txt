Permit is not releasing in the case when there is no quorum available and the readEntries operation failed from all replicas.

Following is the condition where it checks the failure in quorum and invoking ReadCallback:

void sendRead(ArrayList<InetSocketAddress> ensemble, LedgerEntry entry, int lastErrorCode) {
   if (entry.nextReplicaIndexToReadFrom >= lh.metadata.quorumSize) {
      // we are done, the read has failed from all replicas, just fail the
      // read
      submitCallback(lastErrorCode);
      return;
   }
