In createNewLog(), only one directory is searched to check for duplicate log id.
Then the id is used to overwrite lastLogId.

It looks like regression from BOOKKEEPER-345. 

     // It would better not to overwrite existing entry log files
    File newLogFile = null;
        do {
            String logFileName = Long.toHexString(++logId) + ".log";
            File dir = ledgerDirsManager.pickRandomWritableDir();
            newLogFile = new File(dir, logFileName);
            currentDir = dir;
            if (newLogFile.exists()) 
{
                LOG.warn("Found existed entry log " + newLogFile
                        + " when trying to create it as a new log.");
                newLogFile = null;
                continue;
            }
        } while (newLogFile == null);
